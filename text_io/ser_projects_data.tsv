However, this area has experienced recurrent wildfires in recent decades, including large wildfires. Rural abandonment has also contributed to landscape homogenization, and the dominance of woody communities. This project aims to develop a mosaic landscape with shrub formations, dry grasslands, and grasslands to allow the recovery of ecological interactions, ecosystem functionality and biodiversity, and protect habitats of interest. The wide diversity of actions planned aim to (i) reduce the continuity of vegetation to prevent large fires, increasing forest resistance and resilience to forest fires, (ii) increase ecosystem resistance and resilience to climate change and drought, (iii) increase the surface area of suitable habitat for large wild herbivores, (iv) meet specific objectives in relation to biodiversity, fire prevention, recovery of agricultural uses and hunting. The mosaic will also contribute to soil stabilization, regulate the hydrological cycle, stabilize carbon and nutrients, protect biodiversity, including pollinators, and increase the extent of quality pastures for wild ungulates.Agriculture & Livestock, Fire & Weather Events Agriculture, forestry, and livestock husbandry:
Rural depopulation and abandonment of traditional agricultural uses have caused a loss of the mosaic of habitats characteristic of this territory, and an increase in of forest extent and continuity. Environmental homogenization, together with other factors, such as the increase in temperature and changes in the rainfall patterns in a context of climate change, increase vulnerability to wildfires, and the loss of relevant ecosystem services in the region, such as melliferous potential, habitat for some plant species,  especially grassland species, or a deterioration of the quality of the habitat for large mammals fauna (which are hunted; especially ibex and mouflon).
Wildfires:
In the last decades of the 20th century, the severity and recurrence of forest wildfires have substantially changed, including the occurrence of large forest fires (>500 ha). Over the last fifty years, five major fires +10,000 ha each have occurred in the area, increasing landscape homogenization, affecting biodiversity, decreasing the supply of ecosystem services, and raising social concern. The area is located in the Caroig massif (Valencia, Spain). The dominant soil types are calcareous fluvisols, eutric regosols, calcaric regosols, leptosols, calcium kastanozems, calcium cambisols and chromic luvisols. The Caroig massif is a large reservoir of groundwater due to the abundance of limestone and dolomite favoring infiltration, and the presence of underlying less permeable Keuper clays. The area is integrated in the Natura 2000 Network (SAC Muela de Cortes y el Caroche; ES5233040), which highlights its high environmental value. In addition, it has a very high landscape quality, according to PATFOR, and houses various Habitats of Community Interest, species protected by the Valencian Catalogue of Threatened Flora Species and wild herbivores represented by ibex, mouflon, deer, fallow deer and roe deer.
The non-wooded stratum is the most abundant, and is dominated by homogeneous high thickets of garrigue, and shrublands dominated by rosemary and rockroses. Low thickets are dominated by thyme and chamomile. Trees occupy 30% of the area, with Pinus halepensis being the most abundant species. Adult pine forests are usually accompanied by a shrubby and regenerated layer of very dense pine forest, which increases biomass vertical and horizontal continuity and the risk of frequent and severe wildfires. Young pine forests, recruited after previous wildfires, are very dense, favouring fire propagation and severity, compromising regeneration after further disturbances as the probability to reach maturity is low under increasing wildfire frequency, and increase competition for soil resources.
Vast expanses of continuous and uniform vegetation are prone to sustaining large wildfires, and scarcely resilient to climate change. In addition, landscape homogenization is made at the expense of habitats for large herbivores, beta biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services.
The Operational Program of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) of the Valencian Community establishes, as one of its general objectives, to finance actions that improve and guarantee the conservation status of habitats of community interest. Large areas of the SAC present a successional blockade, due to the degradation of their habitats caused by recent changes in land use and recurrent wildfires. This limits ecosystems’ ability to adapt to climate change, and decreases their resilience to new wildfires, and puts the conservation of habitats of community interest at risk.
The project integrates the perception of a wide range of stakeholders, including local people, through the development of three complementary activities:

Participatory process carried out within the framework of the TERECOVA research project (www.recuperandonuestrospaisajes.org) to identify restoration priorities, weigh ecosystem services and plan restoration actions in Enguera Forest Management Unit.
Participatory workshop held at Bicorp (Valencia), where stakeholders discussed restoration priorities and ecosystem services supplied by the local landscape. Work developed by the CEAM Foundation and the University of Alicante within the framework of the COSTERA project.
Review of the project. The draft project was reviewed by a stakeholder platform. They analysed its contents and suggested modifications. Recommendations that the drafting team considered feasible were included in the final version of the proposal.

This project is part of the strategy defined by the Forest Territorial Action Plan of the Valencian Community (PATFOR;  https://agroambient.gva.es/va/web/medio-natural/patfor). The objectives of the action are founded on different environmental strategies:
– Considering the environmental value of this natural area of the Natura 2000 Network SAC Muela de Cortes y El Caroche (ES5233040), and the relevance of this landscape (it has been ranked as Very High Quality, according to the technical assessment of the landscape carried out under PATFOR), it was deemed necessary to restore the area to guaranteeing the conservation status of Habitats of Community Interest.
– For the definition of the objectives of the intervention, active management measures included in the norm of the ZEC Muela de Cortes and El Caroche were considered: B.1 (Forest fire prevention) and B.2 (Sustainable management of forests in the Valencian Hunting Reserve of La Muela de Cortes). Also, the Forest Fire Prevention Plan of the Muela de Cortes Valencian Reserve, as well as the advice of the fire-fighting services and the managers of the Reserve.
– As a result of a participatory process carried out prior to the onset of the restoration project, within the framework of projects TERECOVA and COSTERA (University of Alicante, with support from Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness and Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of the Government of Spain and Regional Development Funds of the EU ERDF, projects CGL2014-52714-C2-1-R and RTI2018-095954-B-I00), the restoration priorities and ecosystem services most valued by the different stakeholder groups were identified. Stakeholders emphasised the importance of giving highest priority to the restoration of key areas to reduce wildfire risk (as estimated by modelling), and areas suffering recurrent fires.
– Generate a mosaic landscape with shrub formations, dry grasslands and grasslands to recover ecological interactions and functionality and protect biodiversity. To guarantee the conservation status of thermo-Mediterranean and pre-steppe scrub (habitat 5330), karst calcareous meadows (habitat 6110) and substeppic areas of grasses and annual plants (habitat 6220), through the improvement of their structure, which should translate into an increase in species diversity, in the mid-term.
– Reduce the continuity of vegetation (fuel) to prevent large fires, increasing the resistance and resilience of the forest mass to wildfires, through the establishment of mosaics of less flammable plant formations, allowing wildfires of lower intensity and propagation speed. These interventions will facilitate fire extinction, while creating safety zones for professional and voluntary fire-fighters.
– Increase ecosystems resilience and resilience to climate change, particularly extreme temperatures, and prolonged and intense drought.
– Increase the extent of suitable habitat for wild herbivores.
– Finally, specific objectives have been established in relation to biodiversity, fire prevention, recovery of agricultural uses and hunting.
As for the reference ecosystems, it is a mosaic of three habitat types: habitat 6220*, grasslands with or without scattered pine and holm oak trees (up to 100 specimens/ha), habitat 6110*, dry grasslands with 60-70% cover and up to 30 cm in height, and habitat 5330, scrub with and without holm oak, Aleppo pine or rodeno pine trees (Pinus halepensis and Pinus pinaster). These habitats develop depending on the type of substrate and the disturbance regime. The mosaic generated is expected to contribute to soil stabilisation and the prevention of erosive processes, the regulation of the hydrological cycle, carbon fixation, nutrient mobilisation, the promotion of biodiversity, pollination, and the proportion of quality grasses for wild ungulates.
The aim is to gradually restore natural ecosystems, considering historical land uses, current population demands, and climate change and wildfire regime scenarios, with the ultimate goal of restoring them completely. The objectives are therefore fully framed in the ecological restoration step of SER restorative continuum.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The action was planned on 972 ha of the ZEC, between the beginning of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, although no action was taken on the entire surface.
Restoration actions included:
– Recovery of abandoned crop fields and establishment of grasslands and pastures: carrying out silvicultural treatments (selecting the main stems in multi-stem oak stumps, thinning, and pruning pines). In old plantations, leaving a final density of 100 trees/ha. Sowing of native forage plants with local certified seeds.
– Modifying forest structure to avoid vertical and horizontal continuity. Thinning and selective clearings of weakened pines and those close to shrub species of interest, until reaching densities adapted to the potential of the area.
– Creation of Strategic Management Zones. Clearing in key areas to modify the most dangerous fuel models and reduce the impact of wildfires.
– Creation of natural corridors. Clearing between the areas managed to favour the transit of large herbivores, the subsequent maintenance of the actions and access to the staff of the Reserve.
Actions had an immediate impact on the landscape and wildfire vulnerability. Medium to long-term effects will be monitored in future years. The design phase of this project was audited, with favourable results, by NEPCON as a pilot project that meets the “WWF Standards for the Certification of Forest Ecosystem Restoration Projects” (2019), a certification system applicable to forest ecosystem restoration projects promoted by WWF Spain with the support of the Biodiversity Foundation.

The implementation phase of the project has been recently audited.
The project Monitoring Plan details a verifier, an indicator and a methodology for each of the specific objectives. Thus, the impact of the proposed restoration actions and the deviations produced will be quantified. Main indicators: number of ha with characteristic species of habitats 6110* and 6220*, area of recovered abandoned fields, fuel models, species richness, contagion rate, probabilistic simulation to check the probability of fires, and forage units.
No long-term management plan has been included. "

These experimental sites include several species-rich field margins established from a regional seed mixture.Background: The historical landscape was composed of a mosaic of various types of habitats. The impact of large-scale and intensive agriculture changed the landscape structure affecting not only the abundance of endangered species but also other species relatively common in the past. Field enlargements and inappropriate management led to the loss in quantity and quality of field margin sites.

Training value: Regular monitoring of the sites allows an assessment of different cutting times on vegetation development since 2010/11. The sites are best practice examples for the promotion of biodiversity in field margins of intensively used agricultural landscapes.Agriculture & Livestock The primary goal was to improve biodiversity and aesthetical value in intensively used agricultural landscapes by providing habitats for higher plants, insects, and other groups of organisms. In addition, they are used in teaching activities as well as in workshops and field trips as best practice examples.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Sowing of a highly diverse seed mixture of wild plants for regional origin is very successful to establish species-rich field margins and flower strips.
Site preparation before sowing of regional seed mixtures is crucial to ensure the establishment of sown target species.
Regular management (mowing and biomass removal) is essential to maintain species richness in the long term.
Mowing in early summer led to a lower grass cover than mowing in September and the flowering aspect of September-mown variants was lower during summer compared to variants mown in May and June.
Precipitation after mowing was decisive for regrowth and in very dry years, mowing in May better ensured flowering aspects in July compared to variants mowing in June. All sites are regularly mown once a year. "

Training value: Regular monitoring of the sites allows to evaluate and recommend appropriate management. The sites represent best practice examples to enhance biodiversity in the urban environment.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The primary goal was to improve the nature conservation potential and aesthetical value of the urban environment. The campus serves to increase the biodiversity of higher plants, insects, and other groups of organisms and creates a resting area for students and university staff. At the same time, it is serving as an example of a highly structured “wilderness” providing habitat for animals and plants, useful for teaching purposes as a best practice, oriented to achieve near-natural restoration of urban sites.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Transferring biomass from well-preserved dry grasslands can be a successful approach for the restoration of psammophytic habitats.
Site preparation of the plots for the sowing of regional seed mixtures is crucial to avoid the expansion of undesirable plant species.
The type of material used for re-grassing (threshed material vs. seed biomass) may influence the success of grassland restoration. The sites are regularly (selectively, mosaic) mown in connection with monitoring. The sand dune is regularly intentionally disturbed, and the woody species and undesirable expansive species are removed to keep the site partly open. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/hjerkinn-pro-restoration-of-a-military-training-area-in-norway-into-a-national-park/	Hjerkinn PRO, restoration of a military training area in Norway into a National Park	Norway	2003-01	2020-08	"The Hjerkinn military training area at Dovrefjell, Norway, used to be the largest military training facility in southern Norway, 165 km2. Soldiers from Norway and allied countries used the area for training and testing of equipment and ammunition until 2008. In 1999 The Norwegian Parliament decided to closed down the existing military training area and an overall goal of  restoring the area. The large scale restoration project started in 2008 and was completed in 2021.The outcome from the restoration is reported according to the overall goal, and four subgoals:
1. Considerable nature benefit, 2. Nature protection, 3. Civilian use, and 4. Restore back to natural state.Restoring the Hjerkinn military training area to natural state has set a standard for ecosystem restoration. Development of technical solutions for high alpine restoation, monitoring, adaptive interventions, and systematic involvement and traning acrtoss professions have been developed and reported in scientific journals, media, and popular reports. The project demonstrates the full cycle of a large-scale restoration and illustrates the diversity of measures, solutions and cooperation needed during such an extensive project.Other The project area used to be a military training area during 100 years. Major parts of the technical infrastructure were developed during the 1960′ s to 1980′ s, including more than 90 km of roads, ~100 buildings and constructions, several large artillery training facilities, gravel pits and mounds. Major parts of roadless areas were also affected from being used for several types of military training and as target areas. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on contemporary reference sites or existing analogues of the pre-degradation ecosystem.The Dovrefjell area is well-documented as a region of significant natural and cultural value. The military area used to be surrounded by many protected areas: National Parks, Nature Reserves and Landscape Protected Areas. Dovrefjell is a high-mountain ecosystem where the wild reindeer is a key species, and the area also hosts populations of wolverine, arctic foxes,
golden eagles, gyrfalcons and other rare and threatened animal species, a high number of rare and red-listed plant species and a large diversity of vegetation types. Main vegetation types include lichen heaths and shrub heaths, mires as well as alpine meadows and snow beds. Dovrefjell holds the only European population of musk oxen, which was introduced from Greenland in the 1950′ s and remains highly attractive for recreation and tourism. 1. Considerable nature benefit,
2. Nature protection,
3. Civilian use,
4. Restore back to natural state.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: The military activity was closed down between 2003 and 2008 How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: Removing existing military infrastructure and polluted soil How this project achieved a desirable species composition: The following guidlines were used to guide the entire project and prepare for  ecosystem recovery, including species composition, structural diversity, functionality, and  exchange with surrinding landscape: 1. Acknowledge ecological processes, 2. avoid new disturbance during the implementation, 3. no use of introduced species, 4. time scale – consider both short and long term effects, 5. spatial scale (integrate small and large scale perspectives). How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): The following guidlines were used to guide the entire project and prepare for  ecosystem recovery, including species composition, structural diversity, functionality, and  exchange with surrinding landscape: 1. Acknowledge ecological processes, 2. avoid new disturbance during the implementation, 3. no use of introduced species, 4. time scale – consider both short and long term effects, 5. spatial scale (integrate small and large scale perspectives). How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): The following guidlines were used to guide the entire project and prepare for  ecosystem recovery, including species composition, structural diversity, functionality, and  exchange with surrinding landscape: 1. Acknowledge ecological processes, 2. avoid new disturbance during the implementation, 3. no use of introduced species, 4. time scale – consider both short and long term effects, 5. spatial scale (integrate small and large scale perspectives). How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): The following guidlines were used to guide the entire project and prepare for  ecosystem recovery, including species composition, structural diversity, functionality, and  exchange with surrinding landscape: 1. Acknowledge ecological processes, 2. avoid new disturbance during the implementation, 3. no use of introduced species, 4. time scale – consider both short and long term effects, 5. spatial scale (integrate small and large scale perspectives). Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: Meetings with stakeholders, information letters to all local inhabitants, guided tours in the area, green training of project owner and contractors by trained ecologists. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: No military activity after 2008 Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: In total 80.5 km of roads were removed, and the restored area amounted to 5.2 km2. More than 120 subterrain tubes were removed to restore natural hydrology systems. Additionally 80 buildings and 8 bridges were demolished and recycled. As roads and technical infrastructure were removed, the interference-free area, located greater than 1 km from heavy infrastructure, more than doubled, from 51 km2 to 114 km2.
More than 15,000 soldiers searched the entire area on foot, more than 19,000 UXOs were found and destroyed, and 550 tons of metal trash were removed. Achieve a desirable species composition: The restoration measures have a documented effect on the recovery of native species and vegetation communities. Reinstate structural diversity: The restored area of 5.2 km2 consisted mainly of lichen heaths and shrub heath, with some wetlands and mires. The newly restored landscape is capable of storing an estimated 54,500 t carbon, with the additional sequestration of over 1,800 t carbon per year from net primary productivity. Recover ecosystem functionality: Road removal also increased available habitat for wild reindeer. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: In 2018, major parts (130 km2) of the former military area was protected as National Park and Landscape Protected Area. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The natural recovery is very slow in northern high altitudes, and full recovery of native vegetation types is still going on.
Some technical infrastructure was so devastating to local landscape features, soil and geomorphology, and will never be fully recovered.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The restored area is a wilderness area with no permanent settlement. The restored area will support the income for local households within the tourist industry and local farmers, however quantification as household resilience or income has yet to be uncovered.
Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: The newly restored landscape as a climax community, is capable of storing an estimated 54,500 t C, with the additional sequestration of over 1,800 t C yr-1 from net primary productivity. The restoration has contributed to the restoration of sound and wellfunctioning alpine habitats. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: Overall the project was wanted, and the safety in the area and the large wilderness values was highly appreciated. Removing the  previous military roads, also used as access roads to the inner mountain areas, raised conflicts during the project. The Parliament decided to reformulate the original goal of removing all infrastructure, and some of the roads in the mountains are kept with stronly regulated access. Methods and solutions have been tested, evaluated, researched and adapted, both
scientifically and practically. Many of the restoration measures and experiences have been
reported and published in MSc and PhD theses and scientific papers. Procedures from
Hjerkinn PRO, both “Green training” courses and restoration methods are transferable to
many other types of restoration projects. • Another key lesson from the project was the cooperation/
integration that linked the practical knowledge from activities on the ground, with
scientific knowledge and research. The value of understanding between professions and
communicate on a common platform is great for achieving the desired quality, reaching
deadlines and a sensible financial implementation. • Having ambitious goals is vital, but
defining measurable sub-goals is even more important to verify that the project has the
desired effect upon completion. • Hjerkinn PRO established five restoration principles that
proved very important as guidelines in the on-going work. • Restoration represents
prioritation of land use, and conflicts might rise about extent and forms of restoration. It is
important for a successful outcome that the conflicts are handled in a respectable and
orderly manner. • A measure for good dialogue and progress was a very open
communication with all interest groups, including the media, and by involving both
stakeholders and authorities in important processes. This turned out to be a valuable
experience to be shared across countries, ecosystems and degradation stages. Main parts of the area is protected as National Park with a board. The Norwegian Environmental Agency is the national management authority. Part of the area is grazed by domestic sheep farmers. Wild reindeer is hunted, based on strong regulations. Access to a tourist cabin /hotel is by a dedicated bus during summer season. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/kenilworth-marsh-tidal-wetland-restoration-washington-d-c/	Kenilworth Marsh Tidal Wetland Restoration, Washington D.C.	United States of America	1989	1993	"The Kenilworth Marsh tidal wetland restoration project is located in Washington, District of Columbia, United States. The goal of the project was to restore areas degraded from a suite of long-term impacts including river sedimentation, contamination, and channelization. Besides the impacts of altered hydrology on the wetlands, original site substrates and vegetation were buried under dredge spoils and covered with a landfill. Work began with a review of historical changes to the site, assessment of reference conditions, and identification of key factors that restricted the recovery of the wetland. Managers then initiated a pilot study to understand optimal substrate elevations, plant species, and tidal hydrology for facilitating the restoration of the marsh. In the fall of 1992, 130,000 cubic yards of dredged material were used to fill areas in accordance with restoration design elevations. For nearly five months the newly formed marsh substrate was left fallow to allow for dewatering and settlement. At the same time, hydraulically designed tidal channels were cut into the substrate to restore tidal flow back to the system. The following spring, more than 350,000 native plants were installed.Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological), Dams & Hydrology, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry, Other Kenilworth Marsh was dredged to create a tidal lagoon connected to the Anacostia River between the 1930’s-1940’s. Around the same time spoils from the dredging of the Anacostia River were placed in Kenilworth Marsh, filling in open water and covering native vegetation. A solid waste landfill also operated in the vicinity of the marsh until 1970. Due to the above-listed disturbances, invasive plant species colonized the marsh leading to further loss of native vegetation and wildlife habitat. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on historical information about ecological attributes at the site prior to degradation.Prior to conducting full scale restoration efforts the project team reviewed historic documents and aerial imagery to determine what previous vegetation and hydrologic features covered Kenilworth Marsh. Subsequently, a pilot project was designed and implemented to test the performance of different plant mixes and containment structures. Main ecological goals:
Alter species composition (plant, animal, and undesired species)
Increase structural diversity (vegetation, trophic levels, spatial mosaic)
Improve ecosystem function (productivity, habitat, resilience)
Increase external exchanges (habitat links, gene flow, landscape flows)
Remove threats (contamination, invasive species, over-utilization)
Improve physical conditions (substrate physical, substrate chemical, water chemo-physical)
Main social goals:
Enhance community wellbeing
Increase stakeholder awareness and engagement
Knowledge enrichment
Restore natural capital
 
 

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Stakeholders that were engaged included: local community and project neighbours, nonprofit citizen groups, citizen scientists, land managers, government, and youth. They were engaged to help prioritize distribution of restoration actions on the landscape, help set project goals, objectives, targets, and vision, contribute knowledge on methods and implementation, contribute knowledge about ecological conditions and successional patterns, and engage in participatory monitoring.
The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments: brought together multitude of agencies to plan restoration priorities, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: provided funding & scientific guidance, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: provided funding & scientific guidance, and the United States Geological Survey: conducted monitoring & scientific guidance.

How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Placement of dredged material to recontour the site to allow for the restoration of the marsh’s hydraulic function 
Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: The dredging and recontouring of the site reconnected the natural hydrology of the site. Achieve a desirable species composition: Overall, Kenilworth Marsh revegetated extensively and vigorously. During the first year, at least 90% of revegetation areas were covered with dense plant growth averaging several feet in height. Recover ecosystem functionality: The restoration also has led to the recolonization of the site with wildlife (particularly bird) species that had not been seen in the area since dredging and landfill activities began.
Monitoring has not shown a significant improvement in water quality. This is likely due to the overwhelming tidal influence of the adjacent Anacostia River, which remains contaminated with pollutants. To increase the effectiveness of the freshwater tidal marsh in improving water quality throughout the Anacostia watershed, more acres of wetland restoration are necessary. One objective of monitoring was to determine if reconstruction of the wetlands had a detectable effect or impact on the water quality of the marsh system and possibly even the nearby Anacostia during the five-year post-reconstruction period. Water quality at Kenilworth Marsh was measured and analyzed for differences and trends within the marsh for five years after the marsh was reconstructed (1993-97), for changes in relation to the adjacent Anacostia mainstem (as a control) for this same five-year period. and for changes in relation to the mainstem and pre-marsh (then consisting of open water tidal flats) for the five-year pre-reconstruction period (1988-92). This data set was intended to serve as a reference for the study sites and study time frame.
In addition to water quality monitoring following the reconstruction, a 5-year monitoring program (begun in 1993) was established to look at the effectiveness of wetland vegetation reestablishment, plant biodiversity, wildlife (including plankton, aquatic macro-invertebrates, mammals, birds, and fish) productivity and utilization, the stability of sediment and development of soil and hydrologic patterns, and nutrient reduction. Management activities since the reconstruction have mainly consisted of removal of invasive plants, particularly purple loosestrife and phragmites. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/early-tallgrass-prairie-restoration-at-homestead-national-historical-park/	Early Tallgrass Prairie Restoration at Homestead National Historical Park	United States of America	1940s	continuous monitoring/maintenance	"Homestead National Historical Park (formerly Homestead National Monument of America) in southeastern Nebraska was established in 1936 at the site of Daniel Freeman’s original homestead from 1863. Encompassing 100 acres of tallgrass prairie that had been converted into agricultural land and 60 acres of woodland fringing a creek, the monument underwent restoration by the National Park Service in 1939 in an attempt to restore the prairie that Freeman would have discovered upon his arrival at the site. Ongoing for more than 75 years, the Homestead restoration is the nation’s second oldest tallgrass prairie restoration project. Restoration efforts currently involve periodic burning and removal of invasive plant species. Recent National Park Service monitoring activities documented that the restored Homestead Prairie exhibits the species diversity and distribution characteristic of a functioning native prairie.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) When Homestead National Historical Park was established by Congress in 1936, the upland slopes of the site were severely eroded, the lower slopes were covered with heavy depositions of silt, and the woodlands had been logged and heavily grazed. At least 40 acres of the site were under agriculture cultivation until 1939. Current threats to the park are mainly attributed to invasive species, altered fire and grazing regimes, edge effects (from being a small, protected area surrounded by agriculture) and climate change.

These stakeholders helped prioritize distribution of restoration actions on the landscape, helped set project goals, objectives, targets, or vision, contributed knowledge on methods or implementation, contributed knowledge about ecological conditions or successional patterns, and engaged in participatory monitoring. For more recent restoration activities Tribes have been consulted. Microsoft Word – adhi.docx (npshistory.com): http://npshistory.com/publications/home/adhi-2020.pdf

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Invasive species: 1943- Weed control was implemented; sunflowers were mowed, and bindweed was treated with sodium chlorate. 1955- Smooth bromegrass infestation was noted. 1963- 2,4-D was used for weed control. 1964- Lowlands were heavily infested with weeds. Dalapon was used for smooth brome control and 2,4-D was applied for broadleaf weed control. 1968- Smooth brome was mowed. 1979- Woody plants were sprayed with ammonium sulfamate; routine 2,4-D spraying program stopped. 1984- Weedy lowland area was mowed. Currently, the park monitors for nonnative species in the prairie and woodland areas of the monument and uses a combination of techniques, including mowing, selective use of herbicides, and prescribed fire, to manage these areas.
Agricultural & Livestock: Livestock access to the site has been managed by the park throughout the project. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: 1942- Additional seeding and sodding occurred, along with the construction of small check dams to slow erosion. 1947- Sodding occurred in upland gullies; seeding and local prairie hay mulch was used in eroding areas How this project achieved a desirable species composition: 1939- Park records indicate that the first seeding took place in 1939 with seed gathered from a prairie located approximately 5 miles to the west. The approximate seed mixture was 45% big bluestem, 50% little bluestem, and 1% each of Kentucky bluegrass, needle and thread grass, indiangrass, prairie dropseed, and sideoats grama. This original restoration also included the installation of native plant plugs and the transplantation of sod from nearby areas of un-ploughed prairie in an attempt to control severe sheet, rill, and gully erosion on the coarse-textured south upland slopes. The source of the sod is unknown. 1942- Additional seeding and sodding occurred, along with the construction of small check dams to slow erosion. 1943- Weed control was implemented; sunflowers were mowed, and bindweed was treated with sodium chlorate. 1948- Additional spot seeding occurred; sod was added to the uplands; selective grazing was suggested as a means of reducing fire hazard. 1949- First use of herbicide other than sodium chlorate (2,4-D). 1951- 40 acres were mowed. 1952- Upland areas were hayed. 1953- Bottomland areas were hayed. 1954- Native seeds were harvested. 1955- Smooth bromegrass infestation was noted. 1963- 2,4-D was used for weed control. 1959- First Vegetation Management Plan was drafted to guide future actions (e.g., mowing, reseeding, planting, burning, weed control) at the park in the ongoing effort to recreate the natural setting of the 1860s. 1964- Lowlands were heavily infested with weeds. Dalapon was used for smooth brome control and 2,4-D was applied for broadleaf weed control. 1965- Thatch buildup leads to complete mowing of the site. 1968- Smooth brome was mowed. 1969- 7-11 acres of lowland were seeded. 1970- First prescribed burn to manage the prairie; 2,4-D was applied. 1976- 4 acres of lowland areas were reseeded. 1979- Woody plants were sprayed with ammonium sulfamate; routine 2,4-D spraying program stopped. 1980- 17-acre wildfire occurred. 1982- Quantitative vegetative sampling began; prescribed burn was implemented in April (8 acres); manual removal of musk thistles and common mullein. 1983- Entire prairie was burned, 4 acres of weedy lowland were mowed. 1984- Weedy lowland area was mowed; fall burn of small overgrown sumac implemented; herbarium was assembled; local native seed and sod was collected. 1986- Lowland area sodded and planted with approximately 3,000 greenhouse grown seedlings from locally collected prairie seed. Prescribed burning began in 1970. The prairie is divided into six management units and burned on a seven-year cycle. Every year, two units are randomly chosen for treatment, with the stipulation that once a unit has been burned twice in the seven-year period, it is removed from consideration for the duration of that period. Seasonality of fires is also randomized. The seventh year is a “rest year”. The goals of the fire management program are control of invasive nonnative species such as smooth brome, management of shrub species to no more than 15% of the prairie by area, and removal of plant debris that, if left in place, creates the potential for a large, devastating fire. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): This was addressed by reintroducing a prescribed burning cycle. 1968- Smooth brome was mowed. 1979- Woody plants were sprayed with ammonium sulfamate; routine 2,4-D spraying program stopped. 1980- 17-acre wildfire occurred. 1982- Quantitative vegetative sampling began; prescribed burn was implemented in April (8 acres); manual removal of musk thistles and common mullein. 1983- Entire prairie was burned, 4 acres of weedy lowland were mowed. 1984- Weedy lowland area was mowed; fall burn of small overgrown sumac implemented; herbarium was assembled; local native seed and sod was collected. Prescribed burning began in 1970. The prairie is divided into six management units and burned on a seven-year cycle.

How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): This was addressed by reintroducing a prescribed burning cycle. 1968- Smooth brome was mowed. 1979- Woody plants were sprayed with ammonium sulfamate; routine 2,4-D spraying program stopped. 1980- 17-acre wildfire occurred. 1982- Quantitative vegetative sampling began; prescribed burn was implemented in April (8 acres); manual removal of musk thistles and common mullein. 1983- Entire prairie was burned, 4 acres of weedy lowland were mowed. 1984- Weedy lowland area was mowed; fall burn of small overgrown sumac implemented; herbarium was assembled; local native seed and sod was collected.

Achieve a desirable species composition: Today, the species composition of the tallgrass prairie at Homestead resembles that of pre-settlement times. In fact, plant diversity is greater in the oldest sections of the restored prairie than in some native prairie remnants in the area. There are 116 plant species present at the site, and dominant species include big bluestem, little bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass, goldenrod, field pussytoes, and leadplant. Interspersed within the prairie are thickets of shrubby species such as sumac, wild plum, and dogwood, which provide habitat for birds and other small animals. A 2007 National Park Service report presented the findings of sampling exercises conducted at monitoring sites between 1998 and 2006. Based on the data collected at these sites, it was concluded that the 100 acres of restored prairie at Homestead National Monument reflect the species richness and diversity of the prairie's historic source and native species augmentation. It is a species-rich plant community with a distribution pattern composed of core and satellite species. Although it is difficult to make a quantitative comparison of the restored prairie with a mid-1860s prairie, the diversity and distribution of species reflects a functioning native prairie. Reinstate structural diversity: Dominant species now include big bluestem, little bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass, goldenrod, field pussytoes, and leadplant. Interspersed within the prairie are thickets of shrubby species such as sumac, wild plum, and dogwood.
Since the establishment of Homestead National Historical Park, many different invasive plant species have colonized the site. The species have required different methods of treatment, including changes in herbicides utilized as some toxic chemicals were phased out over time. Managers have also fine tuned the use and timing of fire and mowing on the landscape to achieve restoration goals. Monitoring has been done on plant composition/species cover, erosion, and effects of burning, invasive plant removal, and seeding/planting operations. Results from monitoring have been used throughout the many years of restoration activities to adapt and plan for future seeding, planting, sod installation, burning operations, and invasive plant control.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/pecos-national-historical-park-glorieta-creek-wetland-riparian-restoration/	Pecos National Historical Park Glorieta Creek Wetland-Riparian Restoration	United States of America	1999	2016	"This project was focused on restoring the floodplain and terraces along Glorieta Creek within Pecos National Historical Park (NHP), which is located in northern New Mexico (United States) near the town of Pecos. Pecos NHP is near the intersection of the Rocky Mountains, Great Plains, and Sonoran Desert physiographic provinces at an elevation of approximately 7000 feet. The project encompassed a half-mile stretch of floodplain and terraces along lower Glorieta Creek, which was mined for sand and gravel before becoming part of the park. Once mining ended in the mid-1980s, ranchers bulldozed the remaining material into levees and created two reservoirs, further degrading the hydrological and ecosystem functions of the area. The main goal of the project was to restore hydrological function by removing the levees and reservoirs and recontouring the creek channel. Starting in 1999 the National Park Service and its partners removed fill and parts of the levee. They also and completed a number of restoration actions including planting trees and native grasses. The project resulted in improved hydrologic functioning of the creek and a thriving native riparian plant community that was healthy until the recent long-term drought within the region.Dams & Hydrology, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Mining & Resource Extraction, Other This area of Glorieta Creek was mined for sand and gravel before becoming part of Pecos National Historic Park. Once mining ended in the mid-1980s, ranchers bulldozed the remaining spoils material into levees and created two reservoirs on 5.6 acres. The reservoirs soon became a threat to the hydrologic functionality of Glorieta Creek. Floodwaters periodically swept thousands of fish from the creek into the reservoirs, where they were trapped and later died as the ponds dried. Flooding also caused breaches in the progressively weakening levees, washing sediment into the creek and toward the Pecos River approximately 0.5 mile downstream. Due to mining, ranching, and erosion disturbances, invasive plant species had colonized the degraded areas leading to a loss of native vegetation and wildlife habitat. The main threats included erosion, flooding, loss of wildlife/plant habitat, invasive species, and degraded water quality. The project area was experiencing erosion of the levees, leading to flooding and water quality degradation. Flooding and erosion were reducing native vegetation cover while increasing invasive plant cover, as well as driving mortality events in which aquatic wildlife species became trapped and died in flooder reservoirs that later dried up. This section of Glorieta Creek was degraded due to issues with damming of the creek channel, erosion, flooding, loss of native vegetation, and spread of invasive species. The area was experiencing a loss of structural diversity, driven by a loss of native vegetation due to flooding, erosion, and invasive species colonization. Due to the levees and reservoirs placed in the creek channel, external exchanges were limited. The project’s primary goals are to improve hydrological function of this stretch of Glorieta Creek – by connecting segmented or blocked sections of the creek – and restore the disturbed areas to native riparian plant communities that can also support birds and other faunal populations that depend on riparian habitat.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Consultation with the parks traditionally associated Tribes was completed throughout the project. Other stakeholders included nonprofit citizen groups, government, and youth who contributed knowledge on methods, implementation, and ecological conditions and successional patterns.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: The main threats included erosion, flooding, loss of wildlife/plant habitat, invasive species, and degraded water quality. This was addressed by excavating soil from levees and reservoirs to recontour the site to allow the restoration of the creek's hydraulic function and by planting native riparian/wetland species across the disturbed areas to restore biodiversity and improve habitat How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: The project area was experiencing erosion of the levees, leading to flooding and water quality degradation. This was addressed by excavating soil from levees and reservoirs to recontour the site and restore the hydraulic function. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Flooding and erosion were reducing native vegetation cover, while increasing invasive plant cover. Aquatic wildlife species were also being killed due to flooding/erosion and subsequent drying of reservoirs where they were trapped. This was addressed by excavating soil from levees and reservoirs to recontour the site as we as by planting native riparian/wetland species across the disturbed areas. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): The area was experiencing a loss of structural diversity as native vegetation was lost due to flooding, erosion, and invasive species colonization. This was addressed by installing native riparian/wetland species across the disturbed areas to restore structural diversity. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): This section of Glorieta Creek was degraded due to issues with damming the creek channel, erosion, flooding, loss of native vegetation, and invasive species. This was addressed by reintroducing native riparian/wetland species and using soil from levees and reservoirs to recontour the physical structure of the site. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Due to the levees and reservoirs placed in the creek channel external exchanges were limited. These exchanges were reestablished by excavating the soil from the levees and reservoirs, and recontouring the site in order to rebuild the hydraulic function. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Improving the hydrologic function and reintroducing riparian species has eliminated some of the threats to the ecosystem. Drought has continued to be a threat and has caused setbacks in native plant survival and cover, which in turn has negatively impacted wildlife habitat and forage. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: Physical conditions were successfully reinstated Achieve a desirable species composition: This has largely been successful, with the introduction of riparian species. Drought has led to setback in native plant survival. Reinstate structural diversity: This has largely been successful, with the introduction of riparian species. Drought has led to setback in native plant survival. Recover ecosystem functionality: This has largely been successful, with the improvement of hydrologic function and introduction of riparian species. Drought has led to setback in native plant survival and cover, which has negatively impacted wildlife habitat and forage. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: External exchanges have been reestablished with the renewal of functional hydrology. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Drought continues to limit the recovery of this ecosystem.
Multiple lessons were learned through this project, the first of which was the realization that a portion of the upper levee along Glorieta Creek needed to be left in place to protect the newly excavated and planted site from flood erosion until soil-stabilizing vegetation could take hold. In 2007, it was determined that sufficient plant establishment had occurred to allow the removal of the remaining levee segment separating Glorieta Creek from the adjacent, restored floodplain. This provided an opportunity to fully restore natural channel-floodplain processes and functions. The establishment of the plant community also decreased the ongoing threat of levee erosion during floods, which could result in massive sediment deposition into the restored wetland-riparian area, Glorieta Creek, and the Pecos Wild and Scenic River immediately downstream. A second challenge was severe, multiyear drought that had an impact on seeding and planting survival, as well as water levels. Observations showed extensive damage and mortality to previously outplanted cottonwoods and willows during this time. These observations resulted in the decision to delay additional plantings until soil moisture conditions were adequate to support plant growth and establishment. Monitoring for this project included periodic site reviews of how the restoration efforts were performing. These reviews led to adaptive management in the form of phasing levee removal until plants were well established and holding over plantings until drought conditions lessened. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/first-successful-mountain-forest-restoration-in-central-argentina-25-years-later/	First successful mountain forest restoration in central Argentina 25 years later	Argentina	1997-05	2027-05	"The high mountains of central Argentina are losing their soils due to livestock, fires, trampling by vehicles and trekkers, in combination with a reduced forest cover, cold temperatures, a long dry season and heavy rains. With the goal of restoring a portion of forest and reducing soil erosion, in 1997 I selected a 22 ha site devoid of forest and where 30% of the soil surface was lost. The “Quebrada de los Refugios” is near my home town and land owners were in agreement. With volunteer help we built fences to exclude livestock, planted 20000 native trees, and to reduce soil erosion we covered bare soil with native tussocks in 30 erosion gullies. The trees prospered to form a beautiful 25 year old forest stand. Recent studies comparing the restoration area with control and reference areas show important restoration progress in bird, fungi and liken forest communities. More evaluations are needed. We also need to work on 15 remaining active gullies to further reduce soil erosion, on maintenance of fences and trekking trails, and to continue with the control of incipient biological invasions by non-native plants. Twelve similar projects are now being carried out in the region. Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fire & Weather Events The high mountains of central Argentina are losing their soils at an alarming rate and already 20% of the land cover is composed of exposed rock where soils were present in the past. Gullies produced by water erosion are abundant and can reach a depth of over 4 m. The lack of an adequate vegetation cover, trampling by livestock, vehicles and trekkers, in combination with a long dry season, heavy monsoon rains and a cold climate have accelerated soil loss. Due to the high altitude climate and steep slopes, the mountain range is a fragile ecosystem and if current rates of disturbances are not reduced, the area could be converted into a rock desert. 
 The effects of forest and soil loss on ecosystem function has been poorly studied in the mountains of central Argentina and with mixed evidences, though most consequences are negative there are always some benefits.  Native Polylepis trees planted in areas where the topsoil has been partially lost grow about 50% slower than trees planted in well preserved soils suggesting degradation reduces ecosystem recovery. Forests have a unique biodiversity so further reductions in their extension would decrease landscape biodiversity. Older successional forest stages have increasing richness of wood decaying fungi including several species unique to the only known old growth forest found to date. The loss of this unique old growth stand will presumably mean species extinctions. Other ecosystem attributes do not seem to be affected by degradation. For example, soil mycorrhiza biodiversity and inoculation capacity is not lost even with extreme soil degradation, nor is plant richness lost with heavy grazing pressure and the expansion of bare rock due to soil loss. 
 I have not found studies on socio-economic and political factors contributing to degradation in the mountains of central Argentina. The existence of many abandoned houses and records of an order of magnitude more livestock existing in the mountains of central Argentina a century ago as compared to present day, suggests a net human emigration from the area and lower livestock productivity due in part to soil loss and degradation.  The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Simulations suggest that around 50% of the high mountains of central Argentina could be covered by Polylepis forests if all the area would have been under a history of low livestock pressure, such as in sites far away from human settlements and roads. As forests currently occupy 12% of the mountains, forest expansion is a priority restoration goal. While most remaining forests are highly degraded or in regeneration stage, in our best-preserved forest areas we find regenerating, young, and mature forests in similar proportions. As our project site is only 22 ha, I believe the restored site should be conceptualized as a forest stand which has to be helped into a trajectory leading to the different forest successional stages and that with 25 yrs the restored forest stand should be ending the regeneration stage and entering the young forest stage. No studies exist on reference forest function and biodiversity at the regeneration and young forest stage so these studies should be performed before a good evaluation of restoration success can be done. These evaluations are complicated by the fact that to the best of my knowledge no unaltered reference forests exist in the area but good approximations might be possible.  1. Expand forest area and reduce soil erosion.
2. Determine the best methods to restore high mountain forests.
3. Provide a first successful forest restoration for Argentina to be used as an inspiring model.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The three primary stakeholders are the land owners; a family living in the city and two mountaineering clubs. I contacted them to get permission and got much volunteer help from the two mountaineering clubs. Other stakeholders were the neighboring ranchers which used the project site as a pasture for cattle and sheep. I visited all of them and informed them on my intentions, and asked for their advise. I learned that they were very knowledgeable in management of livestock and (of course) no experience in restoration ecology. 
 I tried involving stakeholders in the planning process but at the time I had no experience in forest restoration myself and was learning from observation, from doing and from the very little literature that I could get hold of in 1997. I did not even know the words “ecological restoration” existed.  Stakeholders interests where very different to mine and to the ecological restoration concept. And I soon gave up engaging any stakeholder in the planning process. 
 I kept stakeholders informed by personal visits, reports, conferences, articles in the newspaper, radio and TV, and in the last decade through the internet – mailing and more resently through the social media. In Argentina people that live in far of mountains with no roads are very well communicated through the internet and social media. In a educational project we gave classes for over 2 years in all 7 schools situated in the high mountains of Córdoba. In my opinion, the most effective educational and outreach strategy was to do much of the restoration work with local volunteers, albeit important aspects of restoration cannot be learned only as a volunteer. In 2017 we colleagues from the ONG Ecosistemas argentinos and the University we created a school for ecological restoration. 

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: As livestock was the main threat to the high-mountain forest regeneration, we built and maintained fences to exclude livestock. With the passing years and build up of dry biomass, fires became a new threat, especially during the dry season. For this we put up signposts where we indicate the prohibition of igniting fires (mainly camp-fires) and talked to campers explaining why it was important that no fires were used in the area. To avoid invasions by non-native species we pulled them out or cut them when seen and special rounds are performed to find them and keep their cover at a minimum. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: We performed only minor activities to restore physical conditions as lost soils were to expensive (and in my opinion controversial) to reinstate and I gave priority to reducing ongoing soil erosion by building up a good vegetation cover. When time and resources were available, at planting we dealt with compacted soils by digging 40 cm or deeper holes to plant the trees and then filling in the deeper part of the hole with loose soil. When the organic topsoil had been lost we also sometimes added inorganic fertilizer (NPK) which under those conditions triples tree growth. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: I used the strategy of planting the dominant native forest species – Polylepis australis – which is a pioneer species of very poor dispersal, and hoped that these plantations in combination with reduction of disturbance would facilitate the re-establishment of most other desired species. Formal studies evaluating what forest plant species have not re-established naturally have to be performed yet, and if necessary missing plants (and eventually other taxa) maybe re-introduced. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Within the 22 ha restored forest stand I mimicked a simultaneous post-disturbance forest regeneration by planting most of the area within three years. No tree reposition was performed, thus sites where trees did not prosper remained treeless, creating a mosaic of forests, grasslands and rock. At a landscape scale, structural diversity was reinstated in part because the 22 ha project site is a forest island within a degraded grassland and rock matrix. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): I mainly prescribed a natural recovery of ecosystem functionality. In the most degraded soils where organic topsoil had been lost, we used fertilizers as an input (inorganic NPK – 5 kg in all) to boost tree growth. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): I did not contemplate this aspect so far. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: For two years we intensively visited and gave classes in all the high-mountain schools of the region which were seven at that time. Perhaps more influential, during the 25 years of the project I involved over a thousand local volunteers in restoration work, mainly from the nearby cities and towns. In year 2022 there are now 12 other similar restoration projects which are being funded in the high-mountains of central Argentina. To me it is noteworthy that most present day project leaders were at sometime volunteers of the first restoration area in “Quebrada de los Refugios”, and got some or all their funding with my help. Thus, to me it seems that most socio-economic changes produced by the project were mainly through learning as volunteers, in the same way I learned the basics of managing a project as a  volunteer during my work at projects based in USA and Peru. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: So far the threats of livestock and fires have been successfully reduced from the restored site. During the first 5 years livestock continued entering the restoration site due to problems of bad fencing, people who cut the fences, or goats which jumped through. However, we always chased out the livestock within the first few  days after they had entered and we attempted to solve each of the problems which caused the livestock to enter. After year 5 we had no more livestock entering the restoration site. Problems in the fencing were mainly due to soil loss under the fences producing passages for livestock – especially young cattle and sheep, due to people cutting fences with the argument that they were unnatural to the area, and due to the extreme climbing abilities of goats which were thankfully sold out by their owner, in contribution to the restoration project. To date only one wildfire affected a small portion of the restored area and was quickly put out by a group of volunteers which had stayed “after hours” during a plantation day, while nowadays illegal use of camp-fires is much reduced. Instead, I consider that the threat of invasions by non-native species is low, but increasing. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: Some of the originally lost soils are being recovered at the restoration area, mainly due to soil loss in up-slope sites out of the restoration area. Most of this soil “recovery” does not cover surfaces where the original soils were lost, however, a small part does and I believe it is having a good impact on water retention (personal observations). Another physical condition which is being recovered is the soil porosity at the superficial lever (up to 15 cm deep). Achieve a desirable species composition: Formal studies were conducted on bird, fungi and liken communities comparing control, restoration and reference sites. The consensus is that the restored forest site is changing in the right trajectory and losing species associated to grasslands and acquiring more forest species. I find it important to mention that augmenting species richness in the restored area was never a restoration goal. The goal is to restore the forest community including its unique species – which can have higher, equal or lower species richness than the control and reference sites. I am not in agreement at how the global scientific community is evaluating “restoration projects” mostly using “species richness” at a local scale as an indicator of success. Reinstate structural diversity: No formal studies, but structural diversity and spatial habitat diversity is certainly reinstated as can be seen in the before and after photos, or visually comparing control, restored and reference areas. As formal studies show that the forest bird community is returning to the restored area, it could be hypothesized that faunal food webs have been or are in the process of being restored – this could be an interesting topic for a future evaluation. Recover ecosystem functionality: Unknown, this has not been evaluated and of course this could be an interesting topic for a future evaluation. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: For the past 12 years I have been evaluating dry season water yield in the restored forest site and in an untreated control site with ongoing degradation. A preliminary analysis suggests there are no costs in terms of water yield due to restored forest cover, with a tendency of a three year improved water yield after a especially rainy season which could be due to improved water retention capacity in the restored forest area (but alternative hypothesis could be true). Given I have no pre-project data on water yield and given the big annual fluctuations in the relative water yields of both studied basins (partially restored and control), many more years of monitoring will be needed. No monitoring of migration or gene flow to date. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Even when disturbances are reduced, natural forest recover is limited due to low seed dispersal of the structuring Polylepis tree species of the area. When planted at the  higher elevations and under good livestock exclosures, wind exposure and soil degradation reduces Polylepis growth and presumably forest recovery but does not limit the recovery. When planted at lower elevations leaf cutting ants become a serious limiting factor. The most limiting socio-economic factors in my opinion are two: (1) the scarce amount of qualified restoration leaders. (2) The permanent underestimation of restoration costs as perceived by donors, society and even by restoration leaders themselves. In my experience, the underestimation of restoration costs creates conditions where restoration leathers interested in creating a forest are frustrated because there goals are very hard to meet with the available funding. Instead, increasing funds are going to people which are in good faith excellent managers of massive and popular plantations which are nice food for the livestock industry which does not allow natural forest regeneration in the first place. In the high-mountains of central Argentina, planting without livestock exclusion makes no sense.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: In the short term (i.e. 10 yrs) the 22 ha forest restoration project mainly benefited the family living at the trail base leading the the project site through increases in sails at their family restaurant. Volunteers, an increasing assistance of trekkers and myself are their best clients. In the longer term (starting from yr 12) a project volunteer got funding to start a new restoration site, and this process has been increasing in number of new project leaders, increasing in funding income for native tree plantation. Funding to the region is presently at around u$a 250000 per year and involves hiring local ranchers for tree plantations.  There is an incipient tourist industry where people pay to plant thus helping with work and with funding, a portion of which is reaching local guides.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: Regarding water, reducing soil erosion in the restoration area also involves a reduction in the rate at which the rain water holding capacity of the area was being lost. This said, it is unclear whether the restored forest with hold soils in place at a cost in water yield due to tree evapotranspiration, or whether increased fog capture and water holding capacity due to soil increased infiltration rate will compensate for evapotranspiration. To the best of my knowledge no studies to date report on these aspects of forest restoration at sites similar to ours in climate and using native tree species, even when most mountain restoration programs argue their main benefits are increasing water yield. The restoration does not provide timber, fiber or fuel even when this could be feasible and perhaps desirable. The local government prohibits the use of native plants in the high mountains of Central Argentina – thus legislation would have to be changed before a use of these resources can be made effective. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: The 22 ha restored mountain forest area is part of my culture since we have grown together and I have spent over 800 days working and enjoying the area. Many of those days at the restoration site were shared with my wife, children, colleagues and volunteers. To me it is a very beautiful place. Surely, many more people have a similar opinion. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: No formal studies, but surely a restored forest is more desirable than a degraded grassland slowly becoming a rock desert at regulating the climate, floods, soil erosion and water quality. Regarding diseases, here I am not so sure and there might be compromises. On one hand, increases in water quality are evident especially after livestock exclusion and this should reduce stomach diseases in trekkers and campers visiting the area. On the other hand, with increasing habitat structural complexity there have been increases in mice densities, and some people have expressed their concerns that this could augment  diseases. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: One neighboring rancher has complained that the Puma or mountain lion (Puma concolor) sometimes hides within the restored forest to predate his sheep. I have also received complaints from mountaineers because of the invasive species control activities which negatively affect their cultural values, especially control of exotic Oak and Pine trees. Do not use non-native species. Initially I planted a few non-native trees to provide quick shading and fuel wood, in retrospect this was a big mistake. By year 10 they started to produce seeds and they were time consuming to eradicate as their seedlings kept appearing from the seed bank years after cutting the originally planted trees. Moreover, shading was eventually provided by the native trees, and to reduce wildfires the local government banned the use of camp-fires, so planted non-natives were never (legally) used for burning. Some campers persisted in illegally using camp-fires, and the dry cut logs provided them with easy fuel, and increased wildfire risk. And worst of all, many other people started planting exotic trees “in colaboration” with the project and this was also difficult to stop. 
Be a little bit stubborn. While it is good to listen and adapt, being stubborn and continuing with the project activities even under important critique and adverse conditions was the clue to a successful forest restoration. Being out there trying to make a change is a most fantastic feeling, but certainly not free of critique and not easy. 
You need a leader. When I started the project many people told me decisions had to be taken horizontally and with all stakeholders involved. I was told that leadership is a bad attribute, instead we should all be equals. And I tended to agree, but no longer do so. In retrospect, to me these ideas are true when the restoration work is being performed by the estate using public funds and when the managers are getting a salary to do their work. When the restoration work is lead by a volunteer like myself, it is asking for to much – and anyhow it worked as judging from before/after photos and the first formal studies. And leadership has to be there, I soon realized that if I did not take the leading role, somebody else did – often the same persons which told me leading was bad! I acknowledge the importance of post-implementation monitoring but so far never have had time nor funding to plan a proper monitoring including control, restored and reference sites. Regarding long-term maintenance, on several occasions I have asked other volunteers including one of the land owners to take charge, they have accepted but I again started taking charge of maintenance myself on a volunteer basis, because I considered the performed maintenance was insufficient. So now my long term plan is to continue being in charge of maintenance until old age, hopefully, until I peg out. No plans for the after death. Because few people know about the “Quebrada de los Refugios” forest restoration, which I believe is the first successful forest restoration for Argentina, and perhaps the second or third for all South America, I am now trying to get more people to know about this project.

Mining & Resource Extraction A large number of abandoned quarries, which have served to produce building materials, decorative stones and various inert materials, are located, more or less, throughout the territory between Fushekruja and Kruja cities, in Albania. Although the Albanian government has taken strict measures with DCM No. 468, dated 26.07.2018 has declared the area Kraste-Vrion “Protected Natural Landscape”, some entrepreneurs still continue their suspended activity under the pretext of site restoration.
Other quarries have been abandoned and left to rehabilitate their natural restoration. Some of them have been used as a land uncontrolled waste, thus turning into points and sources of pollution severe environmental in this area. Over the last 5 years, there has been a growing interest from both the Albanian government and also by local authorities for rational management of quarry activity in our country and for the restoration of abandoned quarries. They have damaged it very severe environmental balance and natural landscape, territory, vegetation, fauna and water resources.
Albania, as in all of Europe and beyond, is taking more measures strict, imposing more environmental restrictions on the activity of quarries. Also, the decade 2021-2030, promulgated on March 1, 2019 by The United Nations General Assembly as “Decade of Nations United for Ecosystem Restoration “, aims to scale massively restoration of degraded and destroyed ecosystems. Gradual restoration and exploitation of abandoned quarry sites with the intervention and investments can contribute to improving the quality of the environment in the areas and suburbs of the cities where they stretching. The project methodology proposed : To analyze the damages of caused by quarry activity and to determine the most suitable solution for proposed rehabilitation which may constitute a pilot model and an useful tool and usable not only for companies and businesses involved in this sector, also, for the local and central administration of protected areas and institutions state of any level. The compiled database can be enriched with it new data, followed by the concrete materialization of the proposed solutions.
The project strategy proposed: 1-Detailed examination of the quarry site, legal status, status of ownership, topographic, geometric graph, characteristics, data geological, hydrogeological, geotechnical and environmental.

Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: Combine park and forest management with agroforestry and agriculture development for ensuring local food and products for the community and tourism needs.
Ensuring potable and irrigation water for people, plants and fauna needs in every season and weather conditions.. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: Kruja is a historic and muse city distinguished for its ancient architecture and century resistance against enemies of Albania. Also there is located another ancient city named Albanopolis, very close to the quarry which will be rehabilitated and transformed in the recreative park 
In this context, our investment, except ecological, environmental and landscape benefits will have and cultural dimensions including recreational, aesthetic and spiritual values. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: The project will give positive impact on climate mitigation and adaption regulating and improving the microclimate of the region, water, temperature and humidity regime regulation, for floods, soil erosion and landslides control, for water and air quality improvement and pollution reducing.. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: Ni negative consequences  but positive benefits for the community, nature, ecosystem and tourism development. the main lesson learned is to protect nature, ecosystem and landscape and to sustainable use and manage natural resources, because the rehabilitation and restoration process is more difficult and more expensive and need many budget, investment and time to do it.
For this is necessary public education and awareness and setting up and respecting the legal framework for nature protection, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. The project will have high sustainability because: a- it is a work with public interest, with environmental, touristic, cultural and economic benefits, which will be realized by Medalb Institut and will be monitored by the state administrate of protected areas of Albania.
b- The investment is sustainable as it rehabilitates the damaged landscape, improves habitat and biodiversity conservation, reduces soil, water and air pollution and improves the / quality of life in the region.
c- The plants, shrubs and decorative trees that will be planted will be perennial and more multiple values and functions for improving air quality, to landscape, biodiversity and land erosion reduction.
d- Investments in infrastructure will have a positive long-term impact on tourism. "

We identify ecosystems surrounding areas, educate about ecosystem services, and stablish contigent value. With outreach we involve the community interest to create planns for efficient management at very low cost. We need to improve the outreach becouse people sometimes get territorial and get against the proyect. For example, on the sand dunes restoration proyect the concesionaries renting umbrelas and beach sits get against for the competition of space. But they lack information for ecological services that eventually will be beneficial for them to.
Also we creating green infrastructure at public parks. The outreach is less effort becouse people has more value for trees planted. The only problem is the subcontract companies that gives trimming services for the grass are the ones that kill more of the planted trees, we celebrate a 50% of survival rate between 3 to 5 years of planting trees.
Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological), Deforestation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry coral reef, and mangroves sufers from cultural eutrophication. native flowers, shurbs and trees for urban green infrastructure lack in urban area becouse people do not value very well their ecological services. Also the lack of runoff water management and suage systems increace significally the cultural eutrophication. These has increace the erosion rate due to the dead of coral structure, and climate change effect. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on historical information about ecological attributes at the site prior to degradation.we focus on pulling up the diversity on sites foucus on native, endemic and autoctonoc species. Restoration effort sites are selected due to key species prevaleces and/or space availity. Using local genotypes and increassing diversity garantee success. Just on coral reefs areas we has not success as we want to due to water quality. Educated community and raise the diversity richness of native and edemic species, to consolidate key species for each ecosystem.

Monitoring Details: Documente the grow thruw the time and survival rate. Start date, including baseline data collection: At the start of the project End Date: 2030

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: education is essencial and we need to improve. human activity is our main threat. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: by planting trees, shurbs and flowers. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: is one of our objective to restoration How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): using key species and sustitution in case of is needed. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): for these we have our own nursery of native plants. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): these is a need of more plan  due to  governamental burocrasy. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: the burocrasy has been dificult on different guvernamental offices. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Is essential to work on the limnology of the areas. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: The use of native species especially key species. Achieve a desirable species composition: Diversity richness Reinstate structural diversity: Key species are scential Recover ecosystem functionality: By education people will help and has help with the recovery function of the ecosystem. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: By making outreach on water quality make impact to society. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Human population and lackment guvernamental imvolment on restoration activities.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: improvement of ecological services for long term with low cost maintaines.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/riparian-reforestation-project-berg-and-breede-river-systems-western-cape-south-africa/	Riparian reforestation project: Berg and Breede River Systems, Western Cape, South Africa	South Africa	2020-11	2023-12	"The Reforest Action Project is located in the Western Cape, South Africa focusing on rehabilitation of riparian zones along the Berg and Breede Rivers. Reforest Action Project is privately funded with FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) as a project partner . There are three main implementing partners involved in the project: Breedekloof Wine and Tourism (BWT), Intaba Environmental Services and Wolseley Water User’s Association.The project has a three year time span (initiated in Jan 2021) and it aims to grow and plant 100 000 indigenous trees per year in a total of 40 sites per year (120 sites over 3 years). This is a total of 300 000 trees to be planted in approximately 60Ha of private land over 3 years (each site is an average of 0,5Ha in total).The Berg and Breede River Systems flow through the Cape Floristic Kingdom (with a Mediterranean Climate), with the dominating vegetation type known as ‘Fynbos’. This vegetation type is fire driven/ adapted. However, the riparian zones surrounding the Berg and Breede Rivers have become fire refuges due to the surrounding agricultural land that excludes fire, due to land management practices. This means that a riparian scrub has developed with a larger constituent of trees and shrubs dominating.
Most of the riparian lands that are to be rehabilitated in this project are privately owned and the implementing teams will be working in partnership with them. Rehabilitation actions are namely: propagation and planting of small trees (approx. 47 plant species) along dripper lines in the riparian zone and seeding where there is bare ground. Minimal monitoring and maintenance is currently occurring due to budget constraints.This project is still in its infancy and less than 10 sites have been planted by July 2021. The project is gaining momentum as interest and awareness is growing amongst landowners. Alternative funding is being sourced to supplement the project.
Our funding budget is very restrictive in developing short term action plans. 

STAPER categories:A3: Involve all relevant stakeholdersB6: Review, improve or establish targets, policies and strategies for ecosystem restorationC1: Identify appropriate measures for conducting ecosystem restorationC2: Consider how restoration  can support sustainability of agriculture/productionC4: Develop explicit implementation tasks, schedules, and budgetsC5: Implement the measuresD2: Adjust plans, expectations, procedures, and monitoring through adaptive managementD3: Share lessons learned from planning, financing, implementing and monitoring ecosystem restoration plans 
Agriculture & Livestock, Dams & Hydrology, Fire & Weather Events, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) Invasive alien trees are a major issue in the Berg and Breede Rivers, with dominance of Eucalyptus sp. and Acacia sp. from Australia. Many of these trees have been removed through the Working for Water Project. There is now a need to rehabilitate these lands with indigenous species and to prevent re-invasion of invasive plants. The invasive trees have outcompeted the indigenous plants due to out-shading and over competition of resources. Historically the indigenous trees were also harvested from the riparian zones with the initial settlers in the area. The river banks have also deepened and narrowed (channelized) over time due to the invasive trees, encroaching farming practices, bulldozing of river banks and change in hydrology. Soil erosion and river banks being washed away is a major issue together with lower water quality. Water quality and quantity is a major driver, as much of the river’s water is used for agriculture. The Klein Berg River (a tributary to the Berg River) is also a contributor to the City of Cape Town’s potable water supply. South Africa is a water-scarce region and there is increasing pressure for the supply of water in this area. Recently there was a severe drought (2018) and many city dwellers were severely restricted in their water use with the impending ‘Day Zero’, which fortunately did not happen. The City of Cape Town is the second largest city in South Africa and the population is also increasing at a rapid rate (averaging at 2% from 2019-2021 StatsSA), putting pressure on resources, especially water. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Reference ecosystems in the mid-reaches of the Berg and Breede Rivers are nearly impossible to find. Most of the Systems have been highly modified. We are using historical, anecdotal and Vegetation Type References to construct a plant species list.
The Berg and Breede River Systems flow through the Cape FlouristicFloristic Kingdom (with a Mediterranean Climate), with the dominating vegetation type known as ‘Fynbos’. This vegetation type is fire driven/ adapted and there is a variety of Vegetation Types within ‘Fynbos’. The riparian zones surrounding the Berg and Breede Rivers have become fire refuges due to the surrounding agricultural land that excludes fire, due to land management practices. This means that a riparian scrub has developed with a larger constituent of trees and shrubs.
Even though there is a strong focus on trees and shrubs in this project, there is also some seeding of pioneer species that is to be used in highly disturbed ecosystems. The funders (FSC) are needing projects that focus on planting of trees in order to brand their paper and products as sustainable sources.
Restoration success measures will be evaluated by the Project Funders and they are mostly looking at plant survival rates. Due to the funding cycle of 3 years and highly limited budget for monitoring, we are not able to establish benchmarks for evaluating success. Plant 100 000 trees per year (over a period of 3 years)
A total of 2500 trees planted per site
Each site is average of 5000m2 (0,5Ha) in size.
A total of +-40 sites are expected per year. Aiming for 120 sites over three years.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Landowners are the primary stakeholders. Although the Landowners were not consulted in the initial planning process (drawing up of budgets etc.). They are involved in the planning and implementation of the project on their land. We have produced a short video clip about the project and that has been sent to the Water User’s Associations in the area and also through word of mouth and social media.
When landowners come into contact with project managers, they have meeting(s) discussing the process and responsibilities. A landowner agreement is signed, the landowner contributes a small sum to the costs of the project (‘Landowner contribution’) and implementation begins.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: 1) Erect fences to keep cattle/ livestock out ot the site to prevent overgrazing and erosion
2) Remove alien invasive plants (minimal funds available through this budget - so alternative funding is needed)
3) Altered hydrology due to dams upstream and abstraction - not much can be done about this.
4) Altered geomorphology at some sites - appropriate planting to assist with slowing water speed and deposition in some cases. Alternative funding can be used for this, as these specialist plants are not classified as 'trees'. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: 1) Add compost to the holes where plants are to be planted. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: 1) Devise a plant list with appropriate plant species according to site vegetation type per site location. Use vegetation map data.
2) Determine what indigenous (native) plants are currently on the sites and what species are missing/required
3) Grow appropriate plants for planting out at specific sites that are genetically selected for specific river catchments
4) Plant plants in appropriate ecotones along river banks  on dripper lines
5) Interplant plants that have dies
6) Undertake some maintenance on sites to reduce the non-desirable species How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): The project is at a primary building block level in reinstating structural diversity, as it focuses on introducing some missing plant species in the landscape. There are 42 tree and shrub species that are being propagated and planted on the sites. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): The project is a primary building block in recovering of ecosystems, as it focuses on introducing some plant species in the landscape. No further efforts yet have been made to recover ecosystems further due to funding limitations. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Riparian zones are potential corridors for migration of species. Ideally as sites are acquired, then there will be more connection from the source downstream and within the catchment. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: This project will help with job creation for disadvantaged people. More alien clearing teams (contractors) will be upskilled in restoration work in the catchments. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The project is still in it's infancy, therefore it is difficult to determine. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: The project is still in it's infancy, therefore it is difficult to assess. Achieve a desirable species composition: We have planted 17 plant species so far ( by July 2021) and are aiming at planting out 40 plant species in total. We are at 42,5% at achieving this target. Reinstate structural diversity: Focus is primarily on introducing shrubs and trees, therefore the structural diversity is very low. Recover ecosystem functionality: Ecosystem function recovery is expected to be very low currently, as more structural and species diversity is needed. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: We are unaware of the extent and effectiveness of the external exchanges yet, due to the project being in it's infancy. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Low species diversity, secondary invasions, lack of connectivity within the agricultural landscape.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Job opportunities created. We are unaware of any other economic benefits to the community as of yet.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: Improvement in basic necessities is not measurable yet, due to infancy of project. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: Potential aesthetics improved through planting of indigenous tree and shrubs
Potential camping sites along river
Potential expansion of walking trails Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: Project is in it's infancy, so this is difficult to assess as the plants are still small. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: None that we are aware of. 1. Budget is based on a cost per plant planted. The funder is withholding 30% of the budget until they inspect the sites and are satisfied with the plant survival rates on the sites. This is very risky and restrictive for the project implementers. Alternative funding is being used to cover some of the costs and the landowner contributions will assist with the 30% gap.
2. Landowners are weary of signing agreements and there is resistance to paying their contribution to help with cover costs. We are trying to make plans for the landowners to pay off the amount over a longer time frame. Some landowners would prefer to purchase the irrigation and compost instead.
3. Plants propagated in the nursery requires a good stocktaking system. This assists with production planning in order for the correct number of seedlings and cuttings to be made for the approx. 40 plant species that also needs to come from separate river catchments. Workshopping and clear communication with the staff is assisting with making the stocktaking system to work better. Accurate record keeping is needed for research, invoicing and accountability to partner organizations.
4. Capacity building is key. Sharing of knowledge is important between organizations and with the teams that are implementing the work.
5. In order to implement a large projectproject, you need to work in team. Positive thinking, contentiousness, setting out roles/functions and clear communication in a team context is important, otherwise the team cannot function properly in its mandate/ vision. A work agreement was drawn up between the service provider(Intaba) and the organization that received the funding (BWT) to assist with this. There is no requirement set out by the funder to undertake post -implementation monitoring and long term maintenance. We hope that the landowners will become active in the maintenance of their sites – undertaking invasive alien clearing and irrigation etc. We may seek alternative funding to assist with the long term maintenance and monitoring of the sites.

Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological), Deforestation, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Present condition of soil is change day by day, with the help of manure and chemical free farming, there is no political factors, it’s farmer’s land increase the local biodiversity, economic help to the local people. due to less selling of the organic products farmer get loss. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Present reference ecosystem do chemical free farming since last 15 years so they have totally chemical free farming with good local biodiversity further they have their own past challenges and outcomes with the solutions.
They sell their own chemical free products. further, they provide employment to local , village, indigenous people. Soil restoration by chemical free farming, increased water table, all these support the local , native diversity as well as good quality of the food, moreover, increase the economic level of indigenous people and archive the indigenous knowledge.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: 1. restore the soil organic carbon
2. Maintain the nutritional cycle 
3. over come of nutrient deficiency
4. Crop pattern with respect to temperature, humidity and rainfall)
6. all this things take 5-6 years to complete the restoration of soil How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: soil  (carbon, nitrogen content, ph) & water analysis (Ground water table, analysis etc)
seasonal variation in weeds and fauna How this project achieved a desirable species composition: some useful insects like bugs, beetles, butterfly (with their natural life cycle), reptiles (snakes , lizard), birds, small mammals (Indian fox, Jackal, mongoose,  ) How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): with the help of soil restoration , they attract the good number of insects which attract the insectivorous birds and this lead s to the large raptors (once birds start build their nest)
also increase the pollinators. 
flowers of corp attract the  nectorivourous birds like species of Purple Sunbird  (Cinnyris asiaticus) How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Nitrogen cycle, carbon cycle, will be naturally generate 
also increase the plant-animal interactions with the help of native trees, native cropping pattern 
for instance butterfly comes on specific corp (when it is in flowing stage) , flowering of Drum stick (Moringa oleifera) support the Purple Sunbird , honey bees, wasp, shoot system support ants etc 
indirectly organic food products also reduced the threats of cancer , BP and Diabetes in local people How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Maintain the native crop gene  as well as if local or indigenous people get the revenue  from the  organic farming they will not locate to other place to generate income
further, no chemicals will penetrate in soil and ground water so also increase the quality of the water and soil 
all  manures are use for organic farming. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: reference habitat (Organic farm) , Mr. Devesh Patel has  provide knowledge as well as revenue to sustain their life
so this area (farm land) near Vadodara city  can also provide knowledge to local people as well as revenue 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Project will be successful after 4 years
provide documentation of traditional knowledge as well as economic growth to locals

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/forest-restoration-in-sahyadri-the-northern-western-ghats/	Forest restoration in Sahyadri, the Northern Western Ghats.	India	2005-06	2030-12	"A forest restoration project is being implemented on a privately owned land in hilly area, at Wan-kusawade, Taluka Patan, District Satara in Maharashtra, India. It is part of hilly region locally known as Sahyadri, the Northern Western Ghat. This area forms catchment of Koyna backwaters, one of the largest hydro-electric projects and adjacent to Koyna wildlife sanctuary.
Being part of Western Ghats, the climatically climax ecosystem is ‘semi-evergreen tropical forests’, with very high rainfall average annual 5,500 mm, average altitude 897 m from MSL. Sahyadri mountain ranges have been popular as land of ‘hill forts’ and have housed very small human population since beginning owing to resource availability, mainly low cultivable land and water sources. These ranges have been abundant in forests and high biological diversity.
Considering the degraded lands in overall region & project catchment, it was decided to set the goal for land development as ‘Restoration of semi-evergreen forest’ with ‘assisted natural regeneration’ that will strengthen the natural resources and follow ecological succession to become sustainable project in a long run. Now after 15 years, one can see that the natural regenerative capacity of land has improved while building much required resilience in the system.Agriculture & Livestock, Dams & Hydrology, Deforestation, Fragmentation The land and surrounding areas have been under intense human utilization roughly since 1960. As per the socio-ecological setting and local people, during old times, there was a very dense forest in this area with key species like The Indian Gaur or Bison (Bos gaurus), The Bengal tiger ( Panthera tigris tigris). Eventually for various reasons like wood extraction, cultivation, grazing, fuel wood cutting; the forests slowly degraded to present condition of scattered shrubs, scrub & grassy patches. This also initiated soil erosion in form of gullies, loss of soil fertility and soil moisture. This region has been blessed with natural springs on which the local livelihood depends, now with slight decrease in spring discharge volume. With this overall degradation, the streams have lost their riparian vegetation & habitats. So, currently hardly any area is seen under original semi-evergreen forest cover, with some exceptions as government forest and sacred groves protected by the eco-wise tradition by the communities in the name of their local deities.
The local community have been largely agrarian and depended upon the rice cultivation in river valley, shifting cultivation on hill slopes, cattle, NTFP from surrounding forests. It is hard to live in hills with forests and high rainfall due to the limiting factor of availability of year-round water sources. So, the human population of these remote regions that not connected to main economic centers, is very low.
After the Koyna dam construction in 1964, the river valley was submerged, destroying cultivable areas of these hill communities. Some of the villagers then shifted to resettlement areas and some to the higher slopes. This triggered increase in shifting cultivation on slopes and more and more land started becoming open with continual loss of original forest cover. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on contemporary reference sites or existing analogues of the pre-degradation ecosystem.The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data)
The reference ecosystem of the area is restricted mainly to the government protected wildlife sanctuary, some in-accessible patches of forests and sacred groves protected by the communities. It is semi-evergreen tropical forest with regionally special species of flora. The forest character varies from plateau to slopes depending upon environmental conditions and strata. The biodiversity of such forest ecosystem is well documented by researchers and government departments like Botanical survey of India, Zoological survey of India. This region is dominated by laterite rock and deep lateritic soils.
The seral stages in ecological succession from open soil conditions to a forest are clearly seen in the landscape and shows steps by which the ecosystem restoration will progress. There are 4 to 5 key stages in restoration like clump forming grass community, then shrub clusters, then sparse dwarf tree canopy, dense tree canopy and finally the mature semi-evergreen forests. Each stage has specific set of floral community and associated faunal diversity, which act as indicators of restoration progress.
All these seral stages and reference ecosystem areas were studied in detail to understand the process. When project was initiated, main objective was to improve the physical structure by controlling soil erosion, improving organic matter, increasing soil fertility and soil moisture. Focus on plantation is kept to minimum, just to increase the diversity of area specific flora. Otherwise, it is aimed to increase the natural regenerative capacity of land so that process of restoration will happen passively after initial physical work. A thorough understanding of social practices, traditional knowledge of locals, their time-tested techniques helped in planning the restoration activities and techniques. This decreased external inputs required in the effort and also reduced ecological footprint of the work.
A close monitoring of the process and results have helped in changing some activities like period of plantation, fencing options or species selection. Broad objective of the project is ‘to establish model of eco-restoration in Western ghats for private lands’ along with restoration of near original forest cover on land. It will benefit local landscape by providing a safe habitat for small fauna, collection of local plants, reduction in soil erosion and soil temperatures and a carbon sink. Categorical use of local, low cost techniques will make them easily replicable locally while being a showcase for conservation and restoration. Local community also will get benefitted by providing employment at village level.

Monitoring Details: Regular visits for documentation, result monitoring & troubleshooting or changes to restoration activities.
The land being owned by city dwellers, they are the main stakeholders in this project apart from natural elements for which the effort is being taken. The owners have been actively involved in the entire process write from basic eco-assessment. The goal setting and entire planning was done with their inputs and they have strongly supported throughout implementation process. Their vision to give back to nature is the main driving force behind this work and their active involvement in spreading the word about achievements is greatly appreciated by society. Together with the implementing agency, they have been involved in awareness creation about eco-restoration as a tool to achieve conservation of nature.
The owners visualize this land to be dedicated for the cause of conservation perpetually and strive to make the necessary arrangements to maintain the land use as forest, not to be converted to any other anthropocentric land-use. The project has gained good publicity through various outreach events like talks, online sessions, field visits, articles in newspapers.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: The purchase of land from local villagers to urban owners changed the land use from cultivation & resource extraction to conservation. And then protection from all negative human activities was done through a thorn fence combined with live hedge. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: Stream restoration through appropriate stone structures, plantations was initiated in first phase of physical work. Then site specific measures to control soil erosion, gully formation, sheet flow, were installed. Both these measures used local stone and local people. Thirdly to restore soil structure, mulching of local grass cover was aided with protection to vegetation & biomass from grazing & fire. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Plantation of local forest trees with specific percentage as seen in reference forest patches, has been a focus since beginning. This has helped in introducing correct species at correct locations that will finally form the higher canopy. Apart from this, the focus is on natural regeneration that goes hand-in-hand with soil structure improvement and changing soil conditions. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): The land has deep, fine soil cover that has been a focus for quality improvement which can be seen in indicator species. Central policy was to arrest soil erosion and addition of local biomass. So as the restoration work progresses faunal chains will get established. The topography and small land features when protected becomes various microhabitats. Some small habitats like ponds, brush piles, mounds were categorically planned to increase the habitat diversity. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Protection to vegetation, and letting nature’s process take place was the main strategy that have worked well. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): The land is a small functioning unit of entire landscape. To keep it as is, hard boundaries were avoided, diversion of streams was never planned but streams are restored so as to retain the connection. Gully formation is controlled for soil erosion control. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: Involvement of local villagers in various ways has been planned since beginning. Right from employing those for various land works to conducting specific sessions for their awareness creation have been undertaken. This helps connecting them to activities happening on land for conservation. It has helped to certain extent for tackling issues like cattle grazing control, general support of village for the work, etc. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Protection by local means have worked well over these years since 2006 and have effectively stopped the threats like cattle grazing, fire, and cutting completely. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: Measures taken to arrest soil, increase it’s fertility and moisture have worked well. This in totality has helped restoring soil, soil moisture and hydrology. The indicators are seen in biodiversity, water flows and soil properties. Even the soil organic carbon shows a positive trend across various habitats than the control sample. Achieve a desirable species composition: Since this is an ongoing process, project is yet to achieve the final ecosystem structure and will take long time. But existing species composition is indicating the present seral stage of dense shrubbery which is the desirable output at this point in time. Local composition of shrub clusters is now present with seasonal diversity. Reinstate structural diversity: There is steady change in indicator species groups from open conditions to dense shrubbery. Presence of key faunal species like insectivorous reptiles, birds indicate increase in insect species & numbers, establishing initial food chains. More complex food chains & webs will get strengthened as the years progress. A variety of micro habitats all over the land attract diversity of species. Recover ecosystem functionality: The mulching of biomass grown naturally during monsoon has helped in restoring nutrient cycling. This has also shown that natural processes have been established that increase the plant diversity, retains whole life cycle of all plant species, offering various associations like butterfly host plants. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: Considering that the area of project is very small for the immediate landscape of the village catchment, very few exchanges are possible. One of them is reinforcement of local hydrological structure. The streams passing through land are well protected and do not initiate soil erosion. Also, some specific faunal species are seen just on project land otherwise absent in immediate surrounding. Gully plugging & vegetation growth have reduced soil erosion. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Continuous maintenance of dry thorn fence is required that keeps grazing cattle outside. Fire is another limiting factor in restoration here, so yearly work of making fireline is much needed to protect from fire in dry season. As the fire is induced by locals, it is necessary to keep a continuous dialogue with them for more awareness creation.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: As a policy, we have always preferred involving local individuals in restoration work that generates some income for them. This land of 24 acres supports one family completely and owners have also come forward to support the education of children of the family.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: Work on land has ensured recharging of borewell that is the sole source of water for the land. Production of good quality fodder from the land is extracted by the caretaker for his cattle, so supplying it’s yearly need of fodder. But apart from this, it is not allowed to extract anything at this point since it is vital source for restoring land processes. Eventually once the ecosystem is fully restored, controlled extraction might be allowed. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: The land owners completely enjoy the process and learn through the progress. A restoring land looks different than outside with more cover & greenery, and functionality which is appreciated by locals, owners & visitors. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: Soil erosion from this land has completely stopped now, so it doesn’t contribute to siltation of Koyna dam. Even the water flowing through is crystal clear even in high intensity monsoon as compared to adjacent lands, which is a great achievement. Lowering of soil temperatures locally means this land is not adding to global temperature rise. It is also acting as a carbon sink. All this work has improved the micro-climate to great extent. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: There is one apprehension in local people’s mind that this work will attract more wild animals like wild boar, leopard or bear and increase human-wildlife conflict. This could be a potential threat to their agriculture or cattle. Otherwise, they appreciate the efforts of planting various species and increase in fodder availability. This process of restoration have been a learning curve for the team, testing patience of owners at all times in understanding the slower rate of nature reestablishment, and why ecological restoration is a better approach than plantations for landscape level restoration. Continuous documentation of the process has also helped in understanding natural succession, entry-exit of species, indicators of various stages, etc. It helped in changing the strategies planned in first year like species selection, use of local materials or addition of nutrients, etc.
It also triggered a thought process for handling deliberate negative actions by anti-social elements, like fire and tested the resilience of land that is in place due to this slow successional restoration.
The data gathered so far can substantiate many research subjects and provide insights to ecological succession. Current status of project is post-implementation maintenance and monitoring. After understanding the long-term requirements of such restoration projects, the owners and consultants have jointly worked out a plan to safeguard the land and restoration work. The plan is, handing over the land to a trust so that it can form a field station for experiments in restoration, education and research. This could be most effective way apart from keeping the land-use unchanged. With this, various funding sources like CSR, individuals, research funds can be explored for future actions. "

Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fire & Weather Events, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Other The area is characterized for presenting a high level of degradation for: the harsh climate, high exposure to sunlight and anthropogenic factors, primarily deforestation activities throughout the last centuries. Also, the recent wildfire activity serves as a contributory factor for overall land degradation. Natural factors (i.e. biophysical, meteorological, and climactic) leading to overall land degradation in the area are substantially significant, in contrast to the any socio-economic factors. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).In Gran Canaria (Canary Islands) reforestation actions will take place in the priority habitat 4050, “”Endemic Macaronesian heaths”. The objective of habitat restoration includes the endemic macaronesian heaths, where dry laurel forest species would be planted. The primary aim of such plantations is to promote proactiveness in conservation and compensation for habitat impacts and/or loss, as well as improving the general resilience of the area, subjected to land degradation factors.  Another key objective is to improve the environmental quality and water infiltration and permeation to the underlying soil strata, control runoff and reverse, or stagnate the currently increasing probability of desertification.
In Portugal reforestation actions will take place mainly in the habitat 9230, “Galicio-Portuguese oak woods with Quercus robur and Quercus pyrenaica”. The objective is to restore this habitat subject to land degradation and human impacts, as indicated before. Like the restoration in Gran Canaria, another key objective is to improve water availability through reducing runoff and improving infiltration and at the same time reduce the desertification risk.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/hirola-restoration-project-kenya/	Hirola Restoration Project, Kenya	Kenya	2017-04	2027-04	"The hirola Restoration Project focuses on rangeland restoration for the critically endangered hirola antelope (Beatragus hunteri) in eastern Kenya. With a global population of fewer than 500 individuals, the hirola is considered the world’s most endangered antelope. Historically hirola occurred in open savannah grassland with <30% tree cover, however, recent satellite imagery indicates a ~ 300% increase in tree cover over the last 27 years. This increase has been associated with elephant extirpation, climate change and overgrazing. Our project is therefore working to protect, restore and promote the establishment of native grasslands in the hirola’s geographic range. We are doing this in partnership with Somali pastoralists to identify (1) tree encroached areas that will respond positively to management interventions, (2) identifying bare sites that can be restored and (3) promoting nature-based solutions for the local communities. Our lessons from testing best restoration strategies indicated that the success of our program will vary depending on the restoration approach, different soil types found here and species used in restoration.Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) Scientists have conjectured hirola rangeland degradation be linked to several factors. Between 1985 and 2012 a ~300% increase in invasive tree cover emanating from the extirpation of 5000 elephants have been reported in this region. Other factors such as overgrazing and droughts are suspected to be in part responsible for the continued degradation. These encroaching trees have led to a reduction in the grassland areas (suitable range) to no more than 1,500 km2 within the larger hirola historical range. The changing landscape made it possible and lucrative for the locals to shift from grass-eating cattle production to tree/shrub-eating goat and camel production. However, recent studies suggest that hirola avoid areas with high tree cover, primarily due to food limitation. Thus, if tree encroachment trends continue, recovery of hirola will soon become insurmountable. Habitat loss due to tree encroachment, fragmentation, and degradation is a common issue in many rangelands. Tree encroachment and the other factors mentioned can affect the quality of the soil (nutrients) and pasture availability. Along with other species in southeastern Kenya. Moreover, climate patterns have been changing in this region. Rainfall declined by 6.3mm/year, or ca. 246 mm total between 1970 and 2009 resulting in dry conditions that favor trees over grasses. Together, all of these changes have led to reduced grassland area, which also directly impacts hirola populations, livestock production and threatens local livelihoods in eastern Kenya. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on historical information about ecological attributes at the site prior to degradation.Project overall Goal
The goal of this project is to contribute towards the long-term recovery of the hirola population by addressing the primary threat facing them. The project will restore rangelands for hirola and seek to understand the link between habitat degradation and food quality. Moreover, the project will include capacity development and local Somali pastoralist (community) involvement through education and outreach.
Project specific objectives
The specific objectives of the overall project are:
1) Reduce areas under tree encroachment by clearing 2500 hectares of invasive trees and increase grass cover by reseeding 1000 hectares with native grasses.
2) Establish nutritional and mechanical properties of hirola food (pasture) including forage quality.
3) Promote local involvement through community education and outreach while improving local livelihoods by establishing nature-based income-generating activities.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The primary stakeholders of the project are nomadic pastoralists of Somali origin. Before the establishment of the project, we did a survey to determine locally accepted management interventions. Subsequently, we held meeting across 10 villages to sensitize communities and involve them in key activities of our project including manual removal of trees, reseeding and harvesting, and storage of seeds. The key interest of the locals included what would be (i) the future of their historical pastoral lifestyle to which most of the locals leaned towards favoring a system that would support their lifestyle. (ii) they were also concerned about how they will benefit from increased grass, to which the project would ensure inclusion through a planned grazing system. Other concerns included (iii) If they will get employment and other opportunities from these efforts such as nature-based solutions commented towards livelihood development. Overall, the project has since involved over 100 laborers employed as restoration agents and an additional 30 scouts to be responsible for antipoaching efforts. Besides, the project has in place nature-based enterprises such as native grass seed harvesting and hay production that is committed to boosting the locals’ livelihoods. We also run an education and awareness programme based on village meetings, school visits, workshops, public rallies, and cinemas.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: The hirola rangeland has been associated with a nearly 300% increase in tree cover and a 75% reduction in grass cover. Currently, we are actively reducing invasive tree cover by manually cutting and thinning down bushes to achieve a desirable hirola habitat of grassland with less than 30% tree cover. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: During the first year of our restoration, we tested the condition necessary for the reestablishments of grass rangeland across the different soil types in hirola rangeland. The results of these studies are yet to be published, however, in soil types deficient in minerals, we employ the use of locally available livestock manure to boost fertility, and in those that soil is deficient of aeration due to soil capping, we use tilling to stimulate aeration. Most of the physical conditions in this ecosystem were acceptably met to facilitate restoration How this project achieved a desirable species composition: We selected four species based on case history for grasses that perform well across the different soil types in the region to be used for restoration. These grass species are also the leading food for hirola. Similarly, the soil seed bank offers another array of species that will complement the selected species to enable us to achieve the desired species composition How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): We rolled out landscape-level restoration across different soil types within hirola rangeland (loam, black cotton, and red sandy soil) and in consideration of places with high hirola concentration. Upon achieving the desire consistency and persistence in our reestablished grasses in the restoration islands, we will move ahead to test the response of large herbivores towards restored areas. We hope to influence the population of herbivores with increased food availability particularly the population of hirola. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Alongside habitat restoration designed to improving soil seedbank, we run an antipoaching programme to guard elephants that are instrumental to the maintaining of grasslands. Hirola habitat degradation has been strongly linked to the extirpation of elephants from hirola rangeland. Together, these initiatives will ensure the long-term sustainability of our project. Further, we have initiated planned grazing to minimize grazing pressure that contributes to degradation. Together with the increased availability of a variety of food through restored grassland, we hope to reduce environmental stressors. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Most of the hirola occur within communally owned land outside formally protected areas. Besides, habitat restoration we have actively been pursuing the formation of community protected areas within hirola concentration areas and protection of potential corridors to all the different population interact and maintain connectivity. We are also protecting riverine flood plains that offer grasses during prolonged drought along the Tana and river channels which is a critical source of water during prolonged droughts. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: The majority of the locals are nomadic pastoralists of Somali origin, this project in itself has a knock-on benefit to their livelihood by increasing access to pasture. Moreover, our project has a goal to support and improve the local livelihoods through alternative nature-based economic activities. This includes native grass seed farming to be sold to restoration projects all over the region, Improved livestock production through, hay production and sale, and beekeeping among others. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Although the process is slow, our initiative to manually remove invasive tree species has been effective. So far, we have managed to clear 494.2 acres (200 hectares) of invasive Acacia reficiens within a year in the core hirola concentration areas. For the next three years, we hope to reclaim 2500 hectares of land from invasive tree species. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: During the first year of our restoration project, we tested the conditions favorable for the restoration of grasslands. The results of the study indicated that the soil physical conditions were within acceptable limits to allow for the restoration of grasslands. Achieve a desirable species composition: To achieve desirable specie composition, we combined manual removal of undesired invasive Acacia reficiens and reseeding the rangeland with desired grass species identified from case history to perform well in the region and to be the leading food for hirola. To complement this, we have provided favorable conditions for seedbank to reestablish other desired species that were initially limited by tree cover. Reinstate structural diversity: The project is yet to establish how our initiative has affected both flora and fauna in the focus areas Recover ecosystem functionality: Our approach does not only include the restoration of grasslands but also, we seek to maintain the grasslands by protecting elephants that are responsible for the maintenance of open grasslands. The initial decline of hirola has been identified to the local extirpation of elephants in the rangeland presumably due to poaching pressure. Recently the elephants have started recolonizing the rangeland and we are keen on maintaining a healthy population that will further help in maintaining the rangeland. Similarly, by reseeding we are promoting seedbank that has been depleted over the years as a result of prolonged degradation. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: N/A Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Invasive tree species is a widespread factor that limits the recovery of grasslands, similarly, the region has been associated with overstocking that contributes to degradations. Climate change has also been suspected to play a critical role with variable rainfall and prolonged droughts becoming more common.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Our initiative is hinged on community participation. Through manual removal of invasive tree species, the project offers jobs to over 100 laborers each year to help in the project. Furthermore, the project has a provision to improve the local livelihoods whose support and goodwill are key to the success of the project.  Our project explores nature-based enterprises such as native grass seed harvesting, beekeeping, hay production, etc. to provide alternative income generation activities for them.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: Although the project does not directly offer food to the locals, the project supports their basic pastoral livelihoods to achieve a win-win situation provision of pasture. The byproducts of the project such as cleared invasive tree species can be used by local for timber and fuel. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: The locals in this region ascribe to hirola being a near-mythical creature and are in support of its restoration. Similarly, the hirola is a flagship species in this region and it is the symbolic animal on the county government logo. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: Our region is low lying and often affected by floods from the river Tana, sheet erosion is also common during prolonged droughts. Our initiative to restore grasses potentially helps reduce these phenomena. Further, through case history, we run a one health programme to vaccinate livestock this is coupled with planned grazing. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: None The first year of our project involved testing the conditions necessary to reestablish grasslands. The study that is yet to be published included seedbank study and testing different restoration approaches. We found restoration based on different soil types within hirola rangeland, the species of grass used for restoration, seasonality and the restoration approach. The study has since been used to effect landscape-level restoration through restoration islands designed to utilizer scares resources in arid and semiarid areas. The landscape changes have been associated with elephant extirpation, overgrazing, fire suppression and climate variability in the region, as such, we have coupled habitat restoration with planned grazing to reduce the pressure overgrazing brought by over a million heads of livestock. Further, Elephants recently began to recolonize the region, thus we initiated a community-based antipoaching effort to maintain a healthy elephant population that will be instrumental in the maintenance of open habitats. These activities are bestowed on the community conservation area we helped to establish and managed by the local community. "

The Beirut River is an Important Bird Area (IBA 4), it is undoubtedly one of the most important areas for bird migration in Lebanon, with important threatened species relying on the valley during spring migration. Due to the deteriorating condition of the Beirut River watershed especially in the city, we have seen a major loss of wildlife and insect habitat downstream the river. After 6 months of the first forest implementation, we already started to see native fauna coming back to live in the newly established ecosystem. For the Beirut RiverLESS Urban Forest, we visited a native established forest upstream within the Beirut River watershed to conduct a botanical survey of the native species living in the forest. We then planted 17 available species of the 25 surveyed species in our plot adjacent to the river to bring back the native forest ecosystem into the city.

Forests connect across boundaries, watersheds and ecosystems and are not defined by cultural and political boundaries. Within 3 months the forest transformed into a transition space between the city and the native ecosystem, connecting humans and other organisms.Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The reference ecosystem is primarily based on contemporary reference sites or existing analogues of the pre-degradation ecosystem.Reclaiming urban landfills through urban afforestation, hence regenerating biodiversity, restoring the water cycle, and providing shared space for humans and other organisms.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/restore-with-resilience-coral-reefs/	Restore with Resilience [Coral Reefs]	United States of America	2019-06	2022-05	"Rising temperatures threaten coral reefs, which dissipate wave and storm energy to protect nearby shorelines for nearly 200 million people worldwide. To enhance coastal protection, this novel project will identify thermally tolerant coral stocks, propagate in nurseries and outplant at three sites on O’ahu, Hawai’i. Federal, state, academic and non-profit partners will test the efficacy of this strategy and evaluate best practices that will be transferable to increase efforts across the state.Climate Change, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry In addition to local threats to Hawai’i’s coral reefs, increasing sea surface temperatures that cause coral bleaching and ocean acidification that weakens coral skeletal structures and calcification, pose new and significant stresses to these vital ecosystems. Over the past 30 years we have lost 50% of corals worldwide. It is predicted that only 10% of corals will survive past 2050 as sea surface temperatures continue to increase. Climate change, driven by human activity, is now the biggest threat to corals and the main cause of large-scale bleaching events. This is particularly concerning in Hawai’i, where coral reefs generate more than $360 million each year with tourism as the main driver of Hawai’i’s economy (DLNR 1999). In Hawai’i we had back-to-back widespread bleaching events in 2014 and 2015, plus another event in 2019. While many of these corals recovered, warming events are anticipated to be more frequent and last longer in the near future. It is not enough to restore coral cover if the stocks used will succumb to this stress. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and over 2,000 miles from the nearest land mass, the entire state of Hawai’i is classified as being within the coastal zone, and therefore constantly under threat from the impacts of storms, floods and sea level rise. Storm surge inundation of coastal areas can have serious consequences since much of Hawai’i’s expansive industrial infrastructure and human population, over 1.4 million people, are clustered along the coastlines. The island of O’ahu, where this project is based, is the most populated housing two-thirds of all residents. Resilient coral stocks would restore biological function, support a full diversity of services, and will increase in size over time by natural accretion. Out-planted corals will provide a service immediately, and continue to grow as sea level rise becomes more imminent. In addition to reducing storm surge energy, coral reefs are reservoirs of biodiversity that play central roles in tourism, fisheries and recreational industries. An intact Hawaiian coral reefscape supports thousands of fish and invertebrate
species as well as sea turtles and the corals themselves.

Monitoring Details: We will monitor abiotic conditions at each site alongside a subset of individually tagged corals and transects. Monitoring of individual corals is critical for the validation of the selection techniques we propose and will allow us to measure differences between random and tailored coral communities in the restoration framework, comparing outcomes to our hypothesized results. Transect surveys will complement the monitoring of individual corals and provide a community level measurement of each treatment. At each site we will follow previously established best practices and record colony survivorship, size, disease, bleaching condition, fragmentation and signs of predation. We will also collect data on fish recruitment, temperature, light and sedimentation to quantify environmental conditions relating to the out-planting. The quarterly monitoring schedule will capture seasonal variation and successional processes that occur after the introduction of new coral colonies as well as the thermal maximum during late summer, which provides further context for outcomes of restoration executed with prior knowledge on stress tolerance. In the event of a natural bleaching event, we will opportunistically monitor out-planted corals over time to document damage and recovery as it relates to thermally tolerant and unknown coral phenotypes.

Some years ago, the town installed two aerating fountains.  The fountains improve water quality, but our 368 meters of living shoreline provide superior water quality improvements. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on historical information about ecological attributes at the site prior to degradation.The reference ecosystem is a coastal lake, be it brackish or freshwater.  The historical reference was a more healthy system with good fishery.  Development over the decades has led to decline in water quality and decline in fishery.  By adopting BMPs in the watershed, improved stormwater systems and removal of hard walls, the lake is on a trajectory to improvement. Ecological goals: improve habitat, improve water quality function.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/renature-monchique/	Renature Monchique	Portugal	2019-03	2020-04	"The primary objective of this partner-based project is to begin a process that assists private landowners within the municipal district of Monchique, Algarve Region, Portugal, affected by the wildfire of 2018. As most landowners have small-holdings, the project-based process required to access financial support is onerous and in many instances linked to reforestation legislation.The one-year project is funded by the Ryanair passengers Carbon Offset Fund. Based on ecological restoration principles, the restoration process focuses on the recovery of agriculturally important endemic and naturalized species in the first instance (Quercus suber, Arbutus unedo, Castanea sativa) as well as threatened endemic species (e.g. Quercus canariensis). In combination with the ‘planting´, land degradation (under SDG 15 and SDG 13) is being assessed via a PhD study on the link between land degradation, land-use typologies, climate change and future demands for ecosystem services. The long-term aim of this study (based on available funds) is to install an ecological restoration process linked to the participation of landowners for the restoration of the Natura 2000 habitats affected by wildfires in this area.From a socio-ecological perspective, ecosystem resilience is being researched along with the socio-economic vulnerability of rural livelihoods affected by land degradation.

Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fire & Weather Events, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Other As the Renature Monchique project (like many ‘reforestation’ projects) is only funded for 1 year, a PhD study* has been set-up to research the historical and long-term aspects of land degradation within this area. The focus of this study is on the Seixe River Basin, a large part of which is included in the Renature Monchique project (see: TerraSeixe Project) and which was affected by the 2018 wildfire. The purpose of the PhD study is to determine the degree of degradation and the effect of land-use typologies on ecosystem structure and functioning and impacts on local biodiversity. Included in this study are issues related to landscape-scale impacts, such as fragmentation, the linkage between land-uses and the water cycle as well as the effect on future ecosystem services under the current scenario taking into account climate change.
As mentioned above, the socio-ecological and socio-economic/political aspects of land degradation will be assessed under the PhD study. This study aims to include a monitoring and evaluation plan (Aftercare) for the activities conducted under the Renature Monchique, which aims to plant around 75,000 trees. Land (soil) rehabilitation also forms part of the field-work to be conducted under the PhD – again, depending on available funding for this activity.
*Contact Justin Roborg-Söndergaard (justi.rs@campus.fct.unl.pt). The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).A primary key attribute relating to this project is that it is in a Natura 2000 classified area.
Benchmarks for determining restoration success still need to be assessed and analysed – other than remotely sensed data there is very little available field-based data on the degree of land degradation and soil erosion affecting the Renature Monchique project sites or, for that matter, the Seixe River Basin. The PhD study aims to rectify this situation, providing a baseline using remote-sensing and field-based data to determine benchmarks for assessing the progress (success) of the interventions under the Renature Monchique project and the possibility of future ecological restoration actions in this area.
The rationale for determining the reference system(s) is based on the Natura 2000 habitats descriptions (desk-based), available historical records (literature and interviews with local landowners), observations of existing (intact) ecosystems, new data (based on site analysis – SWOT-C/Wheel) and other information that may be available, such as the recent baseline studies done under the TerraSeixe project. The Renature Monchique´s primary goal is ‘carbon offsetting’ via tree planting. Although planned and designed as an ecological restoration project, the goal this project must first fulfill is established by this parameter and a metric based on the number of trees planted.
From an a socio-economic perspective, although planned and designed as an ecological restoration project (i.e. focused on ecosystems) as opposed to a reforestation project (i.e. focused on trees), the approach taken is to first recover agriculture-based areas that use endemic/naturalized species, such as ‘sobreirals’ for cork oak production by planting Quercus suber, ‘medronheirals’ for beverage and fruit production by planting Arbutus unedo and chestnut tree groves for ‘castenheiro’ (chestnut) production by planting Castanea sativa. Linked with this process is the ecological approach that aims to recover endemic/endangered tree species (as components of ecosystems) via the conversion of existing eucalyptus plantations and via riparian recovery (all river systems are inundated with eucalyptus and invasive species, such as Acacia spp.).

Monitoring Details: The Aftercare programme was written into the original project plan - however, this aspect of the project is reliant on further funds for the Renature Monchique project (March 2019-April 2020) beyond April 2020 and the possibility of funds for the PhD study which will manage this process, both under a project extension and as part of the PhD study. Start date, including baseline data collection: This plan will begin in January 2020 under the Renature Monchique project - assessing the success of the planting regime which started in November 2019 (after the first rains). Baseline data collection started when the field work on the project commenced, i.e. October 2019. End Date: Not yet applicable - the project is ongoing.
The primary stakeholders are the landowners. Landowners were included via a communication process that involved advertising the project, letters and telephone calls. The latter 2 actions were supported by the municipality of Monchique, while the former is being coordinated by GEOTA via a public relations initiative using Facebook and a web-series relating to the project.
The involvement of landowners is participatory – 1st based on interviews, 2nd on an agreement for a restoration design that addresses their needs, concerns and interests, and 3rd on an agreement for the work to begin. Communication with landowners is direct, i.e. the project management visit them regularly on their land. Also, the landowners have been included in the public relations initiative for the project under the auspices of GEOTA. Currently, apart from the direct contact with landowners which involves discussing the interventions and basis for these interventions, there is no education or outreach programme (funding and the project goal restricted this possibility). However, a proposal has been submitted for this type of programme to be included in the possible continuation of the project, i.e. beyond April 2020. GEOTA will also apply for national/regional funding to support this type of programme beyond April 2020.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Each site has been and is being assessed for threats such as soil erosion/over-utilization, invasive species and biodiversity. Almost every site requires conversion from eucalyptus to endemic species and the removal of invasive species, such as Acacia spp., along with a planned intervention to increase biodiversity through the assessment of vegetation communities. As the fire of 32018 destroyed most of these communities, How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: The planning and design processes included a focus on the intimate link between land-uses (decision-based) and the water cycle.  Recovery of the hydrological systems (water-lines, streams and rivers) was included in the original plan. While the design took into account water flows (run-off) and the effects of this owing to a lack of vegetation (a result of the fire), slope steepness and soil type as well as appropriate interventions to encourage water infiltration. 
Substrate (physical and chemical) where needed is being added as part of the planting process to support soil water retention and plant growth. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: The primary aim is to first recover the socio-economic aspects of the intervention affected by the fires. This is to be achieved by using ecological recovery techniques, i.e. by increasing the number of commercially-viable endemic species. This means recovering areas of agricultural importance such as oak (sobreiral), strawberry (medronheiral) and chestnut tree groves.
Second to this process is the recovery of other endemic and threatened species such as Quercus canariensis in the first instance (access to seed and seedlings for these species is very difficult and must be planned well in advance - the project only started in March 2020 and is only planned for 1 year). For this purpose, GEOTA has formed an alliance with the Évora University who have a LIFE project focused on this aspect, i.e. the recovery/restoration of endemic species including Quercus canariensis and Rhododendron ponticum baeticum, both endemic to this area.
Invasive species are being appropriately controlled and removed where possible. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): This process relates directly to the state of degradation regarding the sites where restoration actions are taking place. These sites have been badly affected and currently display low biodiversity, i.e. a handful of species that have been able to regenerate after the fire. The possibility of reinstating structural diversity in 1 year is daunting. Therefore, this aspect of the project is entirely reliant on the possibility that funding will be extended beyond April 2020. Despite this requirement, the PhD study will be carried out should there be an extension of funds or not. If not, this phase will be incorporated into the PhD study based as experimental actions based on ecological restoration principles. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Reliant on the extension of funds and the PhD study. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Reliant on the extension of funds and the PhD study. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: The activities undertaken are to first address the socio-economic needs, concerns and interests of the landowners, also considering possible future climate change effects, as part of the process to ecologically restore endemic species and develop ecosystem structure based on a reference system(s). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: This process is ongoing and will involve actions over the long-term owing to the advanced state of invasion, particularly in the river systems. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: As the project groundwork only began in October 2019 and is ongoing, there is no supporting data to report on this aspect as yet. Achieve a desirable species composition: As the project groundwork only began in October 2019 and is ongoing, there is no supporting data to report on this aspect as yet. Reinstate structural diversity: As the project groundwork only began in October 2019 and is ongoing, there is no supporting data to report on this aspect as yet. Recover ecosystem functionality: As the project groundwork only began in October 2019 and is ongoing, there is no supporting data to report on this aspect as yet. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: As the project groundwork only began in October 2019 and is ongoing, there is no supporting data to report on this aspect as yet. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: A number of factors have been identified. These include ecological, social and economic factors, such as the state of degradation (ecological) and the need to rapidly recover endemic-based tree agricultural tree systems (social and economic). Although supportive, the social-economic aspects of the project limit the ability to increase the number of non-commercial species in the first instance.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: By recovering the endemic-based commercially-viable tree systems, the aim is to assist landowners whose livelihoods rely on these species.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: The recover of the tree systems, as noted above, and the removal of dead trees from the fire allows landowners access to timber/fuel-wood. In many instances, not all of the eucalyptus present is being removed, but reduced to manageable sites for timber harvesting and honey production. The recovery of the endemic tree systems should revitalize the water flows as well as support the need for certain food types, such as chestnuts. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: The process of recovery will take time. So recreational, aesthetic and spiritual values as cultural ecosystem services will be restored over time as these are dependent on the continuation of the restoration activities. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: As above, the recovery of regulating services will be over time and dependent on the continuation of the restoration activities. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: The political challenge is to change the mindset of landowners, local council planners and policy-makers as the paradigm for restoring damaged or degraded sites remains firmly entrenched in forestry-based (silvicultural) processes. The PhD study is investigating these processes based on a recent practitioner assessment. Nunes et al. (2016)* claim that ""Restoration efforts in the Mediterranean Basin have been changing from a silvicultural to an ecological restoration approach. Yet, to what extent the projects are guided by ecological restoration principles remains largely unknown 
*Reference - Nunes, A. et al. (2016) Ecological restoration across the Mediterranean Basin as viewed by practitioners. Science of the Total Environment 566–567: 722–732. Nothing yet. The plan in the first instance is to secure funding for these actions which it is envisaged will be the responsibility of GEOTA in cooperation with Nova University and other universities along with landowners, local associations and institutional partners who can provide support for these activities.

Racially discriminatory policies led to the area being neglected by authorities, resulting in the degradation of its ecological integrity. A proposal by the City of Cape Town (COCT) to build a shopping mall on site was defeated by community protest action, which included planting fynbos.The Princess Vlei Forum now works with the COCT to manage the site. The Forum has initiated a five-year restoration project to rehabilitate and restore three vegetation types: Cape Lowlands Freshwater Wetlands (endangered), Cape Flats Dune Strandveld (endangered) and Cape Flats Sand Fynbos (critically endangered). This will enable the conservation of fauna and flora existing on site, reintroduce threatened species that are locally extinct, inspire a new generation of conservationists through practical environmental education, and foster long term community custodianship.  The goal of phase one is to restore 12 hectares. In the first year we have mapped the site, created a restoration plan and doubled the area under active restoration through planting events involving local community members.Agriculture & Livestock, Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological), Dams & Hydrology, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry A habitat condition assessment conducted by the restoration team has established that 80,6% is near natural or degraded and 18% is highly transformed;
Before urban development, the area was used for flower cultivation and as grazing for livestock. Encroaching urban development fragmented the site and isolated it from other systems, and led to interference in the hydrological system, such as canalization of the rivers feeding the vleis; flushing the canals using chemicals; industrial pollutants; sewage leakage; and dredging of the main water body.
In the 1960’s the surrounding areas were declared ‘coloured’ under the apartheid government’s Group Areas Act, and people were forcibly removed there from areas that had been declared white. Princess Vlei was one of the few natural recreational areas that was accessible to people of colour. Because it was not a ‘white recreational area’, it was neglected by the authorities, leading to a degradation of the natural systems on site. This led to a negative feedback loop, which persisted post-apartheid, due to other priorities by the City. For 20 years, the COCT was entertaining a proposal to build a shopping mall there, and did not invest in the area, despite the fact that it was found to have biodiversity value and was declared a biodiversity conservation area in 2012. Fortunately, it is highly valued by local communities for it’s heritage and nature values, and has benefited from community efforts to conserve and restore the vegetation, and the communities sustained and ultimately successful opposition to the mall.
The consequences of this neglect have resulted in secondary causes for degradation such as alien invasive plants; dumping; sand minding; vagrancy and littering.
The degradation of the fynbos has had a detrimental effect in a number of ways has resulted in a low fuel load, leading to inability for fire – this is a problem as fire is a an ecosystem driver for fynbos. Secondary impacts include loss of plant diversity and faunal diversity; erosion and alien invasion. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).The nearest reference sites used to set our restoration goal were divided into the two main the vegetation types found at the Greater Princess Vlei Conservation Area. A North-South sequence of Cape Flats Sand Fynbos conservation areas where studied: Rondebosch Common, Kenilworth Racecourse, Meadowridge Common, and Lower Tokai conservation areas. A concentration of Cape Flats Dune Strandveld conservation areas are towards the South West were studied: Rondevlei, Zeekoevlei and Zandvlei conservation areas. Matching these habitats, with historical botanical records of Princess Vlei pre-transformation, we were able to fine-scale target which communities should be restored to which niche area.
Where applicable, the above sites will be used for seed collection to restore Princess Vlei with structural and composition elements to the habitat.
Further, GPVCA has mostly, critical ecotonal habitat between Cape Flats Sand Fynbos and Cape Flats Dune Strandveld. The most useful reference habitat can be found at Rondevlei Nature Reserve, South East of the GPVCA. Rondevlei has a unique community of both fynbos and strandveld plants. a small section of Rondevlei Nature Reserve has the most similar ecotonal habitat, and thus it is the main reference site. It is home to the only population of the critically endangered proteaceae, the Rondevlei Spiderhead (Serruria foeniculacea). The test planting of this species on site has been incredibly successful. There are high hopes for its introduction, as well as the Extinct in the Wild Erica verticillata, which has been restored there too.
To the North, Kenilworth Racecourse Conservation Area (KRCA) is the most intact reference ecosystem comparable to Princess Vlei’s Fynbos habitats. It is home to various site endemic species, such as Erica margaritacea and Erica verticillata– both of which could be introduced to the GPVCA. To the West are Meadowridge Common, which is highly degraded, and the Lower Tokai Conservation Area, which has undergone extensive active restoration. To the South Zandvlei Estuary has useful reference habitat of Cape Flats Dune Strandveld habitat.
The Northern parts of the conservation area will be restored to Cape Flats Sand Fynbos, whilst the southern parts will be restored to Cape Flats Dune Strandveld. Ecotonal habitat will be restored in between, based on community plant lists observed at Rondevlei conservation area. There are many degraded open spaces to the north and south of the conservation area that have fragments of biodiversity. Whilst these remnant ecosystems are not viable long term conservation areas, the plant biodiversity found there can be used to rehabilitate and restore Princess Vlei. Where possible, degraded areas within 5kms of the Greater Princess Vlei Conservation Area will be rescued from development and translocated to restore the Princess Vlei habitat. These are the primary goals:

Restore ideal ecological functions and ecosystem drivers across habitat types, and controlled eradicate invasive species.
Restore 12 hectares of threatened habitat types (in phase one)
Implement long term measures for managing anthropogenic use of the GPVCA.
Secure species on site with critically low populations.
Implement reintroductions of locally extinct species.
Restore ecological infrastructure on a landscape level, so that it becomes a community asset and attracts custodianship by government and community structures
Improve capacity for custodianship by involving community members and school learners in planting and monitoring the progress of the plants.
To secure long term protection of the site from negative development and degradation by strengthening its status as a provincial heritage site, and ensuring the local authorities fulfil their legal obligations to manage it as a biodiversity site


Monitoring Details: Yes – using a modified Whitaker plot;
Bi-annual monitoring of each node should occur during autumn and spring. This should be complimented with an annual repeat photography exercise, taken diagonally across the node from the North West corner to the South East corner.
Depending on the restoration goal, there are up to four key variables which should be tracked during monitoring:
1.Demographic monitoring of target or indicator species.
2.Vegetation cover and structural composition.
3.Alien invasive plant species recovery and removal.
4.Quantity of plants or seeds actively restored. Start date, including baseline data collection: 2018 -07 End Date: 2024 - 01
Local community:
The Princess Vlei Forum keeps the local community informed of the project  through community meetings and workshops; a regular newsletter; community conservation events such as clean ups, guided walks and planting.
City of Cape Town: The manager employed by the Princess Vlei Forum works closely with City personnel on a daily basis; The PVF has regular scheduled meetings with CoCT officials and ward councilor to discuss aspects of the project.
Local environmental educational  groups and schools: the PVF involves schools and local educators in regular educational events at Princess Vlei.
Scientific conservation community: Members of this community or kept informed through regular meetings, and the participation of the Princess Vlei Forum in conferences such as the Fynbos Forum and National Wetlands Indaba.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: 3 Stars: We are in the ‘secure habitat condition’ phase of the restoration project. We have put in measures to stop and mitigate threats to habitat, and it’s recovery. Areas undergoing immediate restoration, and good condition habitats at risk of damage, have been marked-off. Signage has been erected, and barriers put in place to stop illegal dumping of waste as well as illegal sand mining. All species of alien invasive plants, terrestrial through to aquatic, are being dealt with by species specific management protocols that are being currently implemented.  How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: 3 Stars: The water body on site has been dredged and the shoreline scarified, creating extensive reed beds. Erosion from too frequent fires has flattened sections of the undulating wetland habitat. Work has begun to deal with the shoreline of the waterbody, and reedbeds are now being managed holistically. Terrestrial habitats are in good condition, with the soil profile largely intact. There are low levels of root biomass due to historical devegatation. This will be dealt with whenever a new node is restored. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: 3 Stars: The habitat condition assessment designed for Cape Town lowlands has mapped areas of species richness. Secondarily, plant species in low population numbers have been flagged during the complimentary plant species atlas on site. The ongoing seed banking will ensure areas restored by reseeding will have a representative community composition. Species in critically low population numbers are being propagated at our restoration facility for ‘bulking up’. Many species that historically occurred on site have become locally extinct. All areas that undergo active restoration will have an element of reintroduction. 22 threatened species have been selected for reintroduction, as flagship species for the project. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): 2 Stars: The habitat condition assessment delineates habitat condition areas based on ecosystem structure. All proteoid overstory species, characteristic of the habitat types found on site, have gone locally extinct.  How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): The Restoration areas trialed between 2014-2018 have shown significant outward recruitment of many structural elements of the vegetation type. Two plots have gone from 0% to 80% cover in five years. Firebreaks are being maintained to ensure a proper fire regime is established. In the good condition remnants of habitat, alien invasive plants continue to be removed, to ensure the outward recruitment and passive recovery where possible. Improved reedbed management has led to increased leopard toad breeding sites. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): 2 Stars: All the inlets that recharge the two water bodies are canalised. The ‘Source to Sea’ project is in it’s final planning phase and The Princess Vlei Conservation Area has been highlighted as a receptor area for decanalaisation and stream bank restoration. This will improve the connectivity between conservation areas that fall on the various rivers between source to sea. Many species that can move between sites already use the waterbodies as stopping points. The continued terrestrial restoration will encourage terrestrial bird vifauna to visit and breed site.  Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: The Princess Vlei Forum has an active program to actively involve the community in all aspects of the restoration project. We work closely with school teachers to enable the site to be used in case studies and practical work. We involved school learners in planting, clean ups, alien clearance, and monitoring of species. We have a strong social media presence on Facebook and in our blog posts, and circulated regular newsletters and notices to a database of over 1000 subscribers. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Areas prone to external pollution and risk (dumping, sand mining, etc) have been identified and demarcated with signage and physical barriers. A regular routine has been established to monitor the site for litter.
Reinstate appropriate physical conditions
The shoreline of the water body and reed beds will be sculpted to a more natural bank when areas are rehabilitated. When terrestrial habitats have been cleared, the mildly undulating sands of the habitat have been restored. This has allowed niche communities to establish within the habitat Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: The shoreline of the water body and reed beds will be sculpted to a more natural bank when areas are rehabilitated. When terrestrial habitats have been cleared, the mildly undulating sands of the habitat have been restored. This has allowed niche communities to establish within the habitat. Achieve a desirable species composition: Three overstory wetland species have been reintroduced in the 2019 restoration plots. Since the restoration project (2019), plant communities have been restored on hydrological bands, as well as across them. We have done a test planting of of the Extinct in the Wild Erica verticillata. Reinstate structural diversity: Low habitat condition areas that also have few aliens have been identified and reseeded with ephemeral, annual species. This has helped the passive recovery of many areas and set a bedrock for more sophisticated restoration in future. Recover ecosystem functionality: Fire breaks have been designed, and will be cut this spring, ahead of the fire season. This will allow us to exclude wildfires from areas not ready to burn. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: The conservation area is part of the Western Leopard Toad project. Every spring volunteers assist toads cross roads through the conservation area, as they migrate to their breeding ponds. This has been effective at securing migrating populations of this threatened amphibian. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: We do not have the resources to implement landscape scale restoration at the desired size due to resource limitations. Restoration will thus operation on a smaller, modular basis across site

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The project has generated income generating work through the government's Expanded Public Works Project, providing short term contracts for a number of employees in alien and littering clearance; and preparing ground for planting. 
The Princess Vlei Forum has employed a full time site manager and a part time consultant on the project, and is lobbying the CoCT to create a full time post to manage the biodiversity on the site effectively. 
The CoCT contracts the services of a security company to assist with managing security on the site.
Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: The Princess Vlei provides a critical green lung and natural recreational area, which has already been greatly enhanced by the restoration work to date. The Forum is currently engaged in a process to declare the area a provincial heritage site – the heritage values have been enhanced by restoration work. The site has strong cultural and spiritual value for indigenous groups of Khoe descent, and is used for water immersion baptism by a number of churches. It provides an outdoor classroom for local school children, and a rare opportunity for them to learn about and enjoy nature.  Its value as a green recreational site in a highly urbanised low income community has been greatly enhanced already by the restoration efforts. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: The project ensures the ongoing monitoring of water quality, and clearing the alien growth on the water assists with maintaining freshwater ecosystems; the shoreline maintenance stops erosion; Revegetation enables the area to be used as a carbon sink, and increased ecological function enhances its function as a green lung. Restoration work helps to ensure that the area will be conserved and not paved over in housing or commercial development. The wetland assists in flood prevention. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: No The project has demonstrated the value and necessity of a ‘whole society’ approach, involving government; NGO’s; the Private Sector; community members and experts/specialists. We have established a conservation and restoration committee for all stakeholders and partners to give input to restoration project.  This will not only guide the project, but also help to ensure that it stays on track.
This integrated approach has helped to ensure that for example the City’s maintenance operations such as clearing water hyacinth or mowing are done to minimize ecosystem processes such as leopard toad breeding.
  After the initial five year phase we will enter a new five year phase to extend the restoration area to other parts of the site. In the long term, we are lobbying the CoCT to employ a full term manager – this has been supported by the local City Councillor; CREW will be deployed to take on long term monitoring and surveying; All data will feed into SANBI’s redlist and conservation planning database as well as the CoCT’s Biodiversity Network. There is a management plan and legally binding agreement in place to ensure that the CoCT manages the site as a biodiversity conservation site, and the Princess Vlei Forum is committed to monitoring and ensuring that this happens "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/restoring-degraded-forests-in-uganda/	Restoring degraded forests in Uganda	Uganda	2012-10	2030-12	"Under the Bonn Challenge, Uganda has pledged to restore 2.5 million ha of land by 2020. This pledge represents a huge opportunity for delivering species conservation, increasing biodiversity on farms, and delivering genetically and taxonomically diverse ecological restoration that benefits people and wildlife. Uganda has 849 native tree species; 30 are globally threatened.Tooro Botanical Gardens (TBG) is situated in Fort Portal in Western Uganda. TBG has been working with local communities to bring 52 ha of degraded forest reserves under restoration and operates the largest native tree nursery in Uganda, producing around 40,000 native tree seedlings per year. The first phase of the project brought one Central Forest Reserve and two Local Forest Reserves under restoration, generated information on native species, and established demonstration sites that showcase species diverse forest restoration and provide benefits to neighbouring communities, e.g. through employment.In the second phase of this project, TBG is now scaling up its efforts across Uganda and has established four new indigenous tree nurseries next to areas identified as high priorities for restoration. The project aims to raise awareness of the diversity of native tree species, increase supply of native seedlings and plant native trees in additional degraded areas.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The majority of designated forest reserves in Uganda were cleared, and subsequently planted with non-native species and encroached for agriculture. Many are close to urban areas and this has led to a loss of green spaces for urban dwellers, ecosystem services and biodiversity. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).The TBG team conducted botanical surveys in Kibale Forest National Park, the nearest remaining forest area to the restoration sites. Historical references were also used to supplement survey work, including forestry records and herbarium vouchers. 
To raise awareness of the diversity of native tree species in Uganda
To increase the supply of genetically and species diverse tree seedlings for restoration
To restore degraded forest reserves to benefit biodiversity
To provide employment opportunities for rural communities


Monitoring Details: TBG measures survival rates, height, canopy width and root collar diameter of a sample of trees at all planting sites. These are measured at the end of each rainy season. The average survival rate of seedlings planted out across the restoration sites so far is 83%. Top performing species showed 99% survival in 2018. Start date, including baseline data collection: 2013 End Date: 2030
Rural communities are primary stakeholders in this project, particularly women as they have limited employment opportunities in rural areas. Communities are trained in seed collection, propagation and nursery management skills. Engagement and sensitization of local leaders, NGOs and government,  and school and higher education groups, has been a key component of work at TBG. Forest restoration training courses are also offered by TBG.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: To avoid further encroachment at sites, communities are involved in restoration activities, e.g. offered employment and allowed to plant leguminous vegetables in between young trees. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: Planting of native species to improve soil conditions and reduce run-off. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: An average of 80 native tree species are planted at each site. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Planting of framework species to attract seed dispersers. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): The sites improve connectivity to other forest patches. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: Community involvement in nurseries and planting activities, which helped gain support from neighbouring communities. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Encroachment at planted sites greatly reduced throughout the project timeframe. Local people also planted native trees in their homesteads to remove pressure on planted resources. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: Increased canopy cover and decreased soil erosion. Achieve a desirable species composition: An average of 80 native tree species are planted at each site. Reinstate structural diversity: The diversity of birds recorded at the TBG site increased significantly. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: At some sites continuing community engagement is required to ensure long-term success of planting efforts.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: TBG supplied communities neighbouring restoration sites with desirable seedlings free of charge (over 41,000 seedlings were distributed over the duration of the project). 
The four new nurseries established are employing 60 people as seed collectors and 40 people as nursery workers (overall).
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: The diversity of native tree species given to communities provide them with fruit and other Non Timber Forest Products. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: The project has improved the aesthetic value of the forest reserves. It is envisaged that these areas will be used for recreation in future. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: Reduced soil erosion through tree planting. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: Communities were previously using the sites for cultivation, but this was illegal. Initial adverse feelings towards the project interventions were mitigated through outreach, employment of local community members, e.g. in nurseries, has enhanced community support for the project. 
Different community engagement processes are required at different sites
The project was helpful for determining the propagation techniques and growing requirements for different species, many of which had never been propagated before
Careful communication is required during the site clearance phase, i.e. to inform people of the long-term objectives of the project
 Restoration work was carried out in collaboration with local forest offices, who are responsible for long-term management of the sites. Engagement with policymakers throughout the first phase of the project has also paved the way for the expansion of restoration activities to other areas. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/rangeland-rehabilitation-through-invasive-species-management-in-laikipia-kenya/	Rangeland rehabilitation through invasive species management in Laikipia, Kenya	Kenya	2018-09	N/A	"Opuntia stricta is a problematic invasive cactus species in many of the world’s drylands, including Laikipia, Kenya (Shackleton et al., 2017). This project focuses on Makurian Group Ranch, a communally managed rangeland in the Mukogodo area of Laikipia. The members of this Maasai community are pastoralists whose livelihoods depend on livestock husbandry and the O. stricta invasion is perceived as a more serious threat than insufficient grazing (Shackleton et al., 2017). A biological control agent, Dactylopius opuntiae (cochineal), was released several years ago and there was a campaign to grow and cultivate D. opuntiae in a greenhouse so that colonised cladodes could be placed on O. stricta manually to accelerate the spread of the biological control agent. Unfortunately, this project ended when the funding ran out and the spread of D. opuntiae has been very slow. As funding is limited and local communities are strongly motivated to control O. stricta, manual clearing has been proposed by the group ranch members despite its labour intensiveness. The group ranch members compose the vast majority of the stakeholders and have driven this restoration project from conception, through planning and implementation and, in later stages of the project, will lead the monitoring and evaluation.Agriculture & Livestock, Climate Change, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) The primary cause of degradation in Makurian Group Ranch and the wider Mukogodo area is the spread of the invasive alien cactus species, O. stricta. Since its introduction to the Mukogodo area in the 1950s, O. stricta spread to an area of 3,200 hectares in 2006, 4,800 hectares in 2008 and 66,200 hectares by 2014 (Strum et al., 2015), now covering 50-75% of the rangelands (Shackleton et al., 2017). O. stricta is dispersed by wildlife (particularly elephant and baboon) and human activity. However, the rapid acceleration of the spread of O. stricta after a lag of over 50 years is more strongly driven by human population growth and the increase in sedentarisation of previously more mobile pastoral communities that reside in the area over recent decades, beginning in the 1997-1998 high rainfall El Niño event. This has led to increased livestock grazing pressure, which, together with increasing frequency and intensity of droughts (Kaye-Zwiebel & King, 2014), has led to a state transition from savanna grassland to degraded rangeland with much bare ground (Strum et al., 2015). The increased prevalence of bare ground is likely to be the proximate cause of the spread of O. stricta, while climatic factors, population growth, sedentarisation, grazing pressure, erosion of customary institutions to manage common property natural resources and the inability to secure land (e.g. against grazing incursions from neighbouring communities) are underlying causal drivers. One of the main impacts of O. stricta is on livestock health (mouth sores, weight loss, general sickness, less milk, death, gastro-intestinal tract issues etc.) and associated negative impacts on livelihoods. In a recent study, almost half of the 200 respondents reported annual losses of USD 500-1,000 (Shackleton et al., 2017). Other impacts include human health (eye and skin irritation from glochids on the fruit), reduced mobility of humans and livestock, restricted access to grass (livestock forage), contraction of grazing area, loss of useful plants (primarily medicinal) and negative impacts on wildlife populations (Shackleton et al., 2017). The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Sites in the landscape that are less severely invaded provide useful extant reference ecosystems, such as those that have lower grazing pressure (e.g. conservation areas, livestock exclosure plots, areas cleared of O. stricta). As the changes in the ecosystem are relatively recent (major alterations occurring within the past 10-20 years), there is also ample local knowledge and social memory of the ecological state prior to the accelerated spread of O. stricta. The main indicator or key attribute that will be monitored is the density of O. stricta and, ideally, the restored system will be free of O. stricta (failing that, minimised as much as possible). We decided on these reference conditions rather than, for example, a system that would be representative of the landscape 50 or more years ago due to irreversible changes (or changes that are impractical to reverse) such as human population growth and increased livestock numbers. The project’s primary ecological goal is to minimise and, if possible, completely eradicate (locally) O. stricta and the main socio-economic goal is to improve the livelihoods of the resident Maasai pastoral communities. The latter includes human and livestock health, livestock production and household income. Meeting the ecological goal of minimising O. stricta prevalence will enable the socio-economic goals to be achieved and improving livelihoods will facilitate O. stricta management (e.g. by facilitating financial investment in restoration work) so the two goals are closely interrelated. These two goals will improve the state of the rangelands, in turn benefiting wildlife, which is a further intention of the project.

Monitoring Details: Assessing the prevalence (in this case, area occupied) and density of O. stricta and the socio-economic impacts are the main indices to be monitored. The former will be performed through systematic geo-referenced transects and photographic evidence and the latter will be undertaken via interviews and focus group discussions. Start date, including baseline data collection: March 2019 End Date: ongoing
The primary stakeholders are the community members of the Makurian Group Ranch within the Mukogodo area. The community is composed of pastoral peoples, the majority of whom are of Maasai ethnicity. The facilitator is a PhD student from a neighbouring property. The Makurian community members conceived the project and defined the project’s focus, goals and methodology. The elders and livestock grazing committee, which is composed representatives from each area of the group ranch, led the mobilisation of their constituency. The members of each constituency collectively decided which areas to focus restoration efforts and what approach to use (e.g. how to manage O. stricta). The facilitator is charged with raising funding (e.g. for equipment) and researching similar restoration efforts both nationally and internationally to enable learning from other projects. A member of the Makurian community acts as both a Maa-English interpreter and a facilitator to ensure constant communication and coordinates among all stakeholders.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: The threat to the social-ecosystem to be addressed is the control of the invasive cactus, O. stricta. However, it is crucial that controlling O. stricta occurs in conjunction with rangeland management practices that facilitate the establishment of grasses and other herbaceous vegetation to reduce bare ground, thus preventing recolonisation by O. stricta. Areas with good vegetation cover are less impacted by the spread of O. stricta (Strum et al., 2015; personal observation). How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: Although conducting surveys of substrate and hydrology are not feasible under the current budget, if we are successful in applications to further grant funding, physical conditions of the rangeland in response to restoration work (particularly soil erosion rates) can be assessed. In many areas in Makurian Group Ranch, cut O. stricta are being used to fill erosion gullies, where their growth and establishment are tolerated as they perform soil and water conservation functions and are not competing with grazing land. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: The absence of O. stricta, or the minimisation of its prevalence, is the main aim regarding species composition. The grasses and other herbaceous plant species (e.g. for forage or medicine) important for local pastoral livelihoods are still present within the landscape (often growing among O. stricta). Therefore, these species are not at risk and will be able to reestablish in areas cleared of O. stricta under appropriate management. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Reinstating structural diversity is not a primary focus of this project as the focus is on removing undesired species rather than introducing lost species. However, as the native flora persist between individual O. stricta we expect that, with appropriate management, native flora will re-establish after clearing the cactus. Therefore, post-restoration, areas that are currently dominated by O. stricta will experience greater evenness rather than species richness. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Regarding nutrient cycling, as mentioned above, cut O. stricta are being used to fill erosion gullies, where they perform soil and water conservation functions. This means that the nutrients are largely kept within the system. Moreover, the O. stricta growing within the gullies is more productive (and sequesters more carbon) than the alternative bare ground. O. stricta fruit can safely be consumed and the cladodes can be fed to livestock when forage is limited (e.g. during droughts) after the spines are removed (or fed directly to camels without removing the spines). The resulting reduction in soil erosion also prevents nutrients from leaving the system. Rather than re-establishing lost plant-animal interactions, this project focuses more on reducing the relatively recently formed relationships between O. stricta and elephants, baboons and livestock as the cactus' dispersing agents. Finally, increasing access to grazing land by controlling O. stricta will make the local pastoral community more resilient to stressors such as droughts. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Regarding hydrology, the restoration interventions in this project aim to reduce the loss of water from the system (e.g. via runoff or evaporation). The immediate effect of removing O. stricta will be to expose soil to higher runoff and evaporation rates, but this will be ameliorated under appropriate management after one or two rainy seasons when native vegetation establishes. Herbaceous cover of even 50% reduces the majority of water-induced erosion in these systems. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: As mentioned above, O. stricta has several negative socio-economic impacts. These are either direct (e.g. human health) or indirect (e.g. livestock health, livestock products and income). Therefore, removing O. stricta will have positive impacts on the livelihoods of the pastoral communities within Makurian Group Ranch.  These communities, like many pastoral communities, socially and politically marginalised so the financial implications of investing in restoration is a major barrier. Consequently, we are applying for grant funding to cover the cost of necessary equipment (e.g. wheelbarrows, hoes, machetes, spades, rakes) and food for individuals volunteering their time to undertake restoration work. Volunteering is a key aspect of this project. One of the lessons from past experience and the experience of other restoration projects in Kenya and in other countries is that paying community members for restoration work can compromise the viability of the restoration work in the long term (Wells, in review). This may be due to the economic phenomenon termed 'crowding out'. When community members are paid to conduct restoration work they may not be motivated to continue when the funding runs out. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: As the project is in its early stages, thus far, small areas have been cleared of O. stricta as pilot restoration sites in six of the worst affected parts of Makurian Group Ranch. These activities were conducted at the end of the dry season and the re-vegetation of the sites after the next rainy season will be monitored over the coming months. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: As mentioned above, monitoring this aspect of the project is currently beyond the budget of the project. However, qualitative observations will be made of the effectiveness of O. stricta in controlling soil erosion in gullies. Achieve a desirable species composition: In the areas that have been cleared, the species composition is desirable in the sense that O. stricta has been removed and native vegetation remains. However, we await the increase in cover of native vegetation in response to the next rainy season. Reinstate structural diversity: The species richness of sites in which O. stricta has been cleared have not been altered as yet, but we hope to see colonisation of native plants after the next rainy season. Recover ecosystem functionality: Unfortunately, the effects of clearing O. stricta on ecosystem functionality have not been quantified due to lack of funding and because the project is in its early stages. However, we hope to monitor the impacts of restoration work, particularly on plant-animal interactions. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: Again, we have not been able to monitor exchanges with surroundings (e.g. hydrology), but these can be inferred through changes in native vegetation cover. Funding-permitting, we would also like to monitor these effects (particularly on runoff, evaporation and transpiration). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The project is still in its early stages, but a key limitation at present is the lack of funding. We have mentioned monitoring that could be performed with extra funding, but what the stakeholders value more highly are the tools to facilitate the restoration work. Some tools have been purchased, but still far short of the requirements for the larger scale efforts required to manage O. stricta at the scale of the whole group ranch. Communities and women's groups within the group ranch are highly motivated to control O. stricta.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: As the project is in its early stages, this is yet to be evaluated. However, the project is expected to have positive effects on pastoral livelihoods by improving livestock health and production and thus household income.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: As the project is in its early stages, this is yet to be evaluated. Clearing O. stricta should improve the provision of livestock products such as milk and meat. One innovative household is fermenting the pulp from ground O. stricta cladodes and collecting the methane as a fuel source. If this biogas production is popular and viable among other families, its implementation will improve access to cooking fuel and reduce pressure on woody vegetation and the time and effort required for firewood collection. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: As the project is in its early stages, this is yet to be evaluated. However, a collection of several women's groups keen to preserve Maasai culture has cleared an area of O. stricta. This area is now used for traditional ceremonies and is also used for performing traditional dances for tourists, which not only created cultural value but also created a source of income. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: As the project is in its early stages, this is yet to be evaluated. The re-vegetation by native flora after O. stricta is cleared and after one or two rainy seasons will reduce soil erosion after an initial increase (due to exposure of bare ground when O. stricta is cleared). O. stricta in gullies will reduce the force of water runoff, but the extent to which this reduces the impact of flooding is unknown. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: As the project is in its early stages, this is yet to be evaluated. One of the major challenges with restoration work in this area is the inability of group ranches and community conservancies to prevent members of neighbouring communities grazing their livestock. This greatly reduces the incentive to carry out restoration interventions, not only because other members of the community benefit from ones own work, but also members of neighbouring communities may also benefit. One of the advantages of the approach of this project is that a large proportion of the able-bodied individuals participate in the voluntary restoration work, which reduces the risk of feeling that others from the same community are benefiting without contributing. However, grazing incursions from neighbouring communities remains a persistent issue. As many others have experienced, widespread voluntary participation has been a great strength. Not only do participants feel ownership over the project (as they are driving each stage from conception to methodology, implementation and monitoring and evaluation), but there is less of a sentiment that others are benefiting without themselves contributing. One area in which restoration actions were not performed was due to divisions in the community (on religious grounds) and lack of communication and coordination, leading to very few people turning up to clear O. stricta. All other areas so far have coordinated well and have worked hard to clear O. stricta, which highlights the importance of good communication and coordination (particularly in communally managed land). Women’s groups were the most effective at coordinating and carrying out restoration work and this was readily admitted by the male members of the group ranch. An important lesson from this project is that as the community identified the issue as key, the motivation to act to address the issue was strong, so even low level of facilitation (organising meetings and providing a few useful tools) led to very active and effective restoration work. Another advantage of the project being community-led and voluntary is that monitoring and long-term maintenance are easier in comparison to donor-funded and externally driven projects. Some communities within Makurian Group Ranch have defined larger areas to clear O. stricta from and are steadily making progress by organising male and female restoration working groups, each of which contributes two days per week. Individuals are generally between 20-45 years-old and are not forced to work, contributing as much or as little work as they like on their allotted working days. The restoration work days tend to be relaxed affairs, the women often accompanied by young children, the older ones often helping where they can. Arrangements of this type are often coordinated by the elders of each area and are the mode in which restoration work is continued over the long term. The main limitation remains the lack of tools and protective equipment such as gloves and overalls to protect against the gochids, which cause skin irritation. But, we hope to raise funding to purchase more equipment to facilitate the restoration efforts and scale-up the O. stricta clearing. As the effectiveness and consequences of the restoration methods used become clear, adaptive management will no doubt be employed to adjust restoration activities. For example, burning and filling gullies are the two main ways in which cut O. stricta cladodes are treated. The consequences of these methods and how they compare to other existing (biogas production, other biological control agents, selling or producing juices/jams/wines from the fruit) or as yet unconceived methods will guide future restoration actions.

South Africa	4 March 2019	not determined yet	"The Onrus peatland is dominated by the plant palmiet (Prionium serratum), an endemic plant to Southern Africa and the only species in its family. This unchannelled valley-bottom wetland is 33ha in size and is situated near the coastal town of Hermanus, South Africa (Lat: -34.389527 & Lon: 19.227932.  The Onrus wetland is underlain with peat and plays an important role in climate change mitigation.  The Onrus catchment is home to the water supply dam of the town of Hermanus.   The wetland is situated on the Camphill School’s property- a school for disadvantaged and physically impaired children.  The Onrus wetland is upstream of the Onrus estuary – a key nursery ground for fish and recreational activities.  A subsurface peat fire has been threathening the wetland since 11 January 2019.  After various conventional fire fighting methods; an innovative technique is currently being implemented to extinguish the subsurface fire – with great success.  The wetland will be assessed post fire to determine the extent of rehabilitation interventions required to restore functionality to the wetland and protect the intact and undisturbed section of wetland.Agriculture & Livestock, Dams & Hydrology, Fire & Weather Events, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) The Western Cape experienced one of its worst droughts in decades.  The drought had a significant impact on water levels across the Province.  The Onrus wetland is situated below the main water supply dam of the town of Hermanus.  The wetland is also largely affected by mature stands of Blue gum trees, invasive to South Africa.  Historical flow impediments along with the impact of alien invasive species resulted in dried out peat and a head cut migrating upstream into the wetland.  It is also apparent that previous fires have occurred in the wetland.  On 11 January 2019 a fire swept through the Onrus wetland.  The dry conditions and blue gum debris on the floor of the wetland created the perfect environment for a sub-surface fire to take alight.
The Peat have been burning subsurface since 11 January 2019.  The fire is hazard to the neighbouring Camphill School.  Children have been evacuated from the grounds and moved to safer location in the town of Hermanus as there has been respiratory conditions reported – especially in the early hours of the mornings.  Aside from the school being affected; the wetland is also a recreational corridor for cyclists and hikers making it dangerous for them to pass through.  Furthermore the public road on the Eastern boundary of the wetland is under threat of collapsing.  Previous fires have already led to maintenance work being carried out on the road.
The unburned wetland (24 ha in extent) had the following characteristics during the assessments: a. the vegetation was dominated by palmiet.b. Wetland soils were dominated by peat of up to 7.25 m. The upper peat profile was palmiet peat with the lower part (2.5 to 7.25 m) dominated by sedge-radicell peat. Sand was located at the bottom of the peat profile except towards the centre of the basin where the peat profile was deeper than the available sampling extensions. C. A 1 to 2m wide furrow was evident in this section feeding into the active head cut in this unburnt section dominated by palmiet.d. Low water levels were noted in the furrow with the levels 20 to 40 cm below the peat surface in the palmiet.e. Two diversion furrows were noted, feeding water across the width of the peatland and maintaining relatively high levels of inundation at the burning front (Figure 5).5. Therefore, having considered the abovementioned factors it is concluded that. This is a palmiet peatland in an unchannelled valley bottom HGM setting. It contains peat of more than 7.25 m thick, dominated by a lower thick sedge layer with a basal sand and not bedrock layer. This palmiet peatland is therefore unlike other palmiet systems and. The wetland is under severe threat of further degradation as it has been drained, eroded, the peat desiccated, and burned with AIP’s colonising degraded parts. As soon as the subsurface fires are extinguished the wetland should be rehabilitated to prevent further erosion and re-wet the peatland, under the supervision of a competent authority.
Note: Due to the drought the release of large volumes of water from the upstream dam was not an option.  Alternative solutions had to be identified in the feat to stop the raging fire. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).This will be done in detail once full scope of Rehabilitation planning is in force. 
Short term goal:


Extinguish the fire under the constraint of not having large volumes of water available due to the continued drought within the Western Cape.
Source and Allocate funding towards detailed wetland rehabilitation planning (post fire).


Medium term


Awareness and Custodianship by local community and users.
Source funding for implementation of the Wetland Rehabilitation plan for the Onrus wetland system.
Initiate implementation of the Rehabilitation plan eg. Stabilise head cut with a structural intervention to stop further erosion upstream into the intact wetland
Clear and manage invasive tree species


Long term


Maintenance and monitoring of wetland rehabilitation
Re-wetting and
Landscaping to allow for natural vegetation to return and soil structure to be returned to the area affected by the fire
Restore functionality of the wetland.


Monitoring Details: No formal monitoring plan is in place although FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared) imagery has been taken with a drone before firefighting activities commenced to determine hot spots within the wetland.  The monitoring is continued during the fire fighting intervention to monitor success of the firefighting phase of the project.  The FLIR imagery assisted to plan the fire fighting intervention as the wetland is not safe to walk through while burning subsurface.  
Furthermore should funding be awarded a WET-Health assessment will be completed before further rehabilitation work.  WET-Health describes the wetland condition based on hydrology, geomorphology and vegetation.  The data will be used to measure the success of rehabilitation activities implemented. Start date, including baseline data collection: FLIR data was taken by Enviro Wildfire Services at their own expense approximately two months after the fire started to burn. End Date: FLIR data will continue until the fire has been extinguished 100% WET-Health monitoring and other associated monitoring will be set up at coordinated intervals pre and post rehabilitation.
Overstrand Municipality Coordinated efforts to extinguish the subsurface fire and supports further rehabilitation
Working on Fire Programme:  Deployed a team of 20 fire fighters to extinguish the subsurface fire by using a newly developed method for peat fires.  A spike tool with multiple nozzles that is pushed into the soil and pushes water subsurface to roughly 1.5m.  It is estimated that the fire should be extinguished completely by the second week of June 2019.
Working for Wetlands Programme: Conducted the initial assessments of the wetland and problem assessment.  Made recommendations and will assess the wetland after the fire has been extinguished to determine the extent of rehabilitation required for wetland function to be maintained upstream as well as what to be done in the area affected by the fire.  The Working for Wetlands Programme has already scheduled the initial phase but requires funding to assist with a complete rehabilitation plan and
Eviro Wildfire fighting service provider.  Enviro Wildfire Services have been using a drone fitted with an infrared camera and self-funded the monitoring activity whilst sharing the imagery to be used in assessing the extent and intensity of the subsurface peat fire.  This technology has not been applied on subsurface fires within South Africa before.  It has been invaluable use to plan the fire fighting activities and monitor progress accordingly.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/restoring-abandoned-salt-pans-as-a-waterbird-habitat/	Restoring abandoned salt pans as a waterbird habitat.	South Africa	2019-01	2024-01	"A solar saltworks at Swartkops Estuary, Port Elizabeth (Eastern Cape, South Africa) was abandoned in 2018 due to the continuous theft and vandalism of the infrastructure. While operational, the salt pans were utilized diverse waterbird communities (of resident and migrant species), and formed an integral component of the Swartkops Global Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA). The salt pans were particularly important for providing safe nesting sites for resident species in the form of salt marsh islands isolated from mammalian predators and humans. These islands supported some of the largest breeding colonies of various species (such as Caspian terns, white-breasted cormorants and kelp gulls) in southern Africa. However, the pans have been left to dry and consequently bird abundance and diversity has greatly decreased, leaving this previously diverse ecosystem depauperate.A local non-profit organization and conservation establishment, the Zwartkops Conservancy, along with Cerebos (the previous operating company) are currently planning to restore the salt pans with the main management objective of habitat provision for waterbirds. This entails filling the dry pans with water seasonally so as to coincide with the breeding season of resident birds (during the austral winter). Various options are currently being explored to accomplish this. Among these options are opportunities for treating polluted stormwater and incorporating small local businesses into the restoration. Additionally, the restoration of the site will assist the Conservancy’s efforts to safeguard the IBA status as well as their plans to have the Swartkops Estuary awarded with a Ramsar wetland designation. With the increasing abandonment of salt pans, both in South Africa and abroad, this project will also aim to inspire and produce valuable lessons for similar cases of restoration in the future.Dams & Hydrology, Mining & Resource Extraction While operational, the salt pans, although an man-made ecosystem, were a hotspot for biodiversity (particularly waterbirds through the provision of safe nesting sites). However, the pans have now dried up, leaving behind a large area of depauperate land. Recent bird counts and site visits have revealed that all but one colony of sacred ibis have not returned to nest at the pans since abandonment last year.
Among the birds found at the pans are various Palearctic migrant species that overwinter in the area. The global loss of wetlands and decline in waterbird numbers is a regional and international issue that can be addressed through local actions regarding the management and restoration of wetlands. There is much potential in creating and maintaining artificial wetland systems that provide important habitats for migratory birds.
Saltworks are in decline locally and globally, leaving behind large areas of hypersaline and derelict land. Saltworks restoration projects are likely to become more common. However, little to none such projects have taken place in South Africa. This project will explore various options for restoring the pans, including the potential for economic gain, and inform and inspire other similar restoration initiatives in South Africa through providing insights in a regional/national context. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on historical information about ecological attributes at the site prior to degradation.This project focuses on restoring the hydrology of the salt pans. The pans lie several meters above sea level, so water was actively pumped into them prior to abandonment. The project is exploring different mechanisms for pumping water into these pans to manage them as a waterbird hotspot. It is necessary to restore this artificially managed hydrology to provide suitable breeding islands for the many waterbird species that used to frequent the area. The vision of the restored site is one of high waterbird diversity and abundance. Thus, bird counts will be the primary indicator of restoration success. A comprehensive, long-term dataset already exists thanks to the ongoing Coordinated Waterbird Counts (CWAC) programme. Ideally, the restored area will host similar bird communities (in terms of numbers and diversity) as the past, when the pans when the pans were a nationally and internationally important waterbird habitat. This project aims to restore the defunct salt pans such that a satisfactory amount of IBA trigger (waterbird) species return to the area, and to assist with the area (and adjacent estuary) to be designated as a Ramsar wetland of international importance.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Zwartkops Conservancy are the primary stakeholders. The Conservancy is currently planning the actions to be taken, and funding thereof, for restoring the area. Their interests lie in safeguarding the area as a Global IBA and to have it designated as a Ramsar wetland. Public participation will commence once further plans have been made among the responsible parties.

How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: It is planned to restore an artificially managed hydrologic regime to the degraded area. Various ways of accomplishing this are currently being explored, such as pumping water via a pump on a floating pontoon, or constructing a windmill. Another option is to pump water from an artificial wetland that is currently receiving too much stormwater to properly treat, and to use one of the pans as a treatment pond before the water is released into the adjacent Swartkops Estuary. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: The project's primary aim is to restore the abundance and diversity of waterbirds to reflect past conditions (before the salt pans were abandoned). How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): The hydrologic function of the pans will be restored, reinstating the stressors and functions that were previously acting in the area. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): The study site is notably used by various Palearctic migrant waterbird species, which are already under high pressure from habitat loss and degradation. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: Various economic opportunities for local communities will be explored for incorporation into this restoration project. As the project is still in the early stages of planning, it remains flexible for many different socio-economic opportunities. Among these are creating and maintaining a popular bird watching area with guides from local communities, aquaculture, and less obvious circular Blue Economy possibilities. As the project is still in the early stages of planning, these details have not yet been confirmed. However, Cerebos, as the operating entity, are responsible for the rehabilitation of the area. The activities, and duration thereof, are yet to be confirmed by the national Department of Mineral Resources. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/buwerimwe-secondary-school-forest-reforestation-project-marange-communal-area/	Buwerimwe Secondary School Forest Reforestation Project (Marange Communal Area)	Zimbabwe	2017-01	2027-12	"19°23’20.5″S 32°15’53.2″E Mutare https://goo.gl/maps/gzBdAfWZPHnMarange is in Zimbabwe’s Natural Region IV. The region receives annual rainfall of about 650mm and is erratic. Temperatures can reach highs of 35 degrees Celsius during most part of the year. These climatic conditions make it difficult for meaningful crop production to take place, worsening the livelihoods and food security in the area, leaving forests as the only livelihood option.
The restoration project is located at Buwerimwe Secondary School. The goal is to restore forests lost to deforestation by involving both community and students in the project. Expected outcomes will include, increase in vegetation cover, raising a generation of students who are environmentally sensitive and custodians of the environment, control erosion, create a source of nectar for future bee keeping projects, provide habitat for wild animals and have a pilot project which if successful will be used to implement similar projects in schools and communities in Zimbabwe.
A total of two thousand trees have been planted since 2017. Water Shortages and fencing have been the major challenges. Students are now bringing water from home and the community is being sensitized on the need to stop grazing livestock on the restoration site.Agriculture & Livestock, Climate Change, Deforestation, Fire & Weather Events Cutting down of trees to meet the Community’s energy (firewood, lighting), furniture and construction needs are the main causes of deforestation. Harsh climatic condition over the years has hindered the ability of forests to rejuvenate. This coupled with overgrazing has left the land heavily degraded. In 2005 Chief Mazwi allocated the already degraded area to Buwerimwe Secondary School to construct a school. The school further cleared land for construction of school structures and school sporting arenas. This further worsened the situation. Due to lack of funds the school has not been able to construct structures as planned, leaving all the large pieces of land they had cleared bare and exposed to water and wind erosion. In addition, a lack of proper fencing of the school premises has seen community members continue to graze their livestock in the school yard, putting pressure on the already stressed vegetation, resulting in further degradation.
Ecological Effects
The land is characterised by gullies slicing the landscape into different fragments, lack of vegetation cover. It is covered mainly by grass with few bushes and trees. A lack of vegetation cover to aid infiltration results in the land being flooded the few times when the area receives heavy rains. This has also seen classes being disrupted when water gets into classrooms. The gullies continue to widen and expand towards the school buildings putting the school structures at risk of being swept away in future if the situation is not controlled.
Socio economic effects
In the past when the area was still forested, it used to house small game such as hares and kudus and edible worms, fruits wild vegetables that used to contribute to the community’s nutrition needs. Absence of forests has seen the reduction in game numbers and extinction of the much sought-after Mopane worm. Beekeeping and honey production have also slowed down due to lack of foraging plants for bees, resulting in loss of income for the majority of the unemployed community members who depended on bees as a livelihood option. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on historical information about ecological attributes at the site prior to degradation.Prior to restoration efforts the area was mostly dominated with grass and a few bushes. Grass will be mostly dominant during the rainy season and wilts and dries off during the dry season. The dry grass made the area prone to veld fires summer times. After restoration efforts started, the area has close to 2000 new trees growing.
Restored system will be:
• Increase in tree population density.
• Increase in the number of animals, birds and insect species coming back to the area.
• Closing of gullies and reduction in soil erosion
• Increase in the number of community members and students involved in the project.
Climatic conditions were used to select species planted. Marange experiences high temperatures and low rainfall. Thus drought resistant trees were selected for restoration efforts. Also, to ensure trees adapt easily, species that used to occupy the same area were the ones that were planted.
Due to long dry spells and shortages of irrigation water at the school, students now bring water from their respective homes to irrigate trees. Also all plated trees have been mulched to reduce evaporation. Goal
Forest landscape restoration at Buwerimwe Secondary School.
Objectives
• Plant at least 5000 trees at Buwerimwe Secondary School.
• Promote conservation of forest resources via awareness campaigns.
• Establish a source of tree seeds for future restoration activities and fruits and edible vegetables to meet nutritional needs of the school and community.
Grow more tree saplings in the recently constructed Marange Nursery. This will aid in building upon a lot of work that is underway.

Job creation


Monitoring Details: Monitoring  include checking : growth rate, survaival rate of trees, new animals,birds and insects coming back into the area.  Students and local community along with EBZ are monitoring the plantings. Start date, including baseline data collection: September 2017 End Date: 2027
Stakeholders
1. Ministry of Environment, Tourism and Hospitality Industry acts as the regulatory and advisory body of all the environment related projects. It is the parent Ministry that is supporting EBZ and ensures that it operates within the boundaries of the environmental laws: Environment Act, Forestry Act, etc.
The Ministry has already given Environmental Buddies Zimbabwe the permission to operate in Manicaland Provinces and acknowledge their presence in the Province and is constantly working on connecting us to other relevant stakeholders.
2. Zimbabwe Forestry Commission
In this projects Forestry Commission is offering EBZ technical support. This include:
• Soil testing
• Irrigation water testing
• Advise on medium (soil) to be used in the nursery for saplings.
• Selecting trees that are viable for the Marange hot climate
• Compiling Tree profiles
• Seed collection and storage
• Extension work in the community (Education and awareness)
• Provide monitoring and evaluation advice
3. The role of Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education in this project is to issue an approval and directive to head of schools and colleges to allow the involvement of the students in the afforestation program. In this Project the Ministry has already given EBZ the permission to partner with Buwerimwe Secondary School in Marage to work on this Forest Landscape Restoration Project.
• Buwerimwe Secondary School Teachers; teachers are serving as patrons or an adviser to the students. They also communicate with both the Students and Environmental Buddies Zimbabwe on the goals, objectives and the overall involvement of the school in the project.
• Students; The students are important key actors on this project. Through them the information and knowledge gained at school about the project is being passed to the community. In addition, also take part in activities such as seed collection, practical work at the nursery, guided research on plant species and help collect and compile traditional/ indigenous knowledge on trees from their respective families.
4. Traditional Leaders and Community: Traditional leaders oversees all activities that happen in the communal areas. They approve the project and add their input on how best the project will be executed as they are knowledgeable about the community. They are the ones who also allocate land for the project. They also mobilise the community to accept and participate in the project. They also mobilise human resources they see fit for the project.
The Marange community is very important on this project. They are the final recipient of the project and they are also the host community for the project. The community is a source for indigenous knowledge on forests, they are also helping with collection of seeds. they are also involved in educating other community members on the goals and objectives of the project. Community also provides the workforce needed for the project.
5. Global Greengrants
EBZ received its first grant from Global Green Grants Fund. The fund went towards construction of the Tree Nursery in Marange. The Nursery measures 260m2 and has a capacity to carry over 20 000 tree saplings. To date EBZ has managed to raise over 5000 tree seedlings in this nursery. 2 000 of the trees that were planted at Buwerimwe Secondary School came from this Nursery.
6. USDA Forest Service
United States Forest Survive International Program (USFS IP) has been providing EBZ with technical support. The support includes trainings done in Zimbabwe on various aspects of Forests landscape restoration activities on species selection, improving genes, soil and water testing. They also have been providing EBZ with nursery pots and trays that durable and saves on the soil medium used. In addition, they also provide EBZ with nursery Equipment such as pH testing equipment that has helped in improving the soil medium used in the nursery. Also, callipers that are used to track growth of trees by measuring tree truck diameters.
Besides the equipment, USFS IP has financed one EBZ staff member to attend a Forest Landscape program in Oregon USA in 2018. Information learnt from the Exchange Program has helped EBZ improve its nursery activities and new ways to engage community members into the Marange Restoration Program.
Education and awareness Strategies
Community awareness initiatives are being conducted to increase the reach of the program. Several awareness meetings were conducted with schools namely Buwerimwe Secondary School, Chikuku Primary School, Chigonda Primary School, and Mafunde Primary School. In addition, EBZ collaborated with Mutsago United Methodist Church to carry out an awareness and tree planting programme. The awareness programmes managed to directly reach out to 4000 people
EBZ in partnership with Buwerimwe have managed to establish and Environmental Club at the school, which is still in its infancy stage. The main aim is to train and raise green ambassadors for both the school and communities. The club raises awareness on sustainable forest resources management in neighbouring schools and community. They also do exchange visits with the schools to share forests ideas.
Students at Buwerimwe and other neigbouring Schools have been involved in several tree planting activities, including after tree planting care such as watering and pruning the tree. In addition, students are now using the newly constructed nursery for their hands-on practical lessons in Geography and Agriculture classes.
Community members have also participated in tree planting activities at Buwerimwe Secondary school since 2017. In addition, EBZ had a Bee-keeping and Beading workshop with the community to sensitise them on the importance of non-timber products as livelihood options.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Existing threat: Deforestation

•Seed collection
•Raising tree nurseries
•Land preparation at the out-planting area
•Tree planting
•After tree planting care.
•Capacity building and awareness campaigns How this project achieved a desirable species composition: A total of 50 different indigenous species were selected and used for the restoration efforts. 
1) Hardwoods such as Pod Mahogany for firewood, furniture and construction.
2) Nectar trees such as Sausage tree amd Miomba to promote bee keeping and support bee populations
3) Fast growing tree such as Kenyan Croton for firewood
4) Mophane, African Ebony to promote Mophane worm production to meet proten needs of school and community
5) Fruit trees to meet nutrutuional needs of students How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Plants that ranges from grasses such as Vetiva grass to succulents such as sisal and alloy to large trees such as Pod Mahogany were all included in the restoration efforts. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: Job creation:
 •EBZ has employed one full time nursery assistant.
•EBZ has employed one full time employee for working on the Buwerimwe Secondary School Woodlot. He works with the help of students and staff members.
•Various community members are contracted to pick seeds and supply top-soil whenever they are needed. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Planting trees has reduced the threat of both wind and water erosion. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: A total of 50 different indigenous species have been planted. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Water, enough water to irrigate the trees and fencing.
  The school is not fully fenced and thus goats sometimes find their way into the school premise and browse on the trees.
The school has no sufficient water to cater for their staff and student needs. In such instances trees are not prioritised for irrigation.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Job creation, capacity building.

 EBZ has employed two full time employed who work at the newly constructed Nursery and at Buwerimwe Restoration site.

Some community members are empoloyed on part-time basis and they collect seeds.,supply top soil, prepare outplanting area and weeding.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: The trees from the nursery planted at Buwerimwe Secondary School are all alive and growing. Its too early to harvest any forests products from the restored site. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: Whilst it is too early to formulate any conclusion but based on the markers of change such as increase in interest to planting trees EBZ is convinced that the environmental improvements will be positive to the community. Buwerimwe Secondary School started with 100 trees which they planted in June 2017 and now up to date they have planted 2000 trees at the school premises. The trees came from the newly constructed Marange Nursery.  
Community members are frequenting the nursery more often to pick up trees and to date 30 people (20 males and 10 females) have picked up 150 trees. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: The inclusion of sisal plant and vetiva grass is helping in slowing down the expansion of gullies. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: no Key lessons
• The need to have several perennial water sources before restoration activities start.
• Have an irrigation system in place for at least the first 5 years of the restoration project to ensure tree are sufficiently watered to reduce wilting and eventually mortality.
• The need to have solid tree protection strategies in place.
• Continue with community engagements to ensure there is collaborative efforts in protecting the trees.
• If research shows that water absorbing gels will not have effects on the environment, they can be used to easy water shortages.
Adaptive management actions.
• Due to high temperatures off rain season, between March and November, most trees will be showing signs of stress. We engaged students who are now bringing 2 litres of water each from their respective homes to water the trees.
• Employed a simpler irrigation system for each tree that uses a 2liter bottle being inserted into each tree planting hole and water is released slowly for several days.
• Mulching also is being used to retain moisture. Nursery

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/reversing-land-degradation-in-africa-by-scaling-up-evergreen-agriculture/	Reversing land degradation in Africa by scaling up Evergreen Agriculture	Ethiopia	2017-09	2022-09	"Regreening Africa is an ambitious five-year project that seeks to reverse land degradation among 500,000 households, and across one million hectares in eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa. By incorporating trees into croplands, communal lands and pastoral areas, regreening efforts make it possible to reclaim Africa’s degraded landscapes.The overall objective of the project is to improve livelihoods, food security and resilience to climate change by smallholder farmers in Africa, and to restore ecosystem services, particularly through evergreen agriculture.Agriculture & Livestock, Climate Change, Deforestation, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Mining & Resource Extraction, Other An estimated 83% of sub-Saharan Africans are dependent on land for their livelihoods, yet two thirds of African land is already degraded to some degree. In many African countries land degradation is higher than 65%. This is attributed to high poverty level, cultivating of sloppy areas, overgrazing, deforestation, over-exploitation of wood resources outside protected areas, illegal mining and bush fires. This has resulted in soil erosion, low land productivity, loss of biodiversity and habitat, green house gas emissions and climate change impacts, reduced household income and food security, disrupted soil cycle and ecosystem services. This further exacerbates a vicious circle that worsens poverty, hunger, unemployment, instability, and the migration and conflict these afflictions breed. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Attributes: low tree cover; low rainfall; food insecurity; land productivity; low income/ poverty; land denudation (bare lands with gulleys, rills,); climate change impacts; low biodiversity.
Benchmarks: tree cover; tree diversity at household level; diversified income; gender involvement at household level; management of tree species; value chain development; food security; wealth status; number of households adopting.
Structure: nutrient flow within the system (soil fertility, nutrient recycling, nitrogen fixation, carbon storage (above-ground and below- ground; plants and animals; improved soil properties in terms of nutrients, fertility, living micro-organisms; increased rainfall; water retention capacity of the soil; organic matter; different living organisms e.g. animals, pollinators, decomposers, birds e.t.c; number of tree species regenerated.
Rationale:
a) Outstanding technical, implementing and sub-granting experience in scaling-up evergreen agriculture practices in the relevant country;
b) Strong grassroots presence in the relevant country;
c) Strong administrative, management and implementing capacity;
d) An exceptional track record of prior success in scaling-up evergreen agricultural practices in the country;
e) Strong commitment, responsiveness and proactive participation of the partner organizations in providing the information needed to make good decisions on the country lead organizations;
f) Where possible, keeping in mind a fair and equitable representation of the proponent partner organizations as leads across the eight countries. This consideration will be deployed for those countries where the above criteria are met to a comparable extent among more than one lead organization proponents in a country. 
Document land degradation indicators in target areas using various forms of data to monitor the achievement of the scaling-up targets in each of the countries and aid in policy decision making
Identify, analyse and document existing large-scale re-greening successes at the grassroots in each of the countries and suitable participatory approaches for accelerated scaling-up
Influence country policy and regulatory frameworks to ensure they are conducive to the scaling-up of evergreen agriculture
Broadly communicate regreening successes to policymakers, relevant public administrations and development communities in each country to inspire accelerated scaling-up targeting 500,000 farmers
Develop and strengthen local tree-based value chains to support the scaling-up of evergreen agriculture production systems


Monitoring Details: Periodic review and refinement of country specific Theories of Change (ToCs) and accompanying logical frameworks - It is increasingly recognized that having an appropriately specified ToC—one which is subjected to periodic review and refinement is an important foundation any project Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) system.
 
Overall and country specific impact assessments - understand and credibly evidence outcomes and impacts, as well as the cost i.e. the project’s social and environmental returns on investment. Follow-up impact studies will be conducted to verify the project’s downstream impacts

Baseline and endline surveys will capture data on key socio-economic and biophysical variables, including data associated with the outcome and impact indicators of the project’s overall and country specific logical frameworks. 

Farmer-level uptake surveys and ‘progress marker’ tracking - this will be done during the project’s implementation phase to assess progress, rather than leaving this until the end when it will be too late to undertake corrective measures. Rapid evergreen agriculture uptake surveys will be undertaken on an annual basis by country teams once implementation is underway. 

Output and farmer reach tracking and technical field monitoring - overall and country specific systems will need to be developed and put in place to track the delivery of project outputs and other key deliverables. While field monitoring will be undertaken on an ongoing basis by field teams, more structured and systematic technical monitoring is to be undertaken by teams of relevant representatives of the participating institutions at country level on a bi-annual basis. The findings from such country-level joint quality monitoring missions will be used to inform country level planning and adaptive management processes.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: 1. Deforestation and habitat loss: 
-Alternative income sources through tree-based value chains such as bee keeping. Work with the community to identify and develop priority tree-based value chains
-On-farm tree planting e.g. fruit trees, fodder trees, dry-land timber species. Train and support tree nursery operators to raise quality tree germplasm and improved variety tree species such as Mango through grafting
-Encourage regeneration of indigenous tree species on agricultural landscapes, rangelands and forest areas (e.g. Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) and Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR)).
-Conduct participatory selection of community change agents; establishment of model sites and Rural Resource Centres for learning purposes.
-Alternative energy sources like improved cook stoves
-Promote the use of zai pits and half moons for enrichment planting especially is dry areas
-Promote the use of water conservation or micro-catchment structures e.g. farm ponds, zai pits
-Mainstreaming restoration initiatives into government policies and strategies
-Awareness creation on threats to the ecosystem and effective regreening practices 
-Local administration involvement for project sustainability 

2. Invasive species
-Encourage sustainable removal of invasive species and replacing them with high-value trees
-Promoting tree-based value chains to control the spread of invasive species such as Prosopis juliflora e.g. processing the pods for sweets, flour and animal feeds; charcoal production 

3. Climate change: 
-Controlling greenhouse gas emissions through tree planting
-Grass reseeding to improve soil structure 

4. Over-exploitation of natural resources 
-Sustainable harvesting e.g. through pollarding, coppicing, pruning, cutting 
-Mining How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: 1)   Construction of soil conservation structures like gabions on gulleys, terraces, grass strips on slopes
2)   Grass reseeding as soil cover measure
3)Enclosures by protecting a piece of land for a specific period of time for it to restore to its original state
4)Surveillance & analytic tools that provide data to support decision making & monitoring for scaling-up️ How this project achieved a desirable species composition: 1)Awareness and training on the importance of having more tree species on agricultural landscapes and rangelands
2)Increase diversity of trees in the nursery How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): N/A How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): 1) Encourage natural renegeration of indigenous tree species
2) Enrichment planting to improve diversity of trees on landscapes How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): N/A Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: 1)Tree-based value chain development
2)Stakeholder engagement and mapping to identify policy gaps and opportunities that can be addressed by the project in relation to agroforestry and regreening. This is done through policy synthesis and analysis and stakeholder workshops; 
3)    Engage with national and sub-national stakeholders in each country to facilitate lesson sharing, identify opportunities for collaboration and collective develop a roadmap to regreening; 
4)    Support engagement with scaling stakeholders and policy processes to engage around identified opportunities and build partnerships, using evidence as a basis for constructive discussion; 
5)Strategic communication for behavior change;
6)Farmer field days. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The project has so far achieved the following:
1)We have supplied tree species
2)Carried out soil sampling
3)Baseline surveys
4)Value chain identification and prioritization
5)Land degradation dynamics at baseline level
6)Detailed implementation plans 

Uptake surveys which will inform us better on the extent of recovery are currently underway. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: Uptake surveys are currently underway Achieve a desirable species composition: Uptake surveys are currently underway Reinstate structural diversity: Uptake surveys are currently underway Recover ecosystem functionality: Uptake surveys are currently underway Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: Uptake surveys are currently underway Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Uptake surveys are currently underway

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Economic vitality and local livelihoods
1)Priority and economically-viable tree-based value chains have been identified and prioritized for development 
2)Some farmers have been linked to market actors e.g. farmers growing Shea trees and paw paw as a value chain
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: 1) Introduced them to high value tree species that have multiple benefits in terms of providing food, medicine, nutrition, fodder, fertiliser, e.t.c. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: N/A Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: 1) Grass reseeding on denudated landscapes
2) Zai pits and half-moons for moisture conservation Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: 1) Farmers have seen the need to introduce trees on their landscapes but are limited by the small sizes of their farms and competing land uses 
2) Introduction of policies by national governments that limit the land-use and tree ownership rights Based on field visits, workshops and one on one interactions with farmers, the project has established that:

Farmers have been practicing regreening practices such as Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) for years hence its not a new concept;
Combination of indigenous and scientific knowledge is key;
Farmers are not interested in just planting trees but are keen to derive benefits from them i.e. linkage with economic benefit. Value chains are main drivers to adopting land restoration approaches;
It is key to include farmers from the onset;
Strategic communication is key to effect changes in behavior from farmer to government level;
Motivation plan should be devised at the onset by creating suitable incentives for restoration activities;
The use of community videos is an effective tool for documenting what the farmers are doing and change in real time;
Farmers get fully immersed in what they are doing – farmers listen to their peers and are in a better position to learn from each other;
FMNR is not enough in some areas thus we have to introduce enrichment planting (options by context);
We have discovered that concepts developed by countries in the inception phase need to be re-designed and activities have to be re-aligned;
The selection and planting of appropriate trees can complement naturally regenerating ones, for example to improve nutritional outcomes, enhance household incomes, or to provide a perennial fodder, fruit or timber source. Evidence suggests that the success of the establishment of such trees is improved in landscapes already populated by naturally regenerated vegetation;
Farmer-centered extension approaches in general and farmer-to-farmer learning and knowledge sharing approaches in particular are often the most effective tools to build local capacity and to unleash the social spread of these practices;
Farmers, herders and other land users need effective national policies and legislation regarding access to land, and they need clear land and/or tree tenure rules to enable them to engage in the long-term investments that land management with trees requires. Successful experiences are very instructive in identifying pathways to success in the countries where such policies continue to be lacking;
Continual monitoring of activities on the ground that include socioeconomic and biophysical indicators as well as farmers’ perceptions is essential to ensure continuous improvements throughout the project and to reinforce the sustainability of the interventions.
 
Involvement of local government institution so that they can continue the activities and the best way to do it is;
Influencing policy at the local level;
Community by-laws on ecosystem restoration initiatives;
Creating a sense of ownership once the project ends;
Motivation plan with clear incentives and rewarding systems;
Developing tree-based value chains.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-minnesota-oak-savanna-restoration-along-an-urban-river/	USA: Minnesota: Oak Savanna Restoration along an Urban River	United States of America	2013	2019	"The Mississippi River Gorge, in the heart of the Twin Cities in Minnesota, is one of the most significant features of the entire 2,350-mile long Mississippi River. Oak savanna was once a common ecosystem in Minnesota, covering about 10% of the state, but it is now rare habitat because of fire suppression activities, farming, and development. Oak savannas are highly diverse because they are transition zones from woodland to prairie. An oak savanna restoration project has been implemented and continues to be maintained by local volunteers along a 5-acre stretch of the Mississippi River Gorge in the Minneapolis neighborhood called Longfellow. The project seeks to eliminate the threat of exotic species, reintroduce the appropriate gorge plant community, and address erosion concerns with the collaborative effort of national and local agencies, and the advocacy of the local community. Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Fire suppression has prevented the periodic clearing of understory vegetation typical of oak savannas. As a result, buckthorn and other invasive, exotic plants have become established in a thicket and crowded out native prairie species. Heavy recreational use along the Mississippi Gorge area has caused erosion issues. In some places, erosion was so severe that gullies had formed and sediment washed into the river during heavy rains.  The reference ecosystem is primarily based on historical information about ecological attributes at the site prior to degradation.The prairies of North America were once vast grasslands that covered 200 million acres, a complex ecosystem supporting a large amount of wildlife. Today, less than one percent of that native habitat is left. Prairies are composed of many species of grasses and forbs (wildflowers). Animals such as gophers, hawks, and bison, in addition to many native insects rely on prairie ecosystems.  Oak savannas are a community of scattered oak trees (Quercus spp.) above a layer of prairie grasses and forbs that once covered 10% of Minnesota. The trees are spaced enough so that there is little to no closed canopy and the grasses and forbs receive plentiful amounts of sunlight. The savanna is often thought of as a transition system between the tallgrass prairie and woodland environments, but may contain species that are found only in it and not in either forest or prairie. As a result, it is an important and diverse system containing species from both woodland and prairie, but containing some species that is unique to only savanna. Savannas rely on periodic disturbances such as fire, grazing, and drought to flourish. Such disturbances prevent most tree species from establishing themselves and turning the habitat into a forest community. Fire-adapted trees, such as bur oak trees with their thick, corky bark, and prairie grasses are resilient to fire and do well in environments where fire is a common occurence. Oak savannas are highly diverse ecosystems, so measuring diversity following restoration is a measure of health and stability of the ecosystem.  
  
Eradicate exotic species in the area.
Reintroduce and restore native oak savanna species and the appropriate community distribution.
Engage the local community in interpretive events and volunteer activities.


The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The land is owned by the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, but this area of the gorge in the Longfellow neighborhood is part of the 72-mile stretch of the river that is designated national park. Following community advocacy for restoring the area and addressing erosion issues, project partners – the Longfellow Community Council, Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, and National Park Service – developed a plan to guide restoration efforts. Volunteers from the local community organized by Friends of the Mississippi River and Ecological Strategies embraced these restoration efforts in the past six years by participating in invasive species removal, litter clean up, seed collection, planting, and through strengthening their ties to the gorge at interpretive events. Thanks to the collaboration of many partner organizations and countless hours of volunteer service for more than ten years, the area that was once a buckthorn thicket is now showing signs of renewed life.
 

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: To address the erosion issues, the eroded gullies were filled with soil and seeded with native grasses and flowers. Signs were also posted asking hikers and other recreationists to remain on the designated trails. In some places, temporary fences were installed as an added protection measure. At steeper portions of the trails, erosion control bars and stairs are being installed. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: Measures have also been taken to reestablish vegetation on paths where it had been worn away and soil exposed from people traveling up and down the bluff, off designated trails, to access the river. Buckthorn and other non-native woody plants, as well as some native trees, were removed to restore the openness of mesic oak savanna forest. The stumps of the exotic species were treated with an herbicide to prevent regrowth. A prescribed burn plan was developed as part of the maintenance plan. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Native prairie plants were planted. Volunteer groups continue to remove exotic species like sweet clover, reed canary grass, and garlic mustard and maintain existing plantings and the collection and spreading of desirable native seed at this site designated as oak brushland that is being restored to oak savanna. 
Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: The project has restored the open landscape typical of oak savanna and doubled the amount of mesic oak savanna in the metropolitan area. Achieve a desirable species composition: Native plants appropriate to the oak savanna gorge community have returned to the area.

Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: Ecological Strategies hosts Oak Savanna Workdays in the Longfellow restoration project area which offer an opportunity for local residents to learn more about this site, create a special place for residents of gorge neighborhoods and thousands of annual visitors, and instill a sense of connection to the river gorge area in visitors through interpretive activities. Following the clearing, resource specialists will carry out prescribed burns each spring for three years to maintain the forest opening and allow prairie plants and shrubs to become reestablished.
Volunteers will continue to help remove buckthorn, revegetate eroding areas, and collect seeds from mature prairie plants for use in future restoration projects. Going forward, volunteers will continue ongoing efforts to keep the area free of buckthorn and other invasive plants are critical to the project’s success. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-washington-elwha-dam-removal-and-river-restoration/	USA: Washington: Elwha Dam Removal and River Restoration	United States of America	1992	2014	"In the late 1800s, the Northwest region was used to supply the lumber needed to build new cities throughout the growing United States, bringing rapid change to the Olympic Peninsula. The Elwha River was severely altered as a result. In the early 1900s, two dams, Elwha and Glines Canyon, were built. The dams fueled regional growth, but blocked salmon migration upstream, disrupted the flow of sediment and wood downstream, and flooded the historic homelands and cultural sites of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. For over a century, the web of ecological and cultural connections in the Elwha Valley were broken. In 1992, Congress passed the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act, authorizing dam removal to restore the altered ecosystem. After two decades of planning, the largest dam removal in U.S. history began on September 17, 2011. Six months later Elwha Dam was gone, followed by Glines Canyon Dam in 2014. Today, the Elwha River again flows freely from the Olympic Mountains to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Although the two dams removals were originally branded as salmon-restoration projects, they have had significant watershed-wide and scientific impacts. Dams & Hydrology In the early 1900s, entrepreneur Thomas Aldwell saw the river and its narrow gorges as an economic opportunity. He sought to harness this raw, massive energy, and so he formed plans to build a hydroelectric dam. With financial backing from Chicago investors, the Olympic Power Company was formed, and the plans for the dam were materialized when construction began, in 1910. Functional in 1913, the Elwha Dam supplied energy to power the pulp mill in Port Angeles. A growing economy and a greater demand for industry led to the decision to build another dam. By 1927 Glines Canyon Dam was built eight miles upstream. Power generated by the dams helped fuel the local economy, but the failure to build fish ladders left the Elwha River with a mere five miles of available habitat for returning anadromous fish. The number of fish returning each year plummeted from 400,000 in the early 1900s to just 3,000 after the dams’ construction blocked much of the river and its tributaries.
The dams had a number of other serious impacts including sediment and silt blockage behind the dams, erosion of the river banks, and the effects on a huge portion of the park and people that previously relied on the anadromous populations for sustenance. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on historical information about ecological attributes at the site prior to degradation.For millennia, the Elwha River ran wild, connecting mountains and seas in a thriving ecosystem. The Elwha River basin covers over 300 square miles (833 square kilometers), transporting freshwater and sediment from the Olympic Mountains to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Some of the richest runs of salmon outside of Alaska, with crowded upstream to their spawning grounds in the wild Elwha River. The river ran freely through towering forests that sheltered a living community including black bears, cougars, eagles and the Klallam people. Ten different runs of anadromous fish, eleven varieties of salmon and trout, including coho, pink, chum, sockeye and Chinook salmon, along with cutthroat trout, native char and steelhead, made the pristine valley their home. For millennia these fish thrived in the river and provided food for the Lower Elwha Klallam tribe who lived along its banks. 
Restore the salmon and trout populations to the river.
Restore the river habitat connectivity from the headwaters down to the coast.
Minimize presence of invasive, exotic species.
Restore natural ecosystem processes.
Establish native forests.
Comprehensively monitor the changes to the river post-removal including: 

How the rebuilding of salmon populations would unfold
The response of resident fish populations and other aquatic life to returning salmon populations
How and when the sediment would redistribute through the system
How quickly the ecosystem would stabilize after full dam removal (especially the former reservoir areas)
How released sediment would affect freshwater and marine ecosystems and their biota
How other animals, such as ducks, river invertebrates, frogs, and black bears, would respond to dam removal and the return of salmon to the upper parts of the watershed
How plants would recolonize and whether invasive species would influence re-vegetation in exposed reservoir areas. 




Monitoring Details: The Elwha River Restoration project provides a rare opportunity for scientists to learn what happens when a dam is removed and salmon return to a wild, protected river. Monitoring is being conducted as part of ongoing research efforts. Scientific monitoring and analysis for the project is led by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in coordination with the Olympic National Park, Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, the Bureau of Reclamation, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other local and state entities. Efforts to track the effects of dam removal on the river include monitoring and analyses of river water and sediment discharge, channel morphology, floodplain vegetation, and river geochemistry and nutrients. Researchers continue to monitor the river and nearby wildlife and have already compiled a crucial library of information about the world’s largest dam removal and restoration project to date. What they’ve learned, and how they are measuring success, will be a guiding light for future dam-removal projects.
The dams’ removal was decades in the making and the result of advocacy led by the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe and conservation groups. Today, although dam removal is complete, the restoration of the Elwha River and its ecosystem is an ongoing process. The National Park Service is working closely with Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe and many other partners to achieve those goals.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: The dams themselves were the largest threat to the ecosystem, altering the natural hydrology and ecosystem of the river. The dams were removed to eliminate this threat. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: Prior to dam removal, most of the river's natural sediment flow was trapped in reservoirs behind the dams. As the dams came down, over 100 years of accumulated sediment, or 19 million cubic meters, was released downstream, making it the largest controlled release of sediment into a river and marine waters in history. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: The primary objective of the dam removals was to restore the salmon population by expanding their habitat and spawning ground area. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Park botanists and dedicated volunteers have begun the labor intensive task of reestablishing riparian areas by planting more than 400,000 native plants in the newly exposed sediment. Without the dams blocking sediment flow, the objective was to return sediment to enrich habitat along the river. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): More than 100 species of wildlife are known to eat salmon during one or more stages of the salmon’s life cycle. Additionally, nutrients delivered upriver by migrating salmon permeate wildlife food webs near salmon-bearing rivers. Restoring salmon populations and habitat by removing the dams is key to sustaining many species of wildlife in the riverine environment and restoring ecosystem functionality. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): The two dams were removed to restore the natural hydrology and connectivity of the river. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Once removed, the natural hydrology of the river has been renewed and the river ecosystem has begun to be restored. The full extent of river restoration has yet to be realized since the project completion is still recent, so the effects of dam removal continue to materialize. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: The release of 100 years worth of sediment behind the dams caused elevated water turbidity, changes to the channel shape, and modifications to river habitats, including the renewal of sandy beach habitat near the nearshore environment where the river ends.  It took only about two weeks for sediment released from the dams to reach the ocean.  Some sites received as much as one to three feet of sand as the river moved the accumulation from the reservoirs. Achieve a desirable species composition: It’s still too early to tell how large the rebound will be for salmon populations and other species populations, but initial results are encouraging. A multitude of species have returned to the park.  Adult fish from all the species have returned, including Chinook , coho. There are increases in sockeye salmon and bull trout.  Pink and chum populations are still lower than desired, but overall, there has been a positive response for the majority of the populations throughout the watershed. Elwha River salmonids have renewed access to more than 70 river miles of pristine spawning habitat protected within the park. Reinstate structural diversity: The nearshore environment, where the Elwha River meets the sea is changing in leaps and bounds. With renewed sediment flow, sandy beaches are reappearing and nearshore habitat that once provided rich shellfish beds is reemerging.  Dungeness crab, shrimp and forage fish liked by salmon, birds and other marine life quickly moved in to colonize the new sandy terrain. Recover ecosystem functionality: Elwha River salmonids have renewed access to more than 70 river miles of pristine and protected spawning habitat. Studies are ongoing to quantify how dam removals impacted salmon-wildlife interactions and river ecosystem functionality as a whole. One recent study found that access to salmon dramatically improves the lives of a riparian bird species called American dippers (Cinclus mexicanus). Even though these dipper populations hadn’t seen salmon for 100 years, they rapidly integrated the fish — and their nutrients — back into their diets. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: The river once again flows completely freely from the headwaters down to the strait, serving as reestablishing a key connectivity network for the surrounding landscape. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: There were a few kelp beds just off the river's mouth that were immediately covered with sediment, but overall there is much more good habitat now and the impacts have been all positive overall.

Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: The Elwha River is of great cultural and spiritual value to the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. It is thanks to their advocacy that the river restoration project occurred. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: Some of the renewed river area is not in the national park, and a local community is expressing interest in the new beach. New people are moving in, and they are building closer to the water's edge. That can lead to issues with toxic stormwater runoff and erosion. 
Rivers are highly efficient at transporting sediment. An estimated two-thirds of the sediment behind the dams has now moved downstream, with 90 percent of it reaching coastal habitats.
Removing dams has allowed the river to recreate its natural sediment regime.
The dam removal and resulting sediment flow led to the re-creation of the estuary, which has moved the mouth of the river about half a mile further out and provided new habitat for salmon and other species.
These ecosystems can be very resilient to these large-scale perturbations
It is important for researchers to think about the whole variety of creatures that could be impacted and try to do as much research as possible before dam removal.
For this project, a lot of baseline research was conducted on bears, the mid-sized carnivore communities, small mammals and amphibians, but the riverine bird community was somewhat overlooked. Dippers were studied, but the other fish-eating birds and the birds at the mouth of the river were not.

 Look at dam removal in its entirely, including what happens to the nearshore, and make sure that is a restoration priority. Dam removals should aim to optimize the nearshore environment by letting the sediment come to the shore.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/chile-restoring-and-rewilding-patagonia-grasslands-in-the-chacabuco-valley/	Chile: Restoring and Rewilding Patagonia Grasslands  in the Chacabuco Valley	Chile	2004	2020	"Patagonia’s 400 million acres of temperate grasslands support a unique biological and cultural heritage, and provide many important ecosystem services such as clean air and water, forage for livestock, carbon sequestration, and habitat for wildlife. In 2004, the NGO Conservación Patagónica bought a 222,000-acre property that was formerly an overgrazed ranch in the  Chacabuco Valley. Conservación Patagónica aimed restore the native grasslands and wildlife, and create a park to eventually donate to the Chilean government to create the Patagonia National Park. The main objective of the restoration project was to restore the Patagonia grassland ecosystem by rewilding and letting nature guide the restoration. The project has become one of the largest and most ambitious grassland restoration projects undertaken in the world. Agriculture & Livestock Most land in the area was privately owned and used for sheep ranching to produce wool and meat. Poorly managed ranching practices drove desertification in the area, leading to significant loss of native grasslands. Native animal species which rely on these grasslands, such as the guanaco population, were struggling to compete for food and space with an estimated 25,000 sheep and fencing blocking their movements.  The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).The Patagonia Park grasslands lie in the Chacabuco Valley. The Chacabuco Valley is one of the few east-west valleys in the region, creating an ecologically rich transition zone between ecosystems.  Grasslands ecosystems have less wildlife diversity compared to, say, tropical rainforests, they typically have more abundant wildlife. Species such as guanacos—the region’s iconic large mammal— as well culpeo foxes, armadillos, Andean condors, pumas, and rhea’s once dominated the landscape. Fires do not occur naturally in the Patagonia landscape and can be extremely harmful. 
  
Provide positive outcomes for people, wildlife and grasslands including protection and restoration of grasslands and their unique and fragile environments, and sustain the economic vitality of surrounding ranches which adopt sustainable practices. 
Maintain viable populations of key native wildlife species including puma, red fox, rhea, and guanaco. 
Reintroduce wildlife to the landscape through a rewilding program, especially focused on reintroducing top predators. 
Restore grassland ecosystem functionality. 


The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Conservacion Patagonica organizes volunteer programs to assist in the restoration process by removing invasive plants and spreading native seeds throughout the valley. Collaboration among Conservacion Patagonica, the Conservation Land Trust, Fundación Pumalin, Fundación Yendegaia and the Foundation for Deep Ecology has promoted the adoption of advanced sustainable agriculture, the development of local communities and a culture of activism that inspires local people and tourists to respect and defend wildlife. Working with local communities, the park has implemented an outdoor education program that brings young people to the park for natural science and physical education activities.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: The park land is now protected from ranching practices, and local ranchers and communities have been engaged in finding sustainable ranching and agricultural practices. Park volunteer groups have been removing and controlling nonnative plants that were introduced through livestock grazing and human development such as musk thistle, poison hemlock, spear thistle, and common mullein. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: The sheep were sold and over 400 miles of fencing was removed from the areas of land bought by the NGO Conservación Patagónica. Researchers have gathered soil samples to develop management plans for different areas and established research plots to test the effectiveness of reseeding and erosion control practices. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Native species were bred and reintroduced as part of a comprehensive rewilding program.Through a captive breeding project, park biologists are helping grow the population of Darwin’s rheas, the native ostriches. Native plants are being strategically reseeded. Volunteer conservationists collect seeds from native grasses, especially the coiron species, for use in reseeding heavily damaged areas. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Native plant species have been slowly recovering from the effects of desertification and invasive species. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: The Chacabuco Valley has made impressive and visible strides towards erosion control and recovery, but complete restoration will take decades. Achieve a desirable species composition: Native guanaco herds have flourished from an unsustainable population of several hundred to an estimated 3,000. Other native animal species have been returning to the landscape, but quantification is still undergoing as the project is not completed. Recover ecosystem functionality: The Chacabuco Valley’s grassland ecosystem is experiencing an amazing and faster than expected recovery.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Ranching is important for local livelihoods around Patagonia Park. Conservacion Patagonica, the Conservation Land Trust, Fundación Pumalin, Fundación Yendegaia and the Foundation for Deep Ecology have engaged the local community and specifically local ranchers to develop and adopt sustainable agricultural practices, and good practices in grassland management and stewardship.

Removing the livestock was a crucial step toward preventing the collapse of the Patagonian ecosystem.
Rewilding is essential to avoid extinction, and is important to not only  preserve the landscape and wildlife, but also to clean water, forests, and create functional ecosystems. Top predators in the grassland ecosystem are critical because if  the population of guanacos explodes this affects the grass and the whole ecosystem. 
 Conservacion Patagonica will continue to oversee implementation and post-implementation management. The goal is for the Patagonia Park land to be donated to the Chilean government within the decade to create the Patagonia National Park, at which time the government will oversee the maintenance of the restored ecosystem.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/china-tianjin-bridge-park-bringing-adaptive-regeneration-to-urban-wetland-restoration-design/	China: Tianjin Bridge Park – Bringing Adaptive Regeneration to Urban Wetland Restoration Design	China	2005	2008	"In 2005, in response to calls from residents to improve a 22-hectare deserted shooting range used as a garbage dump, the municipal government of Tianjin, China decided to create a park. The government contracted landscape architecture firm Turenscape to create The Bridge Park in downtown Tianjin. Rather than just create a traditional park, the design aimed to use adaptive regeneration to restore a self-producing ecosystem to the landscape and in addition to a beautiful urban park. Simple filling-cutting technology was used to create micro-topography to form landscape “sponges,” letting nature do the work of collecting acidic rainwater, neutralizing alkaline soils, repairing urban brownfields, and ultimately reintroducing the processes and structure of the native wetland predominant in the area. The guiding principle was to combine the processes of ecological restoration and ecosystem services. The natural process of plant adaptation and community evolution transformed the greyfield into a low-maintenance urban park; providing diverse nature’s services for the city including containing and purifying stormwater; improving the saline–alkali soil, providing opportunities for environmental education and creating a cherished aesthetic experience.Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The site was first used as a shooting range. The site was low and there were some fish ponds. Rapid urbanization changed the peripheral shooting range into a garbage dump and drainage sink for urban stormwater. The site became heavily polluted, littered, deserted, and surrounded with temporary rickety structures. The site was covered with garbage, the sewage was flowing, and the salinization was very serious. The soil was contaminated and highly saline and alkaline. The site area is densely populated at the south and east boundaries, the site is bounded on the west and north sides by a highway and an overpass. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Tianjin is bordered by Yanshan in the north of the Bohai Sea. Plains, tidal flats, wetlands, low altitudes and saline-alkali land are the most widely distributed and common natural landscapes here along the northeastern coastal region of China. The groundwater level in the area is high and the water system is developed. This geographical environment brings inspiration and inspiration to the park design. Thus, the reference ecosystem has flat, wild grass landscapes full of wetlands and salt marshes with highly diverse water and alkaline-sensitive native vegetation. Minor elevation changes will bring about changes in the physical and chemical properties of the ground soil, including water and salinity, which will ultimately be reflected in the plant community. 
The benchmarks used to evaluate restoration success is measuring soil contamination concentrations before and after implementation, specifically reduction in soil salinity and alkalinity. The successful return and survival of native vegetation and fauna such as weasels to the site will also indicate restoration success.  
Improve soil quality by remediating the contamination of the site caused by the garbage dump and urban runoff solve the problem of soil salinization. 
Retain stormwater in the depressions. 
Eliminate the threat of habitat destruction in the area and restore the native wetland habitat of the area to protect native biodiversity. 
Provide diversified ecosystem services for the city, including rainwater harvesting, noise reduction, pollution treatment,  and providing good recreation space.
Utilize the natural process to let nature do work and repair the ecosystem.
Form an efficient and low maintenance ecological park. 
Create an educational space where residents can learn about the native landscape through outdoor teaching. 
Create a low-maintenance park by creating an adaptive landscape which utilizes the natural plant community to stay wild and “messy” while cleaning soil and water. 
Allow nature to co-design the landscape 
Create a landscape that acts as a carbon sink 
Pollution treatment 
Waste recycling


Monitoring Details: The environmental restoration performance of Tianjin Bridge Park was measured by calculating the stormwater captured by the park in wetland depressions. The calculation was done by adopting the rainfall data of Tianjin Station (data from China Meteorological Science Data Sharing Network, China Ground Climate Standard Value Annual Value Data Set (1971-2000)), according to different material runoff coefficients, combined with topography and zoning map before and after construction. The resulting formula can be used to obtain the amount of rainwater collected by the Bridge Park. A SWMM simulation was used to generalize the watershed before and after the construction of the park, and a model was built to understand the impact of the wetland park. 
Soil alkalinity and pH levels were also monitored before and after project implementation.
The surrounding community has a population of nearly 300,000. Red-colored asphalt paths that weave through the palettes with interpretive signs and wood platforms that extend above the ponds and cavities were installed to allow visitors to engage with the restored native wetland.The nearby residents to the park were asked to answer questionnaire surveys about how the park implementation and educational opportunities altered their conception of ecological restoration. Tourists visiting the park were also surveyed about their experiences. Educational signage with scientific explanations for each type of natural system in the park including information about water, vegetation, and species, were installed to help visitors gain knowledge about the local natural system while experiencing the beauty of the native landscape. Commentary cards were also made available to understand the effectiveness. 

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: A large threat to the site area previously was habitat destruction.  The practitioners used the framework of “emergency service bionic restoration technology” to restore habitat to the project area. The design strategy mainly includes two aspects: one is to set up a set of artificial wetland system through terrain design to collect and filter rainwater; and the other is to use the collected rainwater to form water quality and water quality with different pH. Native plants and constructed wetland landscapes to achieve ecological restoration on saline-alkali land. The first strategy is the urban rainwater management green sponge technology described in 6.3 of this chapter, but it is also an important basis for realizing the biomimetic restoration technology of ecosystem services. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: The original site of Qiaoyuan Park was severely salinized. Native vegetation and topography that encourages soil infiltration was used to lower the  pH of the soil and water, improving overall conditions. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Through the ecosystem service bionic repair technology module, 48 species of arbor, 91 species of herbs, and 6 species of animals were selected and added to the wetland park. These species were selected as an “adaptation palette” such that they would create a “messy” natural aesthetic to the park, acting as a foundation for adaptative regeneration, to mimic the natural seasonal changes that would occur in the historic native wetland. Seeds of mixed ground cover and wetland species were sowed initially, and other native species were allowed to grow wherever they took root. Selected species included: Rosmarinus officinalis, Melampodium Lemon Delight, Caragana sinica, Ageratum conyzoides, Erigeron annuus, Catsia tora Linn Ligularia sibirica (L.) Cass., Herba Polygoni Perfoliati, etc. The clustered forest population is arranged between the blisters, and the most abundant willow tree in the area is used as a key tree species for the landscape. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): The project reconstructed the site area terrain using different depths of pits and ponds with the objective of collecting and purifying rainwater, while simultaneously promoting the natural succession of plants to create a variety of habitats. 
The core of Habitat's habitat design lies in the design of micro-topography and the design of water network. Through the terrain design, 21 pits and depressions with a radius of 10-30m and an altitude of 1-5m are formed. These pits and ponds are used to collect all the rainwater on the site. Each depression has different elevations. The altitude difference is 10cm. It is deep and shallow. Some deep waters are 1.5m deep and are directly connected to groundwater. There are shallow blisters; seasonal blisters are only in the rainy season. There is stagnant water; some are above the hills, forming a dry land. Different depressions have different water and saline conditions, forming habitats suitable for the growth of different plant communities. In the process of creating the terrain, the domestic garbage of the site is used locally for terrain reconstruction. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Seasonal changes in plant species occur and integrate the create a beautiful and ""messy"" native landscape. The park also successfully balances the constraints of the urban landscape and thousands of visitors to the park a year with preserving the integrity of the delicate native vegetation and wetland habitat quality by using elevated platforms extended over the habitat. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: Improved soil alkalinity in the dry ponds and water quality in the wet ponds as evidenced by field measurements. Three samples of water and soil were taken from the site in November 2011, August 2012 and December 2012, respectively, and the pH value was tested. The results showed that the pH of the water was reduced from 7.7 to 6.8 in 2012. Soil pH decreased from 7.7 and now fluctuates around 7.2.  Water pH levels dropped from 7.4. to 7 or less. Overall, soil and water quality improved. Achieve a desirable species composition: The restoration increased the habitat value of the site. After implementation, the water-sensitive adaptive communities that were introduced to the new wetland landscape were able to survive and fluctuate across the four seasons. The number of herbaceous plant species increased from 5 on the existing site to 58 following park construction, to 96 two years after the park opened. Ducks, geese, foxes, hedgehogs, rats, and weasels have been observed on the site. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: 2,950 shady trees and 8997 m2 reeds absorb about 539 tons of carbon per year, worth about 4.55 million yuan or $7,200.
The annual collection of rainwater from surrounding roads and roofs totaled about 1.16×108L, and the total amount of groundwater replenished was about 1.0×107L; the accumulation of accumulated rain and flood reached 7.8×107L; the reduction of rainwater runoff was nearly 100%, nearly 3.2×107L. The results showed that after the completion of the construction, the evaporation was reduced by more than half; the surface runoff was reduced by more than half; the amount of rainwater infiltration increased, which was more conducive to replenish the groundwater

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Today, the Bridge Park has become an important tourist destination in Tianjin. Every year 350,000 people visit the park, of which over 50% are senior citizens and 40% are children. The park improves access to green space for the 20,000 nearby residents who can now walk to a park in less than 15 minutes. The park is also served by 26 bus routes.
The low-resource demands of natie vegetation compared with the traditional park green space which requires heavy irrigation, this park can save nearly 959,000 yuan per year. According to the original site relics, the site pavement 84.5m3 was transferred to the original sleepers, saving about 160,000 yuan in paving costs. The park ecological wetland bubble based on the ecosystem service bionic repair technology module does not require weeding, trimming, irrigation and fertilization for maintenance and management, and can save 118,000 yuan per year in maintenance costs. The use of native vegetation for planting and planting is not only conducive to the repair of water problems such as rain and water, water quality, but also saves 31,000 yuan per year. The commercial building on the south side of the park can be rented for 700,000 yuan per year. Additionally, the project saved approximately $25,500 in lumber costs by reusing 84.5 cubic meters of old railroad ties in the construction of the observation platforms and bridges.
Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: In addition to the ecosystem restoration objectives, the Bridge Park is aesthetically sensible and designed to incorporate educational components. About 600 children and 500 students from nearby schools and educational organizations can participate in the park's environmental education experience mission. 
According to a questionnaire survey, the surrounding 20,000 households generally improved their awareness of the improvement of the ecological environment, and about 83.2% of the tourists agreed with the ecological design of the park. 
The recreation experience of the surrounding residents has been improved. The residents surveyed spend at least 15 minutes a day on this urban green space for leisure walks. A trail system with elevated platforms over the wetlands and resting places were introduced into the park design. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: The park's noise reduction capability can reduce noise from 70dB to 50dB. The wetland park is designed to collect stormwater runoff and filter water, which will aid in flood control and water quality. 
This is a successful example of a design approach to reestablish natural functions and let the dynamic processes of adaptation and succession occur. The project was successful in creating diverse habitats that require minimal management in an urban area while still allowing for people to visit and engage with the landscape. 
Key steps in the design process included: careful planning and plant selection, experimentation with species, monitoring of progress during the construction phase as plants became established, and adjusting the design accordingly to achieve the best performance.
The interconnected pedestrian paths that surround each of the ponds are a defining feature of the site. However, this dispersed pedestrian network makes circulation, privacy, and group activities challenging compared to a site with more selectively-place trails.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-chicago-the-wild-mile-urban-river-restoration/	USA: Chicago: The Wild Mile Urban River Restoration	United States of America	2014	2020	"The Wild Mile is an on-going project to restore a mile-long stretch of the Chicago River on the urbanized North Branch Canal in Chicago, Illinois, USA. The Wild Mile will be a floating ecopark – an innovative solution to enhance ecology along concrete-channelized river in a heavily industrialized area. Unique from previous park installations focused on recreation, the main objective is to reintroduce riparian and emergent landscapes, encouraging wildlife to return to the city. The park will also function as a public park, open-air museum, community classroom and living laboratory. Architects, ecologists, and city planners came up with a modular plan to alter the current hard-edged banks of the river with floating native gardens and forests which promote pollinators and water quality, install nature-mimicking habitat structures for native wildlife that double as art installations, and develop water aeration mechanisms. They seek to lead the world in promoting innovation and experimentation to inspire holistic thinking around ecology and urbanism. The project is an interesting example of river restoration within the confines of an urban system. If successful, the lessons learned from installing the floating platforms can be expanded to other sections of the Chicago River and urban rivers worldwide.  Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological), Dams & Hydrology, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The river was channelized to control flood risk, resulting in the removal of the riparian and emergent landscapes along the Chicago River. The hard walls of the channel and concrete channel itself severely limit the opportunities for vegetation to grow and habitat. Currently, parts of the channel walls are eroding and unstabilized. 
As a channelized river, the river is constructed as a transport mechanism for urban runoff. As rainwater runs off urban surfaces, it picks up pollutants that end up contaminating the Chicago River. The river has also become contaminated by untreated water going straight into the river and heavy rains causing sewage to leak into the water. As such, the Chicago River became heavily polluted and toxic for native habitat and species because oxygen levels became so low fish cannot survive.
  The reference ecosystem is primarily based on historical information about ecological attributes at the site prior to degradation.The Chicago River system is 156-miles of tributaries coming in from the north and northwest side of the city, flowing through downtown Chicago, and exiting the city on the Southwest side. The North Branch channel is the only channel in the city which still flows as it originally did (all other channels were reversed to preserve water quality of Lake Michigan). The project aims to simulate the original riparian wetland habitat that existed along the river as recently as 1904. The river as it naturally occurred would have had a gradated zone of habitat the transitioned between land and water from the upland, to riparian, to emergent, and finally to the aquatic zone. This zone bridges the transition from land to water, stabilizing the the river’s edge, providing quality and diverse habitat, and acting as a buffer for stormwater runoff. The upland habitat is characterized by well-drained soils, and plants that are more tolerant of dry conditions. The riparian habitat is characterized as the seasonal interface between land and water with plants that can tolerate both dry and wet conditions. The emergent landscape grows near shore in shallow water, rooted in river bottom sediment. Aquatic habitat constitutes plants that require an environment permanently saturated with water. 
The river would have had sediment and nutrients dissolved in the water to support invertebrates, frogs, fish, and aquatic birds. Nearby land would have constituted of invertebrates, lizards, birds, and small mammals. The Great Blue Heron is a notable native species. Restoration success with be evaluated based on whether multiple trophic levels of species are brought back to the project area through constructing habitat to encourage their return from the bottom up. The restored system will filter/cleanse the river water using native plant roots much in the same way the reference ecosystem would have. 
  The goal of the Wild Mile Chicago Framework Plan is to create a new environment for (1) habitat, (2) recreation, (3) remediate pollution in the river, and (4) education.
The goal of Wild Mile Chicago is to transform a section of the man-made, steel-walled Chicago River into an eco-park that serves people, wildlife, and the environment. Upon completion in 2020, Wild Mile Chicago will contain floating gardens, forests, wetlands, public walkways, educational learning stations, kayak access points, and more!
The specific objectives were to integrate a variety of open spaces, promote partnerships, coordinate education, cultural and recreational programming, create a sense of place by responding to unique conditions, provide connections using floating boardwalks, enhance and restore riparian and emergent landscapes, improve water quality. Primary principles and goals were to put wildlife first, connect people with nature, expand public access, design a cohesive experience, lead the world, and create a place for everyone. 
Three stakeholder meetings were conducted over the course of the process of evaluating existing conditions, developing a conceptual framework, and listing final recommendations. Stakeholder engagement included continuous meetings organized with adjacent property owners. Community members have been engaged through community feedback both through in person meetings and online form feedback. Three community meetings have been held thus far throughout the planning process to educate interested residents about the objectives and progress of the project. Community members indicated that they were most interested in nature and green spaces (65% of responses), and public paths and accessibility (38% of responses) promoted along the river. In addition to enhancing the ecological habitat, the project will create educational, recreational, and public art opportunities. The project leaders also organized community walking events along the Wild Mile and kayak trips. Local schools were engaged with classroom activities. 

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: - ""De-channelize"" the edges and increases the total surface area of the edges of the waterway by retrofitting them with green buffers (vegetated installations). 
- Install dog amenity areas away from habitat areas. 
- Introduce habitat with the ability to intercept urban stormwater runoff. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: - Alter the vertical walls of the channel to introduce varied hydrology so that the river begins to appear more like a natural winding river than a straight channel. 
- Vertical structures underwater will be installed to retain clean sediments in shallow flats.
- Terracing, geotextiles, brush layering, and willow fencing are being used to stabilize soil. 
- Along unstable shorelines, concrete mats will be placed to reduce erosion and provide foraging and shelter for invertebrates and small fish during high flow periods. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: In 2014, the volunteer-based non-profit Urban Rivers experimented with installing floating rafts with native plants growing into the river to see how the introduction of platforms mimicking natural habitat might increase fish populations compared to fish habitat along the straight walls of the river. This installation led to the Wild Mile project
There will be habitats designed for pollinators like bees and butterflies which in then will create the building blocks for more animals like insects, mussels, fish, turtles, bats, and birds. Research has been done to support methods for creating and sustaining habitat along the river.

Ideas for attracting this fauna include: 
- hexagonal apiaries
- floating wetlands
- native plant palettes were chosen based on native status and wildlife value (specific plant palette matrix is available in the additional resources).  
- submerged habitats that will artfully peek out of the water
- gourd birdhouses for Purple Martins 
- Large submerged concrete tubes for catfish habitat
- Shedd Aquarium will install and care for Shedd's River Island, 260 sq ft of dedicated floating habitat within the Wild Mile. Shedd's River Island features more than 15 strategically chosen aquatic, wetland and terrestrial plant species that provide food and shelter to native wildlife.
- WRD construction installed fish hotels- plastic boxes suspended in water with entry and exit holes.
- Turtles snags have been installed for basking. 
- Attempts to find solutions to promote pollinator, bat, and birds populations continue to be explored. 
- The University of Illinois is building a bottom-up, trophic-level bat habitat on the Wild Mile’s artificial floating riverbanks in the Chicago River to help sustain urban bat species affected by white nose syndrome and wind turbine fatalities.
- Biofilm and algae will be introduced so a man-made canal will transform into a lush home for plants and wildlife. 
- The goal is to eventually attract herons, hummingbirds, butterflies and other “awe-inspiring” animals. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): One of the most important things is introducing a natural edge back into the canal, ecologists have told the design team. Most healthy rivers have four levels—upland, riparian, emergent and littoral. So with the Wild Mile design, adding floating gardens, shallow pool areas, textured or terraced plant levels to incorporate a faux slope will create a cleaner river.
Retrofit the channelized edge of the river to re-establish natural form and process by creating habitat and intercepting runoff. The project aimed to assess the various edge conditions of the river such as hard walls, to bring in naturalized slopes and shallow edges. 
The project has been consulting with experts to understand how to add habitat to vertical walls and the eroded banks along the river. For vertical walls, options are floating platforms, terraced habitat fixed to the wall, or constructed shallow wetlands. For eroded slopes, solutions are rocky habitat installations, terraced habitat, or constructed shallow river habitat. 

The native habitat zones were recreated with artificial habitat types including: 1) submersed, 2) emergent, 3) trailing.climbing vines, 4) facultative wetland, 5) pollinator mix, 6) upland drought tolerant, and 7) floating trees. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Aeration waterfalls will be added into the river to raise oxygen concentration in the river so that fish can thrive. Plants designed to filter out pollutants and floating tree platforms will also restore ecosystem functionality. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): By installing floating platforms with native vegetation, encouraging pollinators, and introducing low trophic level organisms like algae and biofilms, the project aims to support the immigration of native wildlife species which would have existed along the river. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: (See socio-economic outcomes) 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: As the project is still on-going, the results of restoration actions are not yet thoroughly realized. Achieve a desirable species composition: The initial 2014 study found that the floating platforms of native plants had twice the number of fish compared to walls. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The channel will remain channelized in concrete which will limit the complete restoration and recovery of the ecosystem. Because the river is within a heavily urbanized area, the restoration of the system remains constrained because flood risk and water quality must remain strong considerations.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The team leaders identified and worked with the existing uses along the Wild Mile project area and brought adjacent property owners into the planning conversations. 

The park will have public walkways to bring life to the community and revitalize businesses along the river’s edge. The project seeks to create a sense of place along the Wild Mile for Chicago residents of all ages and backgrounds by improving and creating access and open spaces all along the project area.
Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: The project promotes partnerships with local institutions that coordinate educational, cultural, and recreational programming along the river. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: Water quality was a key concern for community stakeholders.  As the water passes through the roots of the eco-park, the roots absorb the water along with the substances in the water. This process of using plants to naturally clean the waste in the Chicago river is called phytoremediation. The initial 1,500 square feet of the park was installed in June 2017 by Urban Rivers. The successes and failures of this initial installation was used to guide the next installations. An educational platform and kayak launch will be completed in Spring 2019. The remainder of the project is set to be completed by next year (2020). Chicago’s Metropolitan Water Reclamation District (MWRD) has partnered with Urban Rivers to conduct a 4-year study measuring the effects of our floating habitat on the populations and health of local fish species. MWRD utilizes electrofishing techniques to safely and efficiently gather fish and benthic organism samples every few months.
The non-profit organization partners with universities and students on research projects to scale impact and insights about the Wild Mile. Research topics include Depaul University students are looking into business implications, Northeastern Illinois University is researching periphyton and performing mesocosm experiments at the Chicago Botanic Garden to better understand the effects of our floating habitat on the river ecosystem. The lab of Dr. Eric Peterson at the Illinois State University is assessing the impact of the floating wetland habitat on water quality metrics (e.g. the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, chloride) in the area immediately surrounding the installation. Conducting urban bird surveys. The University of Illinois is building a bottom-up, trophic-level bat habitat on the Wild Mile’s artificial floating riverbanks in the Chicago River to help sustain urban bat species affected by white nose syndrome and wind turbine fatalities.
The long-term goal for the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to deauthorize navigation along the North Branch Canal of the Chicago River. In the short-term, the USACE is exploring a programmatic approach to permit habitat restoration and floating walkways.  "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/mexico-participatory-approaches-to-ecological-restoration-in-hildago/	Mexico: Participatory approaches to ecological restoration in Hildago	Mexico	2008	2008	"In the State of Hidalgo (Mexico), a participatory approach to forest restoration was launched with the objective of recovering the productive capacity of forests, which is essential for biodiversity conservation and for the economic well-being of local communities. Hidalgo, with a population of 2,354,885 inhabitants, covers an area of 20,987 km2 in the center of the country. It has a wide variety of ecosystems in tropical, temperate and semi-arid climates. Poor management of natural resources has caused various degrees of disturbance in 292,000 ha of forested areas, resulting in 22,000 ha of fragmented rainforest and 31,000 ha of fragmented temperate and semi-arid forest. High rates of deforestation and forest degradation in Mexico’s rural communities have increased poverty and are causing rural populations to migrate to cities and foreign countries. The state of forest degradation, its causes and possible solutions were evaluated through regional and local community workshops. Criteria for selecting restoration techniques and plant species were based on the economic needs of the communities, known uses of the plants, seed availability, ecological function and site characteristics, among others. A total of 30 catalyst species and 23 rare species, all native, were selected for the four ecosystem types in the region. It was found that community members have a remarkable understanding of the state of local natural resources and that their participation was crucial to the success of restoration projects.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fire & Weather Events, Fragmentation, Mining & Resource Extraction The situation of forest degradation in the State of Hidalgo is common in much of Mexico. The annual rate of deforestation in Mexico from 2000 to 2005 was 0.4%, equivalent to 260 000 ha lost. Forest degradation is attributed to the expansion of agriculture and pasture lands and the increase in human population. For rural communities, which contain 80% of the forested land of Mexico, forest degradation has brought negative socioeconomic consequences, such as increasing poverty and resulting migration to cities and foreign countries. In Hildago, poor management of natural resources has caused various degrees of disturbance in 292,000 ha of forested areas, resulting in 22,000 ha of fragmented rainforest and 31,000 ha of fragmented temperate and semi-arid forest. This degradation altered the hydrological cycle, and induced a decline in biodiversity and productivity, and increased soil erosion. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on contemporary reference sites or existing analogues of the pre-degradation ecosystem.The State of Hidalgo lies 60 km north of Mexico City. This project was carried out in 2,896,08 km2 in the south-eastern part of the state, covering two geocultural regions: the Valley of Tulancingo (municipalities of Tulancingo, Santiago Tulantepec, Cuautepec, Atotonilco El Grande and Metepec) and the Sierra Otomí Tepehua (municipalities of Acaxochitlán, Tenango de Doria and Huehuetla).
These municipalities represent most of the forested ecosystems in Hidalgo state. Temperate, semi-dry oak forests predominate in a transect running southeast to northeast; subhumid and humid temperate pine oak forests are located more to the east; temperate humid montane forests flourish at higher elevations and small fragments of secondary vegetation derived from perennial rain forest are observed at lower altitudes.  The project was initiated in order to gain a better understanding of the root causes of forest ecosystem degradation in the region, directly from the people involved in the problem.

Identify the causes of destructive activities in the ecosystem, their repercussions for local communities and possible solutions.
Select woody species with the greatest potential for use in restoring these forest ecosystems, based on traditional knowledge and the experience of local technicians and project researchers.
Harmonize the rehabilitation of land productivity with environmental services, particularly the recovery of biodiversity.
Use the information generated by this research is to form the basis for implementing research and disseminating restoration projects in the State of Hidalgo.


The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The state of degradation, its causes and possible solutions in the communities were evaluated through participatory rural evaluation, interviews with key informants and focus groups, and periodic meetings with interested groups and training workshops.
Methods were focused on two levels of participation: a) regional – regional workshops and b) local – local community workshops.
The regional workshops were conducted in a town that was chosen to represent each of the regions studied, with the participation of municipal authorities and government institutions. The local workshops were held in communities or ejidos with the participation of local farmers and municipal authorities. Concepts relating to forest ecosystems and their degradation and restoration were presented in these workshops. An analysis of the causes, effects, and possible solutions to alleviate degradation of regional and local ecosystems was compiled after participants filled out a questionnaire. A workshop was held in each of the study regions, in which local authorities in rural development, forest ecology, and public protection participated. Communities with the most forest degradation were identified in these workshops, in order to select communities where the local workshops would be held.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: In order to better understand the main threat to the forest system, workshops were held to listen to the opinions of people from both communities and local authorities in Hidalgo. The project worked with the local community to assess the causes of existing degradation threats to the ecosystem, and then develop strategies to remedy these threats. The causes and solutions were evaluated using participatory rural evaluation, interviews with key informants and focal groups, periodic meetings with interested groups, and training workshops. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Some community members had already carried out reforestation projects, mainly under institutional programs where they did not take part in the planning and selection of species of interest. 

A multi-pronged strategy was implemented to accomplish restoration goals. A seed collection program was established for the nurseries in cooperation with producers and project collaborators, in order to obtain seeds from high-value trees, such as cedar (Cedrela odorata) and walnut (Juglans mollis). Project collaborators were trained in nursery techniques and care so that they in turn could educate members of their communities on how to operate the nursery. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): This project aimed to rehabilitate lands suffering from deforestation and abandoned after intensive agriculture and ranching by implementing land use systems that are suited to the region, and to include, whenever possible, economically valuable native woody species.  These appropriate land use systems were determined through the participatory methods with local communities. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: The project used community participatory methods to evaluate restoration potential in Hildago.  Tools used to encourage the participatory approaches included workshops with round-table discussions, rapid ecological assessments, and participatory community evaluations. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The municipal workshops determined that the principal causes of forest degradation are land use changes leading to soil degradation, overgrazing, forest fires, illegal logging and forest pests and diseases. This reflects the lack of zoning laws, forest stewardship and economic alternatives for the people of these areas.

Community members consider the principal causes of forest degradation to be illegal logging, forest fires, overgrazing and the presence of pests in the forests. They do not consider changes in land use as a factor in degradation. The perception of the population is that forest degradation began to increase during the 1980s with a decrease in the diversity and abundance of plants and animals, as well as in the number and volume of natural springs and water wells. Community members showed interest in participating in a planning exercise for the restoration of their degraded areas. The people represented their expectations for forest ecosystem restoration graphically. A planning proposal was drafted in these  workshops, consisting of three steps:

▪ enumerating the necessary actions
for restoration;
▪ organizing them in a logical fashion;
▪ justifying the proposed actions.

The result of this planning was the discovery that  it is necessary to consider the uses of native species in the different forest plantation systems. Achieve a desirable species composition: A preliminary selection of 30 catalyst species and 23 rare species was made for the four forest ecosystem types found in the study region. All of the selected species are native. Catalyst species pertain to early and intermediate succession stages, while rare species are from intermediate and advanced stages. 

Farmers associated with this restoration evaluation project are participating in agroforesty techniques, planting several of the species  recommended (above) for restoration in association with crops and fruit trees such as papaya. Recover ecosystem functionality: Information from community members with knowledge of the natural forest system and a literature review suggested potential systems to use for restoration: management of natural regeneration, forest plantations, enrichment plantings, stream restoration, and agroforestry systems. The most frequent attributes of the catalyst species were: erosion control, litter accumulation, rapid growth and habitat and food for wildlife. 
Where possible, natural regeneration of the forests was encouraged. Project collaborators helped land owners and communities to identify important areas of natural regeneration. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: Tree regeneration in the understory was more successful beneath plantations than in abandoned fields – plantations can actually facilitate and encourage faster succession. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: It is still too early to anticipate the success of these systems in achieving the objectives that were established by the researchers and the farmers. In addition, this is a dynamic process through which other species and restoration systems may later be identified. 

During the workshops and field walks, it was recognized that producers needed training. Therefore, two courses in community nursery  management were held and a small nursery with native species from oak forests was constructed.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: According to the evaluation of the two regional workshops with municipal authorities, the primary causes of forest degradation are land use changes leading to soil degradation, overgrazing, forest fires, illegal logging and forest pests and diseases. This reflects the lack of zoning laws, forest  stewardship and economic alternatives for the people of these areas. The participating authorities identified 29 communities with serious forest degradation problems, as well as the causes of their deterioration. 
Based on the results of the local community workshops, community members consider the principal causes of forest degradation to be illegal logging, forest fires, overgrazing and the presence of pests in the forests. They do not consider changes in land use as a factor in degradation. The  perception of the population is that forest degradation began to increase during the 1980s with a decrease in the diversity and abundance of plants and animals, as well as in the number and volume of natural springs and water wells.
Community members showed interest in participating in a planning exercise for the restoration of their degraded areas. The people represented their expectations for forest ecosystem restoration graphically. A planning proposal was drafted in these workshops consisting of three steps:
▪ enumerating the necessary actions
for restoration;
▪ organizing them in a logical fashion;
▪ justifying the proposed actions.
Several of the communities employed various methods to initiate forest restoration. Public and private lands were used in the efforts, although only local municipalities chose to set up plant nurseries. Measures to  prevent illegal logging and fire were taken by implementing various forms of observation and reporting systems. 
This project recognized that the success of forest restoration in Hildago depends on understanding the interests of the local community, there economic system, and the knowledge they hold. The ethnic composition of the municipalities is predominantly mixed Indigenous-European (mestiza), with a large segment of indigenous Otomí, Tepehua and Náhuatl groups in the municipalities of Huehuetla, Tenango de Doria and Acaxochitlán. The primary economic activities of these communities are agricultural (corn, beans, coffee and barley), cattle and goat ranching, and forestry, primarily with the following timber species: Pinus spp., Quercus spp., Liquidambar styraciflua and Cedrela odorata. There are two types of property ownership in the study region: ejidos (collectively owned and managed lands in Mexico) and private ownership. Ejidos cover 300-500 ha. The average parcel of land managed by each family in the ejidos is 2.04 ha. The political organization of the municipalities is represented by a mayor and municipal secretary. Agrarian governance systems consist of the ejido commission and rural producer organizations, which represent a form of authority in specific branches of agricultural production.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: The native woody species selected most often have multiple uses besides restoring the natural forest system: firewood, construction, medicine, honey and timber for the catalysts; timber, ornamental uses, medicine, firewood and construction for the rare species. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: During training exercises with the local community regarding restoration and nursery management, it was observed that learning the methodology has a role in developing people's self-esteem, because it gives value to their experience and knowledge. For this reason, the use and pursuit of this knowledge by researchers is of fundamental importance in identifying the course of action to be taken in the field. 
The most important decision in the planning of any plantation forest, whether the objectives are industrial, social or environmental, is the selection of the appropriate available species that will grow well in the site. 
The knowledge of rural populations is often an untapped mine of experience and wisdom on the management and use of natural resources. This knowledge should be incorporated into the technology used to resolve the current ecological crisis. 
 The use of participatory methods brought an understanding of the relationship between rural communities and the degradation of forested ecosystems. Local farmers and forestry and agricultural personnel possess a huge amount of knowledge about local woody species that should be utilized in future forest ecosystem restoration projects. Community members know and understand the state of their natural resource base and are therefore seeking enduring solutions for future generations. 
Future research and restoration activities are needed in the State of Hildago, but they must involve community participation. Furthermore, the long term success of restoration in Hildago depends on the integration and communication of restoration efforts and long term work plans between municipal authorities and local communities.
It is suggested that researchers take a more active role in community development while remaining sources of objective information. Once researchers establish a relationship with the communities, there may be opportunities for them to carry out long-term research projects in cooperation with those communities, which could be beneficial for both parties.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/madagascar-the-fandriana-marolambo-forest-landscape-restoration-flr-project/	Madagascar: The Fandriana Marolambo Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) Project	Madagascar	2004	2015	"In 2005, WWF began a Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) project Madagascar’s Fandriana-Marolambo region. Forest landscape restoration aims to restore forest functions in deforested and degraded landscapes through explicitly recognizing the human and ecological benefits of restoration. Fandriana-Marolambo is home to 150,000 people from three ethnic groups, situated in a moist tropical forest ecosystem consisting of fragmented forests interspersed with savannah, exotic plantations, and fields. 90% of Madagascar’s endemic species live in forests like Fandriana-Marolambo, including eight lemur species, but they are threatened by deforestation and degradation stemming from poverty.  Community engagement was critical to the success of this FLR program program. In 2013, 95,063 ha were used to create Marolambo National Park. Another 51,743 ha were managed by community-based organisations and an area of 6,786 ha was placed either under active or passive restoration. WWF began withdrawing in 2015. Local associations fully took over in January 2018. As one of the longest standing FLR projects ever undertaken, lessons learned from this 13 year initiative are valuable both in Madagascar, as the country seeks to attain its commitment to restore 4 million ha of forest, and in other countries. Lessons learned from this FLR initiative are valuable and should be shared widely.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fire & Weather Events, Mining & Resource Extraction Madagascar has been losing its forests consistently in the last 20 years. Between 1990 and 2010, about 57,000 ha of forest was lost each year, netting a total loss of over 1 million ha in this 20-year period. Before the project, deforestation rates were severe, reaching 2.58% in Fandriana, 1.38% in Mahanoro and 2.86% in Antanifotsy (regions of Madagascar) for the period 1990-2000 . As elsewhere in Madagascar, the main direct cause of deforestation is slash and burn agriculture with limited periods of fallow in between which reduces the soil’s ability to regain fertility, leading to the quest for more land, migration and more intensive burning. With a population growing at a rate of 3%, the need for further land to feed the population is inevitable. In the east of the landscape, forests are burnt for rice and sugarcane cultivation, and a small amount of coffee, banana and clove is also cultivated in the hills. In the west of the landscape, rice paddy cultivation is the mainstay, with some migration into the forest in between seasons to cultivate sugarcane. Faced with unclear and overlapping tenure, clearing forest is also a means of “acquiring” land. As a result, the forest in Fandriana-Marolambo is severely fragmented. Instability and poverty have been major underlying indirect causes of environmental degradation. Uncontrolled fires, collection of wood and non-timber forest products, and illegal commercial logging has led to an estimated forest loss of 40,000 ha/year between 1990 and 2005. Additionally, the illegal production of sugarcane for rum turned out to be one of the main factors causing degradation to part of the forest corridor.   The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).The reference ecosystem was selected based on existing natural remnants of the Fandriana-Marolambo tropical forest and previous knowledge of the ecosystem structure. The area is mountainous with an elevation range from 800 to 1800m. Fandriana Marolambo is an area of exceptional biodiversity and endemism covering about 200,000 ha of cultivated fields, fallows, grasslands, savannahs, exotic forests (pine and eucalyptus) and native forests. The high biodiversity of the area is due to fragments of both degraded and relatively pristine forests which form a 80,000 ha largely intact forest corridor with a width of 5 to 20km. Floristically, the forests present a high rate of endemism with for example the endemic Melanophyllaceae family as well as numerous epiphytes.  
Conserve the unique biodiversity and functional integrity of the forest
Restore forest goods and ecological service
Improve the well-being of the people living in the area
“The goods, services and authenticity of the moist forests of the landscape of Fandriana-Marolambo are restored so as to support the development of the populations and to secure the objectives of biodiversity conservation.”
Raise awareness among the local population and decision-makers about climate change, addressing deforestation and promoting FLR as a mitigation measure for climate change through its role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
Dispel myths about the facility of using tree planting as an easy option rather than reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Relieve pressure on the Marolambo National Park (established in 2013), but also on other natural forest in the landscape. 

The project team consulted extensively with local communities to elaborate a common vision of land use, identify their needs and wants, and develop opportunities for alternative livelihoods to alleviate poverty and reduce pressures on the area. Passive restoration sites were reinforced by traditional law or ‘Dina’ established by the communities, which helps make their engagement more official and protects sites against encroachment. 
One important goal was to build the capacity of grassroots communities to manage their own resources through Communautés de base (COBA). This voluntary process starts with the development of appropriate structures within the COBA, followed by socioeconomic studies and forest surveys of communities’ habits and needs, which allow for the identification of thresholds for sustainable use of natural resources. Management plans are developed which indicate strictly protected zones and areas where use of natural resources is allowed. Currently, eight COBAs—approximately 900 households or 5,000 people—have volunteered for these natural resource management transfers. 

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Key activities implemented were the engagement of the local populations and authorities, and ensuring that the project was inserted into the development plans of all 14 landscape communes. Contracts were signed with local communities to set aside areas for passive restoration in 50 sites. Active restoration was implemented together with communities in 73 sites covering a total of 500ha. 

The project used both passive and active restoration approaches, removal of invasive plants and creation of firebreaks to protect against brush fires. The project worked with local communities to develop strategies to reduce anthropocentric threats to the ecosystem. The strategies included agreeing on a joint vision for the landscape; clarify roaches to restore ecological integrity by promoting natural regeneration and acceleration of forest succession in some 5,000 ha through the removing land status and tenure; introducing the forest landscape restoration (FLR) concept and ensuring it was adopted within local development plans; building on local associations; supporting and initiating long term sustainability. Other activities attempted included adapting agriculture practices to be more sustainable, identifying alternative income-generating options for local farmers, restoration activities such as nursery development (particularly in partnership with local schools), and transferring management rights to COBAs. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: The project succeeded in restoring native tree species on degraded lands using old pre-existing exotic tree species which facilitated their growth. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Invasive plants were removed from 5,000 hectares and local communities were educated about the value of native local species for restoring degraded lands. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The first result of the project is the reduction of ongoing deforestation. In the western part of the landscape the deforestation rates were very high before the project (e.g. 2.20% per year in the commune of Fandriana, 3.56% in Antanifotsy during the period 1990- 2005). During the period 2006 to 2016, this rate has been maintained below 1% per year, partly as a result of the development of sustainable agriculture (rice) by local communities. 

In the eastern part of the landscape, the situation is more sensitive: the two main pressures, illegal rose wood extraction and sugar cane cultivation (for rum production) are still present (deforestation is about 1%), attributed to migrants and uncontrolled by local communities or the forest department. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: The restoration of indigenous forest improved soil fertility and quality of previously depleted soils. Achieve a desirable species composition: Local communities changed their negative perception of local species, which they used to think were difficult to produce and grow on degraded land and were slow growing. Now they see the value of local species and have acquired the knowledge to grow them.  As a result, there is a 75% survival rate for indigenous trees. Understanding the value of forests, notably to secure water, local communities are willing to set aside fields for restoration. Different methods have been tested, including transplanting wild saplings into nurseries, transplanting saplings directly onto the sites, germination in nurseries, direct seeding and pre-germination and cuttings. Based on this experience, transplanting saplings into nurseries first was found to be the best method to scale up production, with 80% of plants being produced in this way in the landscape. Old stands of exotic species present in the landscape (e.g. Eucalyptus stands of over 30 years) have also acted as nurse trees, improving local soil conditions and facilitating the growth of native species below. Reinstate structural diversity: The project actively restored 500 ha of forest, setting up 58 nurseries to produce and propagate 100 or so native plant species. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: In the eastern part of the landscape, two large deforestation culprits, illegal rose wood extraction and sugar cane cultivation, are still present because of a high movement of migrants and a lack of oversight by local communities or the forest department.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Research in the third phase of the project centered on improving the quality of life of local communities and identifying financing options (e.g. microcredit schemes) to help communities expand and improve their livelihoods, as well as help them to connect to markets.

Recognizing the importance of lifting the landscape inhabitants out of poverty so that they could be in a position to better protect and restore their unique natural environment, an emphasis was given to alternative livelihood approaches. The project sought to convince local communities to adopt alternatives to traditional shifting agriculture through demonstration rather than just teaching. Good progress in terms of improved agricultural techniques and both active and passive restoration were observed. 

Involvement of local communities in forest management was achieved through COBAs and management contracts.  To date 40 pilot projects have been established on sites held by community associations. Funding secured from the Swedish aid agency, SIDA, (EUR 298,424) contributed to empowering local communities by strengthening the institutional capacity of community-based organisations and supporting exchanges among these organizations.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: Community associations were trained in alternative agricultural activities that are more sustainable for the forest system including agroforestry, beekeeping, composting, cropping systems and others. Trainees were then encouraged to implement the new techniques in their villages, which in turn become the focus of dissemination tours where the benefits of the new activity are demonstrated. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: Radio shows and events were organised in the main towns together with the forestry administration and the local authorities. Fact sheets, posters and banners, as well as t-shirts and caps, and a documentary were produced. An annual walk was held across the forested corridor. Called the “Diabe”, this march was organised to raise awareness among villagers and the authorities about their important natural heritage. During the march, the emphasis was placed on halting deforestation, forest fires and illegal logging of precious trees. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: FLR helps to not only sequester carbon (mitigation) but it also helps both biodiversity and humans to adapt to changing conditions by, for example, protecting fields and human settlements from flash floods. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: One unexpected development was that project staff had to be significantly upscaled because of the communities’ lack of involvement in the development of the project and in their initial distrust of outside intervention. As such, the project was led by a coordinator based out of Fandriana but also counted on several local level facilitators to work with the communities, and two extension officers (“socio-organisateurs”) one for each of the western and eastern ends of the landscape. The Fandriana Marolambo project has made significant progress in a short time given the many challenges it has faced. Over the years, the project had to evolve, build on previous phases and adapt responsively to local needs. These have included difficulties in hiring staff and consultants with the required expertise to address illegal production of sugarcane for rum, one of the main factors causing degradation to part of the forest corridor and not identified early on as a problem. Managing expectations has been particularly difficult. WWF was the only outside organization working in some  communities, and there was pressure to accommodate community requests not directly related to project objectives such as reproductive health advice and transportation needs.

Given the extensive poverty within the project area, the restoration project required a comprehensive approach that has led to widespread support by communities and more lasting results. This integrated and innovative approach, however, made the project much more complex to implement and harder to sell to potential lenders and funders.
Forest restoration at a landscape level needs to be a long-term initiative. Five years is not sufficient, both from an ecological perspective and one of changing social and economic practices. Yet funders generally provide funding on a 1- to 5-year time horizon and long-term financing is a challenge.
The state is weak. Providing ongoing support for local coordinators as part of the project team has meant the project could progress even during political crisis at the national level.
Overall the high investment in local engagement has contributed to buy-in from the community. If the local communities are not convinced of its benefits, the restoration project will not succeed. Also working with pre-existing community associations meant there were already structures in place for training and supporting locals in adopting new approaches.
All the steps of the restoration project (e.g., defining the problem, engaging stakeholders, designing the project, developing goals and objectives, monitoring, etc.) are critical but not as linear as they seem. They often need to be undertaken in concert and revised as more is learned. Some activities such as beekeeping or demonstration visits were not anticipated at the beginning of the project, but were developed later in response to community interests.
Scale really matters: It is important to reconcile site-based interventions within the landscape with objectives at the scale of the landscape. Many interventions may need to be local but they should be integrated
within a landscape-scale plan.
Monitoring is critical: Monitoring needs to be integrated since the project initiation phase, and the necessary financial and technical means to ensure that it can continue in the long term must be secured.
Success requires a strong social dimension: Forest landscape restoration has both an ecological and
a social dimension, and the social one is fundamental to long term success. It includes the involvement of
key stakeholders, supportive governance and a well-defined exit strategy.
Start with capacity building: Capacity building to support FLR is necessary at different levels, from local
to national. It is necessary for sustainability and includes technical aspects as well as organisational ones.
 WWF began designing their exit strategy 2 years before completely pulling out in December 2017. The program relied heavily on external donor funding throughout its different phases which is not a financially viable model in the long term. The project acitivities helped to set up the program for long term success through engagement with local authorities and streamlining of project activities within local development plans, the creation and support of local associations such as the NGOs Loharano and Fanilo Spam and four unions/networks of COBAs (Mitafa, Soamirindra, Vahivahy and Tambazotra) which will continue beyond the project, strengthening civil society to operate more effectively into the future, and arming the local population and national forest service with skills to manage a diverse range of tree and plant species.
Donor dependence is a problem in Madagascar as in many other countries. WWF was active in the Fandriana-Marolambo landscape for a significant period of time. As it pulled out, it inevitably left a void. The WWF exit strategy consisted in two major strands: 1. Building local capacity of associations and community-based organisations, 2. Promoting income-generating
activities in the landscape such as essential oils. WWF took the time prior to leaving the landscape to identify and strengthen suitable local partners. At the national level, WWF has been seeking to further strengthen community-based organisations through the promotion of a national network of COBA federations.
However, the population is growing and pressures on land and natural resources continue. The hope is that having built and supported local associations and institution who have seen results of the FLR program in the field, they will now be motivated to pursue restoration independently and maintain and expand the actions initiated over 13 years of FLR intervention in Fandriana-Marolambo.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/mexico-applying-traditional-ecological-knowledge-to-forest-restoration-in-lacandon-forest/	México: Applying traditional ecological knowledge to forest restoration in Lacandon forest	Mexico	1993	2010	"The Lacadon forest is one of the most biologically diverse regions of Central America, located within the UNESCO Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve in Southern Chiapas, México, but it is under imminent threat from human disturbance. The Lacadon Maya people lived in harmony with the forest, farming and preserving it through traditional land use systems. Beginning in the 1970s, globalization and displacement increased the migration of people unfamiliar with traditional Lacadon agriculture into the forest, leading to a gradual loss of the Lacadon traditional agricultural practices, and an uptick in high intensity modern farming practices. Forest cover, soil fertility, species diversity have all decreased as a result, making room for the establishment of a highly invasive fern species. This project aimed to recover Lacadon Maya traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of the forest and scientifically validate traditional agriculture methods, and encourage the adoption of traditional methods to restore the Lacadon Forest and eradicate the invasive Bracken fern, Pteridium aquilinium.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) Globalization and displacement due to social and/or economic circumstances. has led to increased migration of people into the Lacadon forest area beginning in the 1970s. The influx of people unfamiliar with traditional Lacadon practices has intensified land use pressure and introduced large scale agriculture and cattle grazing to the area. The result has been forest degradation and a loss of traditional land use practices. Cattle grazing is one of the main causes of degradation in Latin America especially in the Mayan region according to the United Nations FAO ( Video Raices Mayas, 2010). Intensified land and loss of traditional practices has led to fragmentation, loss of ecosystem productivity due to soil compaction and loss of soil fertility, alterations to key ecological processes such as natural succession and regeneration, and reduced species diversity. 
The loss of forest cover and increased in cleared agricultural fields encouraged the spread of invasive Bracken fern, Pteridium aquilinium, which has halted natural forest succession. The fern thrives in open areas and shades out native plants with its dense vegetation and litter, prevents seedling establishment, and depletes the soil seed bank. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).The reference ecosystem for the Lacadon forest is defined by its relationship with the Lacadon people directing and influencing the composition and succession of the forest. The forest was huge with small patches reserved for agriculture, allowed to fallow for long periods of time. The tree composition favored colonizer species adapted to and favored by rapid natural succession and intensive use of small areas. The Lacadon describe two main types of natural vegetation: Monte alto forest and chaparral forest. Monte alto forest is dominant, growing in high perennial rainforest. Chaparral is characterized by smaller vegetation which grows in 5 hectare plots within Monte alto forest in areas prone to flooding near river and streams, and often in soil with high organic content. 
The reference ecosystem was selected based on interviews with remaining Lacadon Maya farmers who continue to practice traditional agriculture, and from an image of the forest composition and area created from cultural studies of the area during Mayan rule. However, much remains unknown about the state of the forest prior to Spanish colonization, and the economic needs of the recent migrants into the area and the pressures of globalization on local communities must be taken into account. 
The benchmarks used to evaluate restoration success are measures of improved species diversity in the area, recovery of native trees over degraded areas, and natural succession ability and rate. The restored system will have rapid natural succession of abandoned agricultural fields by native colonizers, high biodiversity, fertile aerated soil, and buffer zones of forest surrounding roads, rivers, villages, and fields. Cattle pastures will have approximately 50 native trees planted per hectare.  The projects primary goals were to recover and document traditional ecological knowledge of the Lacadon forest and fuse it with Western science to inform scientific experiments and restoration practices for the forest. The project aimed to “convert this rich source of TEK into scientifically validated tools for ecological restoration” (Douterlungne et al., 2010). Restoration goals included eliminating the invasive Bracken fern and regenerating abandoned agricultural lands. The project hoped to arm local farmers and community members with these tools and TEK so they could benefit from ecological restoration efforts. 
Lacadon Maya Farmers 
Local Students – High school students and teachers from agricultural schools were involved in seedling production. Their involvement complied with their social service and pre-professional practice requirements. A total of 250 students and four teachers have been trained thus far in nursery management. El Colegio de la Frontera Sur (ECOSUR) provides the students and teachers a certificate of training and they are provided an economic incentive. 
 

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Elimination of the invasive Bracken fern: the Lacadon Maya use the native tree Balsa (Ochroma pyramidale) to promote accelerated natural succession towards mature tropical forest. The tree grows quickly and shades previously cleared areas, dissuading fern propagation. The Lacadon Maya plant Balsa using the traditional Balsa seed broadcasting method. A study conducted by Douterlungne et al., 2010 found this method to be both highly effective for combating the Bracken fern and a low-resource/cost efficient solution. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Twenty multi-purpose native tree species that seem highly promising and complementary are being used in plots established in abandoned pasture, bracken fields, low fallow and corn fields. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Farmers with grass pastures planted 50 native trees per hectare of pasture and maintain tolches around their property. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): The natural succession rates of abandoned agricultural plots subjected to a variety of treatments (slash and burn vs. traditional methods of controlled burns) was tested. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): In 2005, a large-scale project was undertaken in the community of Nueva Palestina, Lacandon rainforest. Currently, 320 ha of degraded land are under rehabilitation where actions were undertaken to rehabilitate degraded areas on a large scale. Mapping and characterization are being used in addition to scientifically validated TEK based interventions, such as the use of tolches and fundo legal, to promote landscape-level connectivity. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: The recovery and implementation of the agricultural practices based on the traditional ecological knowledge of the Lacadon Maya people allows local farmers to continue making a living from agriculture while preserving and working with the native forest system. Local farmers and the local community were directly involved in this project of recovering knowledge and incentivizing sustainable practices. 
Achieve a desirable species composition: The re-establishment of native trees is re-introducing the appropriate native tree composition to the forest. Reinstate structural diversity: The use of tolches and fundo legal allow the forest to grown around towns and agricultural lands, creating structural diversity in the forest. 

Farmers who graze cattle on large swaths of grass pasture were able to retain structural diversity by just planting 50 native trees per hectare in their pastures. Recover ecosystem functionality: The re-establishment of native trees showing promise for encouraging natural succession of abandoned land plots. The traditional controlled burn and long fallow period with planting of native tree species encouraged high natural succession rates. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: The use of tolches and fundo legal promote landscape-level connectivity.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The project in Nueva Palestine involves 100 Tzeltal farmers. Each farmer owns 2 ha on average, with an economic benefit of US$365/ha/ year. Several government institutions fund rehabilitation costs. The farmers participating in the project have come to rely on these rehabilitation fees as an important source of income.  

Many farmers also keep bees in the forest surrounding the village or the fundo legal. The forest keeps the beehives safe and provides pollen sources for the bees. 

Farmers can continue farming or raising cattle while implementing sustainable traditional methods. The farmers who planted native trees in their pastures were able to also use the trees for firewood, and then re-plant more trees.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: The Lacadon forest has always been an important source of food, medicine, and fuelwood for the Lacadon people, particularly during the long fallow periods in the fields. Rehabilitating the forest and restoring soil fertility in the region ensures continued agricultural success and economic vitality for the community. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: The Lacadon forest plays an important role in the spirituality of the Lacadon people. The tree is a sacred symbol n Mayan cosmogony. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: The tree stands around the village centers and roads mantan cool temperature in the village and protect from the damage caused by annual hurricanes specifically protecting beehives farmers keep. The leaf litter from the forest specifically from Balsa trees protects the soil from eroding quickly. Maintaining trees along the rivers prevents flooding and preserves water quality. 
Western science needs to better recognize and acknowledge the value of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), particularly as it can be utilized in ecological restoration.  TEK specifically pays an important role in predicting and and widely replicating traditional restoration approaches. 
Researchers  must consult and involve traditional farmers as experts in the design and implementation of their research. TEK needs to expand to be understood and utilized in scientific experimentation, rather than just descriptive studies. 
Restoration strategies which incorporate TEK are more likely to be adopted by local people. Studies should be pursued which validate TEK and better inform the design of such restoration strategies. 
Forestry expert Francisco Román states in Raices Mayas, a 2011 film about traditional land management in the Lacandon forest: ‘I confess that before getting involved with these farmers I thought that the word ‘traditional’ meant a certain orthodoxy—old fashioned ways that rarely change though adaptable to contemporary situations. But now I see that these traditional farmers really have an open and innovative spirit. They are, in fact, the vanguard.’22 Indeed,  traditional ecological techniques ‘may be rooted in the distant past but turn out to be quite new to our eyes.’ 
 In 2010 the rehabilitation process areas were monitored in order to evaluate the survival and growth of trees planted in different conditions. From this information, intervention strategies were improved (made more efficient) for the use of species, costs and benefits. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/sri-lanka-learning-from-failure-mixed-results-of-post-tsunami-mangrove-restoration/	Sri Lanka: Learning from Failure – Mixed Results of Post-tsunami Mangrove Restoration	Sri Lanka	2004	2015	"In 2004, the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami invigorated the Sri Lankan government and people to turn their attention to restoring the country’s mangrove stands to prevent such catastrophic damage from future disasters. It has an area of approximately square 65,610km with a coastline of about 1,620km on the Indian Ocean. Mangrove restoration projects were launched in Sri Lanka covering over 2,000 hectares. However, over 80% of these projects failed. Kondikara et al. 2017 conducted an assessment of the success of 23 mangrove restoration projects implemented following the 2004 tsunami. Their assessment consisted of an ecological (e.g. species planted), social (e.g. drivers of planting initiatives), and economic assessment. The lessons learned from both the failures and successes of mangrove restoration can be used to inform the design, coordination, and implementation of other mangrove restoration projects.Fire & Weather Events, Fisheries & Aquaculture, Fragmentation Sri Lanka was severely affected by the 2004 tsunami including many of the mangrove stands. Prior to the tsunami, many mangroves and potential planting sites were impacted by resource extraction (firewood, timber) and shrimp farming.  The reference ecosystem is primarily based on contemporary reference sites or existing analogues of the pre-degradation ecosystem.Compared to other Southeast Asian countries, there has been considerable research on mangroves in Sri Lanka. This research provides a baseline for the reference ecosystem. 
The projects are situated in all four different climate zones, that is, wet, dry, intermediate, and arid zones. However, the proportion of sites was different in these four zones: 52% of the planted sites were situated in the dry and arid climatic zones, 30% in the wet zone, and the rest, that is, 18%, are in the intermediate zone.  5,009ha of mangrove cover is found in the dry and arid zones, 644ha in the intermediate zone, and 430ha in the wet zone. However, mangrove cover between 1983 and 2003 was reduced by about 2,450ha in the dry and arid zones. 
Survival rate of planted seedlings for at least 5 years was used as the indicator for success. Specifically, the survival of Rhizophora mucronata was assessed.  Attention was also paid to soil conditions and topographic position of the restored area. 
  
Coastal protection against tsunami events.
Mangrove regeneration


The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Many of the mangrove restoration projects were a collaboration between Sri Lankan government, foreign governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). However, there was often a lack of proper coordination between each of these institutions. The key actors involved in planting initiatives can be broadly categorized as governmental or nongovernmental organizations (national and international). The governmental organizations include the Coastal Conservation Department, Regional Forest Departments, the University of Ruhuna, the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency. IUCN and Mericarp are the international NGOs, while Galle project, Sewalanka, Turtle Conservation Project, Saviya Development Foundation, and Small Fishers Federation of Lanka are local NGOs. In addition, there were five unidentified internationally affiliated NGOs that have attempted mangrove restoration in Sri Lanka in the past decade.
Local coastal communities were tasked with the actual implementation of restoration work, but often were not educated about the technical requirements of this restoration work and had little oversight. 

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Local communities were not effectively involved in the implementation process and widespread political support and political cohesion between partners was not achieved. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: Since the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, approximately 1,000–1,200ha of mangroves have been planted. However, planting agencies did select sites based on soil/substrate composition, climate, or topography. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Planting agencies did not survey which species occur naturally in the area nor did they use nearby natural forests as reference sites as recommended in restoration guides.  
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Many of the restored sites experienced continual high level of disturbance following planting efforts. Such disturbance included cattle trampling and browsing. Political support for shrimp farming, which destroys mangrove habitat, is still widespread. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: The current total surviving planted area is only about 200–220ha of the original 1,000-2,000 hectares of restored mangrove. 

Soil pH for the study sites ranged from 7.1 to 5.8. The sites in the wet zone showed significantly lower pH values (p=0.0003; sig. level 0.001) as compared to the rest. SBD ranged from 1.22 to 1.89g/cm3. The bulk densities were significantly lower (p=0.03; sig. level 0.05) in the arid zone. Redox potential at 30 and 50cm ranged from +6 to−146mV and −43 to −171mV, respectively. Redox potential at 30cm was relatively higher in the intermediate and wet zones than in the dry and arid zones. Below a depth of 30cm, redox potential varied between −100 and −200mV. However, there was no significant difference of redox potential at 30 and 50cm between the different climate zones. Achieve a desirable species composition: The large majority of seedlings planted were of Rhizophora spp., that is, 97% of the total planted propagules and seedlings, rather than selecting and planting native mangrove species. Selecting inappropriate mangrove species for the area was a leading cause of restoration failure. Reinstate structural diversity: The average height of planted mangroves in Thambalangama, Rekawa, Galle, Negombo, Pambala, and Kalpitiya was found to be 4–6m in 8–10 years. However, stunted growth and crooked saplings were observed in the project sites situated in Panama, Panakala, and Halawa. Recover ecosystem functionality: Thirty-six (36) planting attempts out of 67 (54% of the total) showed no surviving plants. Two-thirds of these complete failures were recorded in the dry and arid zones. In total, for all the project sites, the level of survival (based on the dead/alive criterion) varied from 0 to 78%. Even after several planting attempts 40% of the sites had failed (9 out of 23 had no surviving plants). Further, the level of survival for 16 of the project sites was lower than 10%. Only three sites had a survival rate over 50%. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: The placement of plants at locations with inappropriate topography which subjects them to too short or too long periods of depth, duration, and frequency of inundation, either from local rainfall or local tides, or a combination of both, has been the key factor. In addition, crucial factors for planting success such as awareness of the history of the sites including species composition, hydrological requirements, optimum depth of substrate, and freshwater input were ignored in most of our study sites Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: There were multiple planting initiatives by different agencies within the same sites. Sixty-seven planting initiatives were recorded within these 23 sites. Many planting attempts could be observed in tsunami-affected areas Many failed mangrove restoration project sites could be observed in the tsunami-affected areas, while the most successful restoration sites were in areas less affected by the tsunami. 
Additionally, the restored sites were situated in a wide range of topographic positions. Some planting efforts were situated at the high intertidal area and even beyond, in abandoned swamps, and meadows, while some were in the low intertidal zone. Inappropriate topographic positioning such as this subjects mangrove seedlings to several stress factors and disturbances. 

Indications of stress factors and disturbances (drought, smothering, high irradiance, flooding, algal accumulation, infestation by barnacles, browsing, and cattle trampling) (Fig. 6) were observed in all restoration sites. Cattle trampling and browsing were ubiquitous. 

 The occurrence of some types of stress factors and disturbances were related to the climate zone. For instance, mangrove seedlings/propagules planted in the low intertidal area were exposed to long-term submergence due to heavy rains in the wet zone while mangrove seedlings/propagules at the higher intertidal area suffered due to drought and high irradiance.

Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: The success of mangrove restoration are also critical from a financial and risk-assessment perspective as human lives may depend on the coastal protection claimed to be offered by these planting initiatives. Thus, when these projects fail, negative consequences include increased financial and risk for communities impacted by lack of coastal protection. 
No political support exists for mangrove planting while shrimp farming extends under political patronage. 
Mangrove restoration has multiple important benefits socioeconomically providing natural resources, preventing natural disaster damage, and ecologically. As such, mangrove restoration involves coordination between multiple institutions both foreign and local. These institutions must have structured coordination to ensure proper communication and each stage of the project. 
It is important to involve local coastal communities in mangrove restoration efforts, but these communities must be provided adequate technical education and oversight about which species to plant in which areas. 
Political support for restoration is critical. 
Destructive activities such as fisheries and firewood collection must be effectively discouraged for restoration to be effective in the long term. 
Restoration efforts are far less successful in dry and arid zones. 
Mangrove restoration projects which are scientifically/technically guided are more successful than those guided primarily by donors. Technical guidance means recognizing basic principles like understanding autecology of mangrove species, and the normal hydrology of the sites, assessing appropriate modifications to hydrology, selecting restoration sites based on technical, political, social, and economic considerations, planting mangroves only as needed. 
Ignorance of the major ecological drivers of mangrove health such as requirements for salinity, hydrology, and appropriate species composition were the main causes for mangrove restoration failure. 
Inappropriate site selection is a major driver of mangrove restoration failure. 
Lack of maintenance and monitoring also led to restoration failure, even in technically-guided restoration sites. 
 Nation-wide evaluations of planting initiatives in the Southeast Asian region, where the bulk of global mangroves occur and where most mangrove restoration has taken place, are worthwhile for informing future restoration efforts and where to invest resources. 
Planting mangroves in areas that have undergone major changes or in areas where mangroves were never reported should be preceded by a scientific assessment of whether or not mangroves can grow there.
 Mangrove planting may not always be the best method for coastal protection. Scientific assessments should be conducted and sometimes other bioshield methods investigated. 
 In an effort to deliver completed results quickly, many of the Sri Lankan restoration projects were implemented without investing much time in the planning and long-term monitoring. 
Ten sites demonstrated some monitoring efforts post-planting. Post-planting monitoring was identified as removing flotsam, debris, and attached barnacles, up-righting fallen seedlings/propagules, avoiding cattle trampling, and secured fencing and frequent site visits, and replacing dead seedlings/propagules. Survival rate was significantly correlated with post-planting care and soil parameters except soil pH. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/the-blaauwberg-large-scale-sand-fynbos-restoration-project-cape-town/	The Blaauwberg large-scale Sand Fynbos restoration project, Cape Town	South Africa	2012-06	2021-12	"The project addresses restoration of critically endangered Cape Flats Sand Fynbos in Cape Town. In 2012 funding was sourced to clear 96 ha of dense Acacia saligna stands and to investigate optimal restoration approaches while promoting co-learning among stakeholders. 32 ha were cleared using “Fell & Burn” and the remainder by “Fell & Stack” methods. Follow-up control was done annually. Native seed was collected from nearby remnants and some propagation done to reintroduce species into cleared highly degraded areas.
The first two research projects investigated optimal restoration approaches, including seed germination cues and establishment in a range of native species. The collaboration attracted other students who studied small mammals, ants, soil microbiology and nutrients in relation to wattle invasion.
The initial treatments restored some native vegetation cover but not the required vegetation structure and composition. More research is needed to improve establishment of under-represented guilds, such as resprouter ericoid-leaved shrubs. Another limitation is the dearth of native remnants to supply seeds and material for propagation, therefore more efficient ways to establish species from seed and/or rootstock are needed. It is proposed to study seed coating technologies for direct sowing and tubestock for more efficient production in the nursery.Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) The Blaauwberg Nature Reserve encompasses 400 ha of critically endangered Cape Flats Sand Fynbos, most of which is highly degraded following long invasion (pre-1950s in some areas) by the Australian wattle, Acacia saligna. Most areas are either devoid of indigenous vegetation under the wattle trees or have very low and sparse indigenous cover. The fynbos shrubland has been replaced by a dense alien woodland with sparse, open understory. Local biodiversity is completely extirpated except in a few scattered remnants that have experienced lower or more recent invasion impacts. Although the sandy soils have never been ploughed, indigenous seed banks are depleted and have been replaced by dense wattle seed banks (8-10,000 seeds/m2). Ecological function has changed: soils in alien stands have elevated total nitrogen concentration owing to the N-fixing capabilities and higher leaf litter inputs by the wattles compared to fynbos shrubland. These stands of wattle have low grazing value but have some limited socio-economic value for informal wood-cutters. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on contemporary reference sites or existing analogues of the pre-degradation ecosystem.Cape Flats Sand Fynbos is a dense, moderately tall, ericoid-leaved shrubland, with scattered emergent tall shrubs, and occurs on undulating to flat sandy plains. The reference community has a proteoid overstory and ericoid shrubs and restioids (graminoids with photosynthetic stems) also are prominent components. Fire in the summer dry season is an important ecosystem driver and many species are obligate reseeders, recruiting from the soil seed bank or canopy-held seed in the winter post-fire. However resprouting perennial species form half of the vegetation cover and are an important structural component. Ephemeral geophytes (dormant in summer) may be prominent post-fire and are an important biodiversity component. Local, less disturbed natural remnants and structurally similar adjacent Sand Fynbos with persisting intact natural habitat (Atlantis Sand Fynbos), were used as reference sites. Vegetation guild structure and soil characteristics in reference communities were used as benchmarks for restoring ecosystem structure and function at the restoration site. To date, we attempted to restore a variety of species in each of the major structural guilds, focusing on the more common species because intact remnants with seed sources are few. Owing to predictions of warmer, drier conditions and more frequent fires under climate change, resprouter shrubs are viewed as a key guild to restore. Restoration success was assessed in the research component of the project by comparing treated plots with reference plots in terms of cover, density and richness of growth forms (including regeneration mode of resprouter or reseeder). 1. To restore degraded Cape Flats Sand Fynbos in the Blaauwberg Nature Reserve.
2. To contribute to the body of research documenting successful and cost-effective alien vegetation control and active restoration methodologies. The proposed future research will investigate technologies to improve establishment of resprouter ericoid shrubs and threatened plant species that do not establish well from direct sowing of pre-treated seeds in the field. This will include testing seed coat technologies and more cost-effective production of rooted material using tubestock/ plug production in the nursery.
3. To provide operational support to enable large-scale ecological restoration and research by clearing stands of invasive alien trees and collecting indigenous seed and propagating cutting material for restoration.
4. To train restoration ecologists at post-graduate level, as well as to train and provide employment for local contract teams in alien clearance and seed collecting methods.

Monitoring Details: The research component serves as the main monitoring program for restoration of fynbos vegetation. Some of the initial vegetation monitoring plots set up by a post-graduate student in 2012 continue to be monitored by City Biodiversity Management staff. In addition, staff monitor invasive species re-emergence and plan follow-up control in response to this. Start date, including baseline data collection: May 2012 End Date: 2021 or later if we are successful in securing additional funds to continue restoration of the 400 ha.
1. City of Cape Town, Biodiversity Management Branch, including: Conservation Services, Blaauwberg Nature Reserve Management, Invasive Species and Restoration Facility staff, students and interns. When the project was first initiated in 2012, the project coordinator (Patricia Holmes) worked for the Biodiversity Management Branch and initiated many of the partnerships below.
2. Stellenbosch University Conservation Ecology & Entomology Department staff and post-graduate students. Restoration ecology research has been a parallel stream to implementation from the beginning in order to foster co-learning between research and management. So far seven post-graduates (Honours to PhD level) have contributed to the body of knowledge (see Resources section) with another two recently appointed.
3. Stellenbosch University Centre for Invasion Biology in the Biological Sciences Department, supported some of the post-graduate students involved in this restoration ecology research.
4. Kirstenbosch Botanic Gardens Millenium Seed Bank Project and Conservation Programme staff. The Millenium Seed Bank Partnership at Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, UK, provided the initial project funding for two post-graduate research projects in restoration ecology based at Stellenbosch University, in return for new species collections for the seed bank.
5. The Hans Hoheisen Trust has provided funding for the current phase of the project, including the clearance of another 24 ha of alien-invaded fynbos (to be implemented from July 2019) and the associated research component comprising two post-graduate (PhD and MSc) students.
6. Friends of Blaauwberg community volunteers: the reserve has an active community of volunteers, some of whom assist with field work, including alien control and seed collecting activities.
7. Contractors appointed for invasive species clearance and indigenous species seed collection and propagation. The City Biodiversity Management Branch staff ensure that new contractors and their team members receive appropriate training to conduct the work.
In the initial stages of the project (2012-2015), meetings were convened by the project leader separately with the operational staff and research staff and students. The researchers and students regularly presented their research work at university research days and local fora, such as the Fynbos Forum, attended by researchers, conservation managers and other stakeholders. In addition, local project workshops were held for the primary stakeholders to feedback on project progress, discuss challenges and plan for future research and operational requirements.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: To date 96 ha of alien-invaded fynbos has been cleared, with follow-up clearing conducted annually. In order to conduct restoration research at large scale, 32 ha were cleared using a “Fell and Burn” treatment, with a prescribed burn conducted at the end of the dry season to remove alien biomass, stimulate residual fynbos soil seed banks and prepare a seed bed for sowing. For comparison, 32 ha cleared using a “Fell and Stack” treatment in which burning of stacked slash material was done during winter. The areas outside of these 64 ha research generally had higher ground cover of fynbos under the wattles and were cleared using the “Fell and Stack” method. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: The large woody alien biomass was burned to remove the tall woodland vegetation structure as an important first step. The “Fell and Burn” treatment was used to potentially volatilize some of the excess nitrogen accumulated in the wattle litter and topsoil. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: In areas with higher restoration potential, removal of the wattles alone was deemed sufficient to promote good recovery and composition of fynbos, although the overstory proteoid shrubs with canopy stored seeds (such as Protea repens and P. scolymocephala) were locally extirpated. One research projected assessed the impact of three different follow-up control methods (with and without herbicide) on species composition to advise on the best approach in a restoration context. 
In highly degraded areas, native seed banks were depleted and it is necessary to re-introduce all components by seed or propagated material. Different seed mixes were trialled across the site at plot scale in the “Fell and Burn” treatment. Pre-treating seeds with smoke and heat shock was also investigated as a means to improve establishment success. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): The restoration species were selected to encompass the major growth forms and regeneration modes (obligate reseeder and resprouter) with a view to restoring structural diversity. Owing to the dearth of remaining natural remnants in this critically endangered ecosystem, only the more common species were targeted for seed collection. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): A burning treatment was trialled to test the hypothesis that removal of the thick, nutrient-rich wattle litter layer would return the soil nutrient status to the reference condition. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Blaauwberg Nature Reserve is at the edge of urban Cape Town, with agriculture to the north and the Atlantic Ocean on the western boundary. Restoration of the Sand Fynbos will increase the suitable habitat area and improve the linkage across ecotones to the two other threatened lowland ecosystems on site, namely Swartland Shale Renosterveld and Cape Flats Dune Strandveld. Antelope and other mammals have free access to these three vegetation types, although a major road bisects the strandveld. Fencing restricts movement of the larger mammals, but smaller mammals, reptiles and birds, including predators, can move more freely. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: The appointed contractor teams were upskilled in methods of alien clearance, safety, health, and nature conservation among other topics. Local volunteers and Biodiversity Management staff accompanied the research team in the field where mutual exchange of knowledge could take place, for example during seed collecting activities. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: To date 96 ha of alien-invaded fynbos has been cleared, with follow-up clearing conducted annually to remove this major threat. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: Combustion of the large woody alien biomass removed the unnaturally high biomass and tall woodland vegetation structure as an important first step. Where an understory of fynbos persisted, the indigenous vegetation recovered passively. 
In terms of soil chemistry, in the “Fell and Burn” treatment, phosphorus and nitrogen remained higher than the reference site a year after clearing, despite combustion of the biomass and wattle litter layer. In the “Fell and Stack” treatment NO3- as well as total N increased within a year after initial clearing to higher levels, and P remained higher, compared to the reference site. These soil differences may take more than one fire-cycle of restored fynbos to revert to reference conditions. Achieve a desirable species composition: In highly degraded areas, native seed banks were depleted: density of the total indigenous perennial seedbank was estimated to be 0.44/m2, with only two species, and 1.76/m2 with six species for ephemeral geophytes. Annual forbs and graminoids were dominated by alien species, and comprised 11.22/m2 with nine species and 4.62/m2 with four species respectively. The alien wattles emerged en masse after fire and follow-up clearing was expensive, requiring foliar herbicide application. This caused some mortality in non-target, native dicotyledonous species. 
The trial to investigate different follow-up alien clearing methods showed that herbicide had a negative impact on indigenous species richness, therefore where feasible alternative methods should be used. These include hand pulling young saplings or cutting below the root crown to prevent resprouting of the alien.
Sowing treatments were found to be essential to re-instate native species in low restoration potential areas. Pre-treating the seeds with smoke and in certain taxa heat shock or dry after-ripening, improved establishment. However, the developing vegetation community was less diverse than the reference. Reinstate structural diversity: The sown plots created nodes of restored vegetation across the 64 ha experimentally cleared area. However, even in the seed pre-treatment plots, vegetation structure did not converge with that of the reference site. Obligately reseeding shrubs dominated while resprouter ericoid shrubs and Restionaceae were under-represented. Alternative methods to improve establishment of the latter guilds in the field need to be investigated. Recover ecosystem functionality: Nutrient cycling has not yet been studied for the restored areas, but enhanced nitrogen was shown to persist for at least ten years post-clearance of the wattle. Informal student projects indicated that indigenous ants (important fynbos seed dispersers) persisted in degraded areas, and further research has been proposed to investigate restoration of pollinator networks. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: The initial phase of Sand Fynbos restoration has opened up new habitat for fauna and facilitates their movement across ecotones to link with the renosterveld and strandveld vegetation in the reserve. Future expansion of Cape Town will limit the extent to which the reserve can link to the surrounding areas. However the Biodiversity Network of the City of Cape Town indicates where linking corridors of natural remnant or degraded land around the reserve should be conserved to provide for such external exchanges. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: In burned areas it was necessary to control wattle regrowth with herbicide which has a negative impact on recovering native species. Some species did not establish well from seed, especially the prominent resprouter ericoid shrub guild and better ways to establish these species needs to be researched.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The contractor teams appointed reside in the northern region of Cape Town where the reserve also is situated. This means that the financial benefits of employment remain in the region.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: as above Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: Local reserve volunteers have been involved in the restoration project from the start and continue to give their support. The wattle clearance has opened up spectacular vistas of Table Mountain, improving the aesthetics of the reserve as well as its habitat value. The restoration area was recently donated to the reserve because of its cultural heritage importance as the site of the 1806 Battle of Blaauwberg in which the British wrested control of the Cape from the Batavians (Dutch), changing the history of South Africa. Clearance of the wattles has facilitated access for the archaeological team to operate and conduct their research. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: Restoration of wattle stands to fynbos has been shown in other areas to lower water loss through evapotranspiration, thus completion of the restoration project is likely to restore water tables to a more natural level. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: No. The project is conducted within the boundaries of a proclaimed nature reserve, the primary objective of which is to conserve its unique biodiversity and cultural heritage. When the wattles were cleared without burning (Fell & Stack method), the altered soil conditions promoted competitive grasses and secondary weed invasions. There is a window of opportunity during the first year to re-introduce fynbos species by seed or rootstock after which competition with the herbaceous weed layer is likely to be severe. Thereafter, controlling the herbaceous weeds can be resource-intensive. Where feasible, follow-up control of wattles should be manual with the minimal use of herbicides, particularly foliar application. A new project has just been initiated to investigate restoration using pre-treated seed in areas cleared without burning.
When the wattles were cleared followed by a prescribed burn (Fell & Burn method), the accumulated leaf litter is removed to create a good seed bed and soil nitrogen is reduced, though not to reference site level. The prescribed burn also reduces the establishment of herbaceous weeds. However, heat-shock adapted wattles germinate and establish as a dense layer, making it prohibitively expensive to conduct manual follow-up clearance at large scale. In such areas, foliar herbicide application currently is the only practical method to use. If indigenous dicotyledonous species are not protected from herbicide spray they may be killed during follow-up operations that use herbicides.
Post-fire sowing experiments indicated that pre-treatment of seeds with smoke and heat shock improved establishment in a number of species. However, the important structural components of resprouter ericoid shrubs and Restionaceae were under-represented and alternative methods for establishment of these guilds in the field should be researched further.
As the few remaining remnants of Cape Flats Sand Fynbos are degraded, and this ecosystem is considered critically endangered, it is a top priority to restore. Forty threatened fynbos species occur on site, mostly in low number, and suitable propagation methods for many of these need to be investigated in order to restore subpopulations in the restored areas of the reserve to ensure long-term persistence. The 96 ha of land cleared of wattle will continue to be managed by Blaauwberg Nature Reserve staff with follow-up control of regenerating wattle conducted as needed, in collaboration with the Invasive Species Unit.
When funding becomes available additional tracts of degraded Sand Fynbos (300 ha still to clear) will be cleared of wattle and the areas actively restored using a combination of seed and rootstock implemented by the restoration facility staff. This has to be done in stages owing to the limitation of available native seed and propagation material remaining in the wild. Research into improved establishment methods for key structural guilds and threatened species will be conducted in parallel to implementation, in order to improve efficiency and outcomes. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/nusa-islands-coral-reef-restoration-project-bali-indonesia/	Nusa Islands Coral Reef Restoration Project – Bali, Indonesia	Indonesia	2018- 03	2023-12	"The Nusa Islands Restoration Project was started in 2018 as an attempt to reverse the degradation of reef areas along the northern coastline of Nusa Penida Island, Bali, Indonesia. The reef is an important source of income from tourism activities (diving & snorkeling), but has been subjected to a variety of impacts resulting in mechanical damage and unstable rubble. Impacted areas are not recovering naturally, but are rather increasing in size. Therefore, restoration is needed in an area of reef flat and reef slope in order to stabilize the rubble substrate and stimulate coral recovery. The project started in April 2018 and is an ongoing effort spanning an area of approximately 150m x 20m of reef. The project includes physical components (coated metal frames and mesh rubble fencing) as well as biological components (coral transplantation, coral nursery).Fisheries & Aquaculture, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry, Other The restoration site has been subjected to several impacts resulting in mechanical damage and unstable rubble:

Anchoring of boats and inadequate moorings
Clearing coral areas for pontoon tourism
Clearing of reef at areas for seaweed farming
Increased erosion from reinforced shoreline
Historical dragging of fish traps across reef flat

The rubble area has shown little signs of natural recovery over the previous seven years that the site has been observed. Rubble areas are highly mobile and are showing signs of eroding down the reef slope increasing the size of the impact footprint.
Little recruitment survival are seen in rubble areas. There is reduced reef health compared to adjacent reef areas, due to the impact site being 100% rubble. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Reference ecosystem was based on surveys of adjacent reef areas, underwater photos of the area from previous years, and identification of coral rubble skeletons present at restoration site:
The targets for restoration were set from surveys of adjacent reef along the coastline from the restoration site. This area has the same depths, current & wave exposure and reef slope angle. We assume historic base-point of the restoration site would have had similar species composition. Our aim is therefore to restore hard coral community to a similar point.
This adjacent reference site was also used as the donor site for sourcing coral transplants. The primary goals are to increase ecosystem function and habitat complexity. It is an important reef to the area for tourism, as well as ecologically important being within a marine park.
The primary methods are to introduce simple structures to provide the framework for which fast growing hard coral species can then use for expanding across the rubble area. The foundation coral species will then attract settlement of successional communities in turn increasing ecosystem function.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Lembongan Marine Association together with Komunitas Penyulam Lembongan are committed to reducing impacts on the reef through community education and adopting codes of conduct for responsible marine tourism operators. We work together with these local community organizations and have been conducting workshops for the local dive and marine tourism professionals in these two organizations to train them in basic marine ecology and coral restoration techniques.
This project is financed through private donations, fundraising events and volunteers. Our aim is to use a technique which is inexpensive and feasible with the personnel and resources already present in the community.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: The marine park management has implemented a zoning system within the park as to which activities are permitted within zones. The restoration site has been designated protected area and so the previous boat anchoring and fishing impacts are now reduced. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: The site is in a high current area at the terminus of the Indonesian-Through-Flow ocean current. Therefore the structural restoration techniques required needed to be designed to handle strong forces from high water currents. 
Broken coral substrate is unstable and shifts in the currents causing erosion to adjacent areas. Therefore substrate stabilization was first required before beginning biological restoration. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Target species composition based on surveys of adjacent healthy areas of reef. A list of target species was compiled in appropriate proportions according to water depth and reef zone. 
Additionally studies in recovering areas were done to determine successional coral community species so that habitat forming foundation species were utilized for the initial biological restoration efforts ( transplantations). How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Many coated metal frames measuring 1 sq meter each in size were used in a modular fashion to reinstate reef structure. Additionally rubble fencing was used to trap and stabilize shifting rubble. 
Immediately after installing structures mobile organisms (certain fish and invertebrates) began to utilize the site. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): By transplanting select species of coral, it stimulated natural settlement of secondary substrate-forming species (including soft corals, sponges, hydroids, etc). Mobile grazing organisms (such as parrotfish and butterfly fish) began to use the area and attracted both predators and stimulated the settlement of invertebrates. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): The site is being monitored to determine if the transplanted corals will begin sexually reproducing in the next spawning season.  Transplants were taken from multiple parents so that the restoration plan included genetic diversity of corals. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: Regular training events take place with local marine tourism operators. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Anchoring and illegal fishing are reduced in the area, however enforcement is a challenge for the marine park so some destructive activities persist. With increases in tourism in the area it will be a continuous challenge to promote environmentally responsible behaviours by both tourists and the business operators. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: The structures which have been introduced into the restoration site have been trapping rubble and creating a topographical complexity to the reef which did not exist in its disturbed state. Achieve a desirable species composition: Settlement of secondary substrate-forming species is beginning to happen both upon the modified substrate as well as trapped rubble patches. Reinstate structural diversity: Structure and habitat complexity has increased as is measured during reef rugosity measurements. Also can be seen by site usage by fish and other mobile organisms. Recover ecosystem functionality: By transplanting select species of coral, it stimulated natural settlement of secondary substrate-forming species (including soft corals, sponges, hydroids, etc). Mobile grazing organisms (such as parrotfish and butterfly fish) began to use the area and attracted both predators and stimulated the settlement of invertebrates. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: The area of reef has a high level of connectivity with surrounding reef areas so we see a lot of overlapping usage by mobile organisms between the restoration and healthy reef areas. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The project is run by donations and volunteers, so limited financial resources allow only small areas of reef to undergo restoration at a time.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Local marine tourism professionals have been visiting the site regularly with their guests. Tourism is the sole industry in the area so empowerment of the local community to believe that degraded ecosystems can be restored is one of our primary goals.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: The local community are starting to understand that a healthy coral reef means satisfied tourists and returning customers to their businesses. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/harbor-brook-daylighting-project-meriden-connecticut/	Harbor Brook Daylighting Project, Meriden, Connecticut	United States of America	1970-01	2016-06	"Central Meriden, located in New Haven County, Connecticut, is continuously devastated by flooding. Centuries of urbanization and loss of wetland habitats have led to these ruinous disturbances. Local resident taxes, along with resources provided by the Environmental Protection Agency, furnished the rehabilitation project of the main “Hub” of Meriden. Milone & MacBroom, Inc. were called upon to analyze and develop a plan for reform. Economic development and reduction of flooding hazards were achieved by constructing a program to daylight Harbor Brook, a waterway that had been covered by industrialization. Development of the water budget required an analysis of the characteristics of the large scale watershed, the entire corridor, and the channel itself, segment by segment. Topographical data and models of hydrology were used to develop runoff hydrographs and route them through the watershed. Businesses in the Hub were relocated and 1700 linear feet of concrete culverts over 30 feet wide were demolished, excavated, and removed (Milone & MacBroom, Inc, n.d.). The elimination and reconstruction involved manufacturing a Town Green to be used as a watershed for impending storms, as well as a gathering place for public events.Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological), Dams & Hydrology, Fire & Weather Events, Fragmentation The major goal of this daylighting project was to re-naturalize the river that runs through the
city. In the past, the river was subject to flooding which caused damage to surrounding business. The goal of daylighting the river was to create an area to store flood water to help protect the 50,000 people who occupy the downtown area. The goal of fish repopulating the waters along with the ability for recreation is important to the city and its citizens. This was made to look attractive as well, increasing surrounding property value, and encouraging people to use the area.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The biggest threat is flooding of Harbor Brook Park after rainstorms. With these storms can come hurricanes and high winds. Because of the bowl shape of the land, this was a high flood area, and water often engulfed the whole park and surrounding streets. This area is a watershed zone, so water will always be present.  Factories historically dumped heavy metals and other pollutants into the river before it was covered by a shopping mall, which raised the flood zone and made flooding worse for the surrounding area. The shopping mall was eventually removed for remediation. The factories were either removed, or re-located. This was relatively effective, although flood waters are still able to rise to the streets during big storms. Overall, the nearby businesses causing pollution, as well as other buildings, and the mall were moved. This was effective based on the goals of the remediation project. 

Before this area was populated heavily, it would have been a natural wetland area. Every year there would be a normal expectancy of the level of flood waters across that area. Once the impairment of the city happened, the land was built up,  and created a Brooke type waterway that was dug deeper, which would fill the Brooke during floods. This would push the water level higher during big floods. This loss of land was detrimental due to the need for open wetland space, not a congested city. The threat to the wetlands was the loss of wetland area that allowed the water to disburse more naturally. The park restoration was more effective at holding this bigger sum of water, because of the big bowl shape that was created. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: The brownfield created by the factories was properly removed. The landscape was then re-shaped with the exposed stream running through the middle. This better collects flood water, and prevents clogging of the old culverts. This was a large step in the remediation process, but still didn’t re-create the wetland habitat that was previously there. Achieve a desirable species composition: Native species of plants are being planted along the river to create a riparian zone. Recovery of fish populations was also a goal of this project. The effectiveness of the project in achieving the desired species composition is limited by the amount of space there is in the park, as well as how often landscapers and ground crews limit growth. Reinstate structural diversity: Engineers planned an uneven riverbed to replicate a natural setting. Also, downed logs were added to produce quality habitat for aquatic species. Rocks were also strategically placed in the river to replicate the kind of water flow that occurs in a natural environment. Recover ecosystem functionality: The area is already showing signs of species repopulating the area. These systems are able to recover easily due to less risk of flooding which would previously disturbed the landscape. Less pollution also enters the river as a result moving or removing buildings/brownfields. However, this does not replicate the original wetland ecosystem that once existed.

Ongoing monitoring will still occur for the project. Water quality will be monitored, along with the species that continue to occupy the area. The flooding prevention plan is something that will continue to be ongoing to make sure areas of the city aren’t getting flooded. This will inevitably benefit ecosystem functionality by reducing external degradation factors caused by humans, and allowing plants and animals a more clean/natural habitat. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: The plan for the future is to daylight more of the river further upstream and take down some of the old rundown buildings. Once the buildings are gone the daylighting project should continue to the parts of the river that are still underground.

During the last few decades, these environments have undergone major changes, including the drainage of more than 60% of Finland’s original peatland area for large-scale forestry. Drainage and alterations in hydrology have also resulted in the loss of open water areas and the habitat they provide for birds. The restoration measures being undertaken as part of the Hydrology LIFE project are aimed at recovering these degraded ecosystems and habitats towards the original state vital for many valuable species, and improving the important functions these systems provide for humans, including flood protection, water quality, and game areas.Dams & Hydrology, Fragmentation Majority of peatlands in Finland are severely degraded by forestry-drainage, including also areas within protected N2000 sites. Drainage lowers water table and results in degradation of original wet ecosystem structure and functions. Degradation degree: medium.
Dredging, channelization and drainage are widely decreasing the ability of streams and ponds to sustain their natural communities and control the circulation of water. Degradation degree: medium.
The open water areas and mosaics of water and vegetation, that are important as bird nesting and breeding habitat, are decreasing in many lakes due to overgrowth by vegetation and nutrient loading from the surroundings. Degradation degree: medium.
  The reference ecosystem is primarily based on contemporary reference sites or existing analogues of the pre-degradation ecosystem.Natural-state peatlands, streams and ponds are used as target reference ecosystem. For birdlakes, various information on the preferred ecosystem condition suitable for target species are used. The blocking of ditches and removal of trees on 5200 hectares in and around 95 Natura 2000 sites recovers the wet and open habitats crucial for many valuable species. The measures also restore peatland’s ability to store water, nutrients and carbon. New methods for simultaneously improving biodiversity conservation and water protection are developed.
We restore 34 km of degraded streams and raise water table in 17 ponds to recover their natural hydrological functioning, and to regain valuable species.
We create open water areas and increase the mosaic structure of habitats e.g. by dredging and raising the water table to improve the habitat quality on four especially important bird lakes.

Monitoring Details: The wide range of inventories and long-term monitoring up to 10-15 yr after restoration by the project provide invaluable data on how restoration can be used to preserve the biodiversity, to improve water quality and to slow down climate change. Biodiversity monitoring covers plant communities in ca. 150 sites across the country, lake flora and fauna and protected bats. Hydrology is analysed in ca 40 sites.

The information gained by examining how local people and the recreational users of protected areas feel about restoration can be used to develop restoration measures. Start date, including baseline data collection: 2008 End Date: 2022

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/ecohydrological-restoration-of-burns-bog-british-columbia-canada/	Ecohydrological restoration of Burns Bog, British Columbia, Canada	Canada	2001-01	ongoing	"Burns Bog is a 3,000 ha raised bog located in southwest British Columbia, Canada. Beginning in the 1930s, the bog underwent 50 years of industrial peat extraction, resulting in an extensive network of drainage ditches that lowered the water table and allowed the establishment of trees and other non-bog plant species. Much of the original margin of the bog has been converted to other land uses, such as industrial operations and agriculture. In 2004, Burns Bog was purchased by four levels of government for ecological conservation and is being actively restored with ditch blocking. Long-term monitoring since 2005 has shown a gradual increase or stabilizing of the water table across most of the bog. The edges of the bog continue to be drained by ditches adjacent to farms; restoration efforts are now being focused on these areas. Invasive species are being actively managed, and experimental tree removal is taking place. Greenhouse gas fluxes are being monitored to assess the ability of the bog to sequester carbon in the long term. In 2013, Burns Bog was designated as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance.Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Mining & Resource Extraction Peat was extracted from Burns Bog during the 1930s-1980s. The operation involved the installation of an extensive network of drainage ditches, as well as removal of vegetation and peat across the majority of the bog. The drainage ditches resulted in a lowering of the water table in the bog, leading to the establishment of trees and a reduction in the coverage of Sphagnum mosses. The edges of the bog were converted to other land uses such as agriculture and industrial operations. Although a large-scale ditch blocking program is taking place in the interior of the bog, part of the bog margin remains at risk of drainage due to adjacent farm ditches. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Based on surveyors’ notes from the late 1800s and 1927, as well as paleoecological studies in the late 1970s, Burns Bog was historically characterized by open heath (including Rhododendron groenlandicum, Vaccinium oxycoccos, Vaccinium uliginosum, Kalmia microphylla spp. occidentalis, Eriophorum chamissonis, Rhynchospora alba, and Gaultheria shallon), Sphagnum mosses, and scrub Pinus contorta var. contorta. About 29% of Burns Bog that was not directly disturbed remains in this condition today, and much of the area that was disturbed by peat extraction activities and drainage appears to be regenerating towards this condition. The major difference from historic conditions is that there were limited forest stands before the 1940s; pine and birch trees have established and spread in areas where the bog is adjacent to drainage ditches.  Another major change has been the loss of lagg (bog margin) plant communities, as a result of conversion of these margin lands to other uses. Despite encouraging signs of regenerating bog vegetation, it may be necessary to adjust our expectations of future water levels and plant community composition because climate change has resulted in lower than normal total precipitation during the moisture deficit season in this region (April-October). The bog has also been reduced in overall size and there are permanent incursions into the bog (e.g. highways, roads, landfills). The primary ecological goal is to restore the bog as close to historic conditions as possible, with the appreciation that the overall area of the bog has been reduced and climate change may result in a somewhat altered ecology and hydrological regime. The main objective is to raise the water table to be similar to typical bog conditions. By raising the water table, bog vegetation will have the opportunity to outcompete non-bog species. Other objectives that will lead towards the ultimate restoration goal include control of invasive species and management of the encroaching forests. The primary socio-economic goal is to educate local citizens on the importance of this wetland in terms of its ecosystem services and its inherent value as a rare ecosystem and habitat for hundreds of bird and animal species.

The primary stakeholders are the purchasing partners: City of Delta, Metro Vancouver, the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, and Environment and Climate Change Canada. Metro Vancouver and the City of Delta manage the bog on a daily basis. Metro Vancouver hosts meetings of the Burns Bog Scientific Advisory Panel, formed in 2005, who advise the land managers on the management of the bog using the best science of the day.
Other stakeholders are the Burns Bog Conservation Society (NGO), farmers who operate in the lands adjacent to the bog, Fortis BC (regional natural gas provider), BC Hydro (regional electricity provider) and the general public. These parties are informed of activities in Burns Bog on an as-needed basis. Metro Vancouver and the City of Delta have hosted a number of public open houses to update local residents on the restoration progress. Both organizations also host websites with updates relating to Burns Bog. Metro Vancouver has produced several educational videos about the management, restoration, and research activities in Burns Bog, and the City of Delta occasionally provides updates on social media. The City of Delta produced an educational guide to Burns Bog for Grade 7 teachers.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: The first threat elimination was the purchase of most of Burns Bog by government in 2004 and designation of those lands as an ecological conservancy area. 

Over 110 km of drainage ditches were installed in Burns Bog during the peat extraction operations (1930s-1980s). These ditches have been progressively blocked by the City of Delta since 2001, although many of the ditches have also been blocked by beavers. To date, over 450 dams have been installed in the ditches, mostly by hand. 

Invasive species are being managed by physical removal and use of herbicides. While it may not be possible to eliminate all invasive species from the 3,000 ha site, efforts are being made to manage the species of greatest concern and to keep other species from spreading.

Tree encroachment as a result of historic drainage is another threat to the bog ecosystem. Tree removal is being considered as a possible additional tool for both hydrological restoration and vegetation management. A tree-removal test plot is being monitored and tree seedlings are being removed from a recently burned site. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: As noted above, the hydrological conditions of the bog interior are being restored by blocking the ditches. 

At the edge of the bog, where the wetland meets drainage ditches of adjacent farms, a different solution will be required to ensure that adjacent farmland is not flooded by bog water. An “underground wall”, which is essentially sheet piling, is being tested in one segment of the bog margin to determine if it is a feasible solution to the edge drainage threat.

Since only 1-2 m of surface peat was removed during the industrial peat extraction operations, a thick (5 m) layer of peat remains throughout most of Burns Bog. This provides the peat substrate and hydrochemical conditions (e.g. low pH) required for bog restoration. As the water table is restored, Sphagnum mosses will establish and restore the surface substrate conditions appropriate to a raised bog, i.e. a porous upper layer of peat known as the acrotelm. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: The ultimate goal of raising the water table is to achieve a desirable species composition, i.e. Sphagnum mosses and an open heath plant community. Invasive species are being managed and tree seedlings are being removed to encourage the spread of native species. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): As the water table rises and Sphagnum and open heath plant communities establish, it is expected that structural diversity typical of a raised bog ecosystem will naturally follow. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Ecosystem functionality is being indirectly restored through the blocking of ditches, raising of the water table, and restoration of characteristic raised bog vegetation. This work has been made possible because of the protection of the bog as an ecological conservancy area. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): As a raised bog, which by definition only receives water from precipitation, Burns Bog is naturally somewhat isolated from the surrounding landscape in terms of hydrology in that it receives essentially no water inputs from the surrounding landscape. Historically, drainage from the bog was radial from the centre outwards and ultimately flowed north to the Fraser River and south to Boundary Bay. The peat extraction activities altered the drainage conditions in the bog so that approximately 70% of the bog’s drainage now leaves the bog from a single outflow point north to the Fraser River. Since farming and industrial uses have overtaken the historic lagg (margin) of the bog, it will not be possible to restore the external hydrological connections to historic conditions. However, a long-term goal of restoring Burns Bog includes establishing a new lagg around the perimeter of the bog within the current protected area boundary; observations in this and other local bogs suggest that this may be possible.

With respect to wildlife movement, Burns Bog is largely surrounded by highways and wildlife fencing. This limits the movement of large mammals (e.g. bear, deer, coyote), although there are some areas where these species are able to access farmland and other natural areas such as the Fraser River and Boundary Bay. Movement of small mammals is restricted but not entirely limited by the perimeter highways. Birds are able to continue moving between other important habitat areas in the region. To date, no efforts have been made to improve wildlife movement from the condition on the date of purchase. Since the date of purchase, additional highways and roads have been constructed at the bog margin, further limiting wildlife movement; one of these projects included a handful of wildlife tunnels, which met with limited success. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: Burns Bog is highly susceptible to wildfire. With nearby operations including a major natural gas pipeline, regionally significant power lines, highways, wood products processing, and industrial facilities using large quantities of chemicals, management of fires in Burns Bog is of extreme socio-economic importance. The managing agencies have prepared a fire management plan for the bog, including operational maps and annual training for fire crews, and there are strict regulations in place to limit activities that are at high-risk for causing fires. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Designating most of Burns Bog as an ecological conservancy area in 2004 protected the lands from being used for agriculture and other purposes that would have resulted in further degradation to the ecosystem. Other parcels of the bog have been designated as conservation lands as well, with more expected to follow in future years. However, some privately-owned parcels in Burns Bog continue to be threatened with conversion to agriculture and industrial operations.

The installation of more than 450 dams in the drainage ditches has largely eliminated the threat of drainage in the bog interior, although the drainage at the margin of the bog has not yet been sufficiently addressed.

Some species (e.g. knotweed) are being successfully managed through herbicide application. Other species (e.g. garlic mustard, reed canarygrass, blackberry) will require further intervention.

A study on the effect of tree removal from 0.3 ha in Burns Bog on the local water table was inconclusive due to the small size of the trees that were removed. It has been observed, however, that desirable bog shrubs are establishing in the clear-cut area. The pine seedlings have not required further management, but birch regrowth was rampant in the clearcut site. The managing agencies are currently investigating methods for managing birch (e.g. cutting, pulling, herbicide injection/spraying). Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: The water table is being raised and stabilized throughout the bog interior as a result of ditch blocking and beaver dams. The success of the underground wall pilot project at the bog margin will not be known for several years. Sphagnum mosses are establishing in many disturbed areas, but large-scale mapping is required to determine how widespread the restoration has been. Current research in Burns Bog using UAVs to map the spectral signatures of different Sphagnum species may allow land managers to answer this question. Achieve a desirable species composition: As the water table has increased and stabilized over the past 17 years of ditch blocking activities, Sphagnum mosses and other desired bog species have begun to reestablish in the peat-extracted fields. Removal of invasive species and trees should allow for further spread of desirable bog vegetation, although these vegetation management activities are more recent and have not yet produced the desired results on a large scale. Reinstate structural diversity: Due to the slow growth of bog vegetation, many of the peat-extracted fields are still in the early stages of recovery. However, observations suggest that these fields, which are currently mostly dominated by Sphagnum mosses and graminoids, will eventually progress to the open heath community that is typical of the undisturbed areas of Burns Bog.

As the water table is raised near the drier bog edges, it is expected that the trees will be replaced by Sphagnum and open heath communities. Some trees have already died off as a result of a higher water table in certain areas. Recover ecosystem functionality: As Sphagnum mosses continue to spread in the peat-extracted fields, it is expected that typical raised bog hydrological functionality will be restored. These are slow processes and it could be decades before we are able to determine that the restoration efforts have been successful. Extensive hydrological observations since 2005 suggest that hydrological functionality is returning to the peat-extracted fields. However, many studies in other restored bogs have shown that complete restoration of hydrological functionality may not occur, or at least not for many decades.

Since 29% of the bog was not directly disturbed by the peat extraction operations, it is believed that many biotic processes (e.g. plant-animal interactions) will be able to recover quickly once the extracted fields have recovered to a more typical bog vegetation. However, the focus to date has been on re-establishing the hydrological processes. Other aspects of the ecosystem have so far received less monitoring and research emphasis. More work is expected in this area in future. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: Since most historic hydrological connections with the surrounding landscape have been irreversibly altered from historic conditions, land managers plan to restore the hydrological, hydrochemical and vegetative conditions of a natural lagg within the current protected area of the bog. Further research is required prior to undertaking this major restoration project. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Climate change appears to be causing longer, drier, hotter summers in the region in which Burns Bog is located. Not only are wildfires increasingly prevalent in the region, but reduced precipitation has resulted in a lower summer water table in the bog in recent years. While unable to significantly impact global climate change processes, local land managers are hoping to buffer Burns Bog from these effects by raising the water table and promoting resilient bog plant communities.

The sheer size of Burns Bog is another factor limiting its recovery. As invasive species and trees continue to spread in the areas of the bog most affected by disturbance and drainage, the limited resources available to the land managers may not be enough to encourage bog species to recover in these areas.  It is hoped that raising the water table will allow many bog processes to reestablish on their own, but it is recognized that further resources may be required.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Hydrological restoration and vegetation management activities have created employment opportunities for several contractors. Funding has also been made available by the land managers and external agencies for several graduate student research projects.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: Restoration of Burns Bog does not provide basic necessities to humans. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: One area of Burns Bog, the Delta Nature Reserve, is open to the public for recreation. There are gravel trails and boardwalks in the area that are popular for cycling, dog walking, running, walking, and bird-watching. The Burns Bog Conservation Society hosts an annual pilgrimage to raise awareness about Burns Bog; they also host nature day camps for children and a fun run to support their charity. None of the restoration activities have directly contributed to these benefits; however, ensuring the long-term survival of the bog through restoration indirectly supports these cultural dimensions. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: One major benefit of restoring Burns Bog is that intact bogs are excellent carbon sinks. Based on research by the University of British Columbia, Burns Bog is currently a carbon sink and a methane source. It is believed that, once the peat-harvested fields recover fully and change from their current state (Sphagnum and graminoids) to the desired state (Sphagnum and open heath), there will be less methane production and the bog will once again act as a carbon sink. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: To our knowledge, there have been no negative consequences of the restoration activities. Management of undesirable birch trees in bogs is challenging because, once established, birch is tolerant of a high and fluctuating water table and has the ability to coppice when cut at the base. Pulling out small seedlings and the use of herbicide on larger trees are the management techniques being used in Burns Bog at this time. However, the long-term success rate of these techniques is not yet known.
Ditch blockages generally only raise the water table within about 15-30 m of the ditch. Depending on the historic effects of the ditch (e.g. drainage, tree encroachment, peat subsidence), it may not be possible to fully counteract the past effects of the ditch by blocking it. Other restoration actions, e.g. active vegetation management, may be required. A long-term monitoring program was established in 2005, shortly after the purchase of Burns Bog and designation of the lands as an ecological conservancy area. The City of Delta monitors a network of water level stations across the bog on a monthly basis, while Metro Vancouver monitors dozens of permanent vegetation plots annually. The monitoring data provide these managing agencies with the information needed to focus restoration efforts (e.g. ditch blocking) on the areas requiring the greatest intervention. Restoration activities are expected to continue until the ecosystem has been determined to be stable and recovering on its own.
The Burns Bog Scientific Advisory Panel has been meeting with the managing partners since 2005, and will continue to advise the management team into the foreseeable future. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/healthy-forest-healthy-wildlife-the-wilds-cumberland-ohio/	Healthy Forest, Healthy Wildlife: The Wilds, Cumberland, Ohio	United States of America	2017-02	2020	"The Wilds is a non-profit center dedicated to environmental conservation through science, education, and visitor personal experience. While The Wilds is most well-known for its exotic animals, most of The Wilds’ land is actually devoted to native conservation and restoration after agriculture and surface mining for coal in the late 20th century removed most of the region’s forests. Sections mined before 1976 tended to be reclaimed as forest and often have poorly developed soils with understories dominated by non-native species. The goal of this project was to try to restore the understories of these reclaimed forests. Between 2017 and early 2019, restoration efforts in our “Healthy Forest, Healthy Wildlife” area included invasive species removal, native plantings, and constructing animal shelters. All steps to restore this ecosystem involve local school groups as volunteers. This allows us to foster close relationships with high school students and teachers, teaching conservation through hands on experience conducting forest restoration. Building student’s skills will benefit the community, motivating locals to be engaged in conservation and ecology. This project will also benefit our wildlife; higher quality forests may increase wildlife presence. This project will serve as a pilot demonstration to improve reclaimed forest habitat for wildlife.Agriculture & Livestock, Climate Change, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Mining & Resource Extraction As a legacy mining site, ecosystems at The Wilds tend to be low diversity, low quality habitat. Compact, nutrient poor soil and invasive species are two of the main causes of these unhealthy ecosystems. Forest planted during reclamation tends to be low species diversity, with little to no topsoil or compact topsoil. The invasive species autumn olive (Elaegnus umbellata) was planted during reclamation, and other invasive species such as Tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissimata) and Multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora) have invaded the forests. Due to severe soil disturbance during mining, likely no seed bank remained from pre-mining times, and few if any understory species typical of deciduous hardwood forests can be found. Additionally, high deer browse limits tree seedling survival.
Climate change predictions for the area predict increases in heavy rainfall events with longer stretches of drought. Due to low amounts of organic matter, soils at The Wilds tend to have low water holding capacity and will thus be unable to hold water from heavy rainfall events and dry out quickly between rains. In addition, the low diversity of the plants in the ecosystem reduces resiliency. Should any individual species be negatively impacted by climate, the entire ecosystem could suffer declines in food and habitat resources for wildlife. Forests at The Wilds are vulnerable to changes in climate predicted for the area. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).The land at The Wilds before European settlement was deciduous hardwood forest, but most (over 95%) of the forest in the area was removed for agriculture or mining. In the Healthy Forest, Healthy Wildlife (HFHW) area, the land was likely not planted into trees but left to regenerate naturally, and though a forest has grown, it is low quality, low diversity, and plagued by invasive species. The land has since been recovering from the disturbance associated with surface mining for more than two decades, but it remains extremely altered from its original state and has associated environmental problems. Loss of the native seed bank and microflora, severe soil compaction, low nutrients, and presence of invasive species all must be contended with while attempting restoration. There are restrictions as to what can actually be achieved and it is extremely difficult to target historical references. It therefore becomes necessary to set ecosystem functional goals that can be achieved in a shorter time frame.
The target goal for “Healthy Forest, Healthy Wildlife” is the reconstruction of a diverse understory plant community and the return of the original ecosystem function in terms of wildlife habitat and carbon sequestration. We have been conducting surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of our restoration activities for the improvement of this ecosystem. So far we have increased species richness and diversity in areas cleared and planted with native species, and reduced invasive species cover in all cleared areas. To test whether our improvements were effective, we monitor tree survival, understory vegetation, amphibian populations, and mammal presence- especially bobcats and coyotes. We monitor the response of wildlife populations at the site using stationary field camera traps, bird point counts, and cover boards for amphibians. We hope to simultaneously improve the health of our forest and increase native wildflower and wildlife diversity and abundances. The Wilds Department of Restoration Ecology works to restore land on Wilds property that has been disturbed from surface mining. Healthy Forest, Healthy Wildlife is an experiment designed to improve the health of our reclaimed forest while discovering the best restoration methods to use on disturbed land. Additionally, The Wilds has over 100,000 visitors a year. The forest improvement location is along The Wilds tour bus route, giving a perfect opportunity for general public education.
To address the low diversity forest habitat and improve the health of our forests, we are implementing a threefold approach, which has currently been applied to 14 acres and has funding to expand across another 9 acres.
1) Remove invasive species
2) Plant a high diversity mix of native species:
a. In the understory of the existing forest
b. Adjacent to the existing forest, expanding the forest patch.
3) Create Wildlife habitat:
a. Establish vernal pools
b. Create brush piles
c. Install bat habitat structures
The original 10 acres which were part of this project have been set up as an experiment, with invasive removal only from 5 acres, invasive removal + native planting in 5 acres. We are monitoring these two areas as well as a control where no invasive removal has occurred to evaluate a) the value added by planting over invasive removal only as compared with no control and b) the ability of the planted species to survive in the compact soil conditions.
This project is intended to be a demonstration site to showcase the benefits of these restoration methods on reclaimed forests. Information from this project will be shared with reclaimed mine sites across the Appalachian region through the Appalachian Regional Reforestation Initiative.
Another goal of the project is to empower locals- especially students to become involved in conservation. Whenever possible, we bring out schools or other local volunteer groups to be involved with invasive removal and native planting efforts. This allows learning through hands on conservation and inspires future interest in restoration.

Monitoring Details: We have been conducting surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of our restoration activities for the improvement of this ecosystem. To test whether our improvements were effective, we monitor tree survival, understory vegetation, amphibian populations, and mammal presence- especially bobcats and coyotes. We monitor the response of wildlife populations at the site using stationary field camera traps, bird point counts, and cover boards for amphibians. Start date, including baseline data collection: 2017 End Date: 2020+

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: The main threat to the ecosystem is invasive species.
Through our “Adopt a Plot” program, we motivate school groups to assist with invasive species removal while learning about restoration issues and the importance of invasive species control. Invasive plant species are removed by the groups with hand tools.  Afterwards, a staff member certified in herbicide application treats stumps with herbicide to avoid regrowth. The primary target is the invasive shrub autumn olive, but other targets include multiflora rose and garlic mustard. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: We have established a vernal pool in the area of Healthy forest, Healthy Wildlife. We are unable to directly address the soil deficiencies, but hope through time the species planted will add organic matter and nutrients to the soil, as well as alleviating compaction. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: After invasive species removal, we planted a diverse mix of 288 woody shrubs (48 per plot), 564 herbaceous plants (94 per plot), and 348 trees (58 per plot), in addition to spreading herbaceous plant seed at a rate of about 46 seeds per square foot.

Trees-Likely due to high deer browse pressure, there are few seedlings in the understory of the HFHW area, and the vast majority of those are one species, box elder. There are also a number of canopy gaps which had been filled in primarily by autumn olive or other invasives.  In order to promote a more diverse overstory and fill in some of these gaps, we planted 360 canopy tree seedlings with the following species:  red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Quercus alba), black oak (Quercus velutina), persimmon (Diospyros vigriniana), and tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera). Each tree planted was protected from herbivory with a 2’ high tube.

Expansion of forest habitat:
In order to expand the forest, we also planted 5 acres adjacent to existing forest with 5 different species of tree seedlings, using the same tree species as for the understory planting.  Further details on this project are available on request; please email us for more information.

Woody Shrubs- We wanted to make sure to plant species which would have suitable habitat in the future taking climate change into consideration, so we would establish a diverse and resilient ecosystem. In order to determine which woody understory species would have future suitable habitat at our site, we used maximum entropy modeling to test the success of various woody plant species to be planted in the Healthy Forest, Healthy Wildlife study area. Data was modeled in MaxEnt to predict the distribution of species in best and worst case climate scenarios in 50 and 70 years (See attached distribution model figures). In the face of climate change, the species with the most survival success into the future were chosen and planted in our study area.   These species included redbud (Cercis canadensis), black haw (Viburnum prunifolium), arrowwood viburnum (Viburnum dentatum), and gray dogwood (Cornus racemose).  Species with poor distribution predictions not chosen to be planted in this area included serviceberry genus (Amelanchier spp ), pagoda dogwood (Cornus alternifolia), spicebush (Lindera benzoin), and nannyberry (Viburnum lentago ). All woody shrubs planted were protected with a 2’ high tube to prevent herbivory.

Herbaceous plants- Both seeds and plugs were planted. Seeds (about 46 seeds per square foot) were manually sown into this area in the winter time after invasive removal was complete in an area. Different seed mixes were used in different areas (shade, sun, wetland mixes). Shade mixes included species such as virginia wild rye (Elymus virginicus), tall bellflower (Campanulastrum americanum), and lavender hyssop (Agastache foeniculum). Wetland mixes included species such as riverbank wild rye (Elymus riparius), Wingstem (Verbesina alternifolia), and wild bergamot (Monarda fistulosa). Lastly, sun mixes included species such as black eyed susan (Rudbeckia hirta), purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea), and tall gray coneflower (Ratibida pinnata).  Five different species were planted as plugs including joepye weed (Eupatorium purpureum), jack in the pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum), wild blue phlox (Phlox divaricate), wild columbine (Aquilegia Canadensis), and false solomon's seal (Maianthemum racemosum). 

In general, we attempted to provide a diverse mix of native species, which may increase food resources for wildlife, nectar resources for pollinators, and prevent invasive species from repopulating. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Removal of invasive species has returned the forest understory to its open natural structure.  We have piled the cut stems into brush piles to add structural diversity for nesting mammals, provide dead woody stems for nesting bees, and eventually provide coarse woody debris for salamander structures.  We have also installed 10 Brandenbark bat roosting poles, which provide the structural nesting habitat required for bats which is typically absent in younger forests. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): By increasing the number of species in this area, we hope to increase the resiliency of this ecosystem to threats such as disease or climate change. Diverse communities of organisms are an important part of ecosystem resilience because varying members of functional groups (predators, prey, or decomposers) respond to uncertainty in different ways. The higher the species richness in a particular landscape, the more likely there will be differences in environmental sensitivity among species that are functionally similar. Additionally, by providing a diverse understory, floral resources will be available over a longer period of time than in systems dominated by a monoculture which blooms only in one time period.  Thus, a diverse ecosystem is likely to support a more diverse and resilient pollinator population. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): This project will benefit wildlife; higher quality habitat in our forests may increase wildlife presence, in particular bobcats, amphibians, and upland forest birds. Higher quality habitat will assist with migrations by providing better food resources. 
Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: 1.Low soil quality, including low diversity microbial communities, low nutrients, and compact soil prevents growth of trees and other flora. 
2. High amounts of invasive species seeds in the seed bank and adjacent areas are likely to promote invasives returning after removal.  
3.A potential lack of native seed bank due to mining will limit natural recovery: seeds must be manually sown.
4.High browse pressure by deer on any planted species.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: By keeping to our mission to “Lead and Inspire by Connecting People and Wildlife” we hope to raise people’s awareness of the environmental issues we are faced with today. Most notably, that one does not have to travel to Africa or Antarctica to find evidence of diminishing habitat and wildlife populations. By bringing people closer to environmental problems in their own backyard, we hope to foster a local community of people who care about and want to improve our environment together.

According to US Census data, Muskingum County has 9.1% of residents with a bachelor’s degree, much lower than the national average of 18.3%. Only 14.6% have a bachelor’s degree or higher, as compared with 29.3% nationally. 19.2% of people in the county are considered to be in poverty- this is higher than the national average of 15.6%. Therefore, the community has a need for programs to help students boost their resumes with activities that can help them get into college, as well as activities providing them with skills useful in the job market.  This program provides both, engaging students in hands on conservation activities and inspiring them to pursue college degrees in the conservation field.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: A healthier forest with fewer invasive understory species is likely to provide higher quality timber. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: The forest improvement location is along The Wilds tour bus route, giving a perfect opportunity for general public education.  Tour bus drivers share information about the project and its funders with visitors to The Wilds. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: By planting native tree and shrub species we hope to reduce erosion in this area, as well as sequester carbon and help to mitigate the impact of climate change. Additionally, the area is impacted by the emerald ash borer, which has caused death of a number of ash trees.  High deer pressure and low soil quality has caused a lack of regeneration of tree seedlings, without these planting efforts it is likely that the forest would degrade further. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: Not thus far This project was, in part, an experiment set up to determine the best approach to restoring forest on reclaimed mine land. Of the 10 acres that were initially cleared, only 5 were planted. Surveying and comparing vegetation communities in planted and unplanted areas showed that planting had a more positive effect on species richness and diversity. Additional monitoring of almost every tree and shrub planted showed that survival rates thus far (one growing season after planting) are high enough to consider planting a good use of resources. Planting of herbaceous plant plugs by volunteers in difficult to dig soil with high deer pressure is not likely to have a high success rate. The success rate of the seed mixes is yet unknown. This is incredibly valuable information that we will use to inform other mine land managers who are trying to restore their land. We plan to continue invasive species removal, vegetation and amphibian surveys, and monitoring beyond the initial project. Controlling invasive species and preventing repopulation will be an important step in maintaining the long term health of the forest. Continuing to monitor the area and determine the effects of our restoration on wildlife will guide our future management techniques. We also plan to continue the Adopt-a-plot program and keep students involved and interested in environmental issues; we hope this will help improve college acceptance rates for students involved in the program, and empower local students to become involved in conservation. We have an Americorps program with an Americorps VISTA whose focus is engaging students, both individually and in groups, into our HFHW project. Long-term maintenance and continued invasive removal is planned through school groups which have become annual visitors to our site. We plan to pursue more grant funding to expand this site. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-new-jersey-mount-rose-preserve-forest-restoration-project/	USA: New Jersey: Mount Rose Preserve Forest Restoration Project	United States of America	2016-10	2022-10	"The Mount Rose Preserve Forest Restoration Project is sited within an area of the Mount Rose Preserve in Hopewell, NJ, comprised of forests over a hundred years old but with a very limited forest understory due to deer overbrowse. The primary restoration goal is to re-establish a diverse, structurally complex understory such as found within the target reference ecosystem. A secondary goal is to innovate and communicate locally appropriate forest restoration practices. Additional goals include the natural recovery of existing plant species through the exclusion of white tailed deer and successful augmentation with native plant materials. Monitoring is prioritized, and goals are tied to the re-establishment of floristic quality appropriate to the site’s status as a mature forest.The Mount Rose Preserve is a 397-acre preserve in the Piedmont province of central New Jersey, comprised of forest, shrubland, and meadow habitats. This Project is a component of the overall stewardship plan for the preserve, developed by the Friends of Hopewell Valley Open Space.Project objectives for 2016-2017 included: baseline monitoring, selection of a site for 5-acre experimental deer fence, installation of deer fence, inventory of fenced and control botanical survey plots, selection of planting locations, and delivery and planting of native plant materials.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Other Historic land use impacts (grazing), and the impact of overbrowse by white-tailed deer have contributed to a depauperate understory lacking in native herbaceous plants and tree regeneration. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on contemporary reference sites or existing analogues of the pre-degradation ecosystem.The restoration area is characterized three distinct forest types. The area is predominantly dry oak woodland in shallow soils over Passaic formation red shale bedrock and regolith. A smaller portion is comprised of wetlands dominated by pin oak, and an even smaller portion is a mesic lowland forest characterized by beech.
I used the open oak woodland community at St. Michaels Preserve (approximately two miles away) as the primary reference site for the dry oak woodland at Mount Rose Preserve. I conducted botanical surveys at the St. Michaels Preserve in 2010. Other nearby areas of open oak and hickory woodlands included those at Mercer County Park, and small fragments in the Sourland Mountains. Farther afield, areas of open dry glades at Pyramid Mountain and other sites in the New Jersey Highlands were considered. These are in a separate geological province, but geographically fairly close to the site. These latter sites were chosen because they inform some of the structural aspects of understory for the project; they have less severe deer browse impacts. The nearby sites suffer from similar levels of deer browse and are usually somewhat deficient in structure and species density. Together, these sites comprise the reference ecosystem.
Monitoring using floristic quality assessment and a plot-based methodology determined that all plots within the deer exclosure meet an FQA (floristic quality assessment) threshold for “Moderate Quality Natural Area”. Our restoration objective is for the majority of those plots to indicate a “High Quality Natural Area” by 2022. We use this metric, rather than percent cover of different understory strata, because we feel it allows for site heterogeneity and emphasizes quality rather than a rigid quantitative measure. Our goal is to restore this to a High Quality area as ranked by floristic quality assessment, as suggested by the maturity of the forest and the quality of the tree canopy. This will depend on diversification of the herbaceous and woody understory layers. Socio-economic goals are to model the practice of forest understory restoration for the region. Our long-term target for the restoration site is full recovery (as defined in the SER International Standards, p. 9).

Monitoring Details: Ten randomly placed plots inside the deer exclusion fence, and five control plots outside the fence were surveyed May 15 2017. Each plot is 100m2 and circular in shape. See attached map for plot locations. Plots to be resurveyed at interval (three or five years) hence. Plots were permanently marked with rebar painted orange, and are recorded in Friends of Hopewell Valley Open Space' GIS. Survey results were calculated using Floristic Quality Assessment. Start date, including baseline data collection: May 15 2017 End Date: May 15 2022
The Mount Rose Forest Restoration Project is a component of the overall stewardship plan for the preserve written and administered by the Friends of Hopewell Valley Open Space (FoHVOS). The plan is based on stakeholder interviews (in keeping with “early, genuine and active engagement with all stakeholders” SER International Standards p. 23) as well as baseline field investigation and GIS analysis. Primary restoration targets of the plan are forest, shrubland, and meadow habitats requiring a cessation of threats including overbrowse by white-tailed deer and the proliferation of invasive plant species. The establishment of appropriate recreational trails is also a significant priority related to stakeholder engagement and long-term viability of the preserve in the community.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Deer fencing, invasive species removal How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: none How this project achieved a desirable species composition: We chose forty-four native species to augment the depauperate native understory in the restoration site. We propagated these species in our nursery. Each species originated  from genetically diverse seed we collected in New Jersey, in keeping with current guidelines for appropriate restoration plant materials. 

We delivered over 1,000 plants for Spring 2017 and the remaining 1,010 plants will be delivered Fall 2017. The species include: Actaea racemosa, Allium tricoccum, Amelanchier arborea, Aralia racemosa, Arisaema triphyllum, Bromus pubescens, Carex argyrantha, Carex swanii, Carpinus caroliniana, Collinsonia canadensis, Corylus americana, Cunila origanoides, Elymus hystrix, Euonymus americanus, Eupatorium perfoliatum, Eurybia divaricata, Eurybia macrophylla, Eutrochium purpureum, Fragaria virginiana, Geranium maculatum, Hamamelis virginiana, Helianthus divaricatus, Helianthus strumosus, Heuchera americana, Hydrophyllum virginianum, Iris versicolor, Krigia biflora, Laportea canadensis, Lilium superbum, Lindera benzoin, Lobelia cardinalis, Lobelia siphilitica, Maianthemum racemosum, Packera aurea, Polygonatum pubescens, Pycnanthemum incanum, Rosa virginiana, Sambucus canadensis, Scutellaria lateriflora, Solidago caesia, Symphyotrichum cordifolium, Symphyotrichum patens, Thalictrum thalictroides,  and Viburnum acerifolium. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Both deer fencing and augmentation plantings will increase diversity in the understory strata and support a variety of fauna, from pollinators to bird and small mammal species How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): See plantings, above Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: The socio-economic aspects are part of the larger preserve scope and administered by Friends of Hopewell Valley Open Space. They primarily involve stakeholder input, and a nearby bicycle trail. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: FoHVOS land stewards have been removing woody invasive species from the project area. I don't have current data on the extent and effectiveness of their work. Achieve a desirable species composition: Survivorship among planted species has been excellent, and existing native species are beginning to respond to deer exclusion. Follow-up monitoring with quantitative data has not yet been done. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Existing native understory plants have responded to deer exclusion positively, according to visual observations. Follow-up monitoring with quantitative data has not yet been done.
The property is preserved and is managed by the Friends of Hopewell Valley Open Space, a group with a strong commitment to land stewardship "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/edrr-management-of-japanese-knotweed-following-extreme-flooding-vermont-usa/	USA: Vermont: EDRR Management of Japanese knotweed following extreme flooding	United States of America	2012-04	2013-12	"In response to the floods following tropical storm Irene, and the potential for a significant increase in the Japanese knotweed popuation, the state of Vermont hired a coordinator to develop and carry out an early detection & rapid response (EDRR) work plan to eliminate as many of these new plants as possible, using only manual labor. Removal work was carried out eleven to thirteen months after Irene, along four river systems. During removal work, morphological data was collected from plants to help develop and refine the EDRR protocols that had been used. Our goal was to determine what each new shoot could tell us about the rest of the new plant, and develop management strategies based on the results. We found that the size of the emergent shoot is not related to the extent of underground growth, though it is related to the size of the propagule. We also found that 70% of new plants originated from rhizome fragments, and 30% were from stems. This proportion is similar to regeneration rates shown in laboratory studies conducted over much shorter time frames, suggesting that regenerative abilities are longer lasting than previously documented. Our findings suggest that the best way to prevent the spread of knotweed along rivers is to focus control efforts on those stands most susceptible to erosion. Additionally, our work provides evidence that by applying an early detection & rapid response framework to knotweed control, the spread of knotweed can be effectively controlled without the use of herbicides or heavy tools.Climate Change, Fire & Weather Events, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) The degradation was a direct result of extreme flooding, which washed out many stands of Japanese knotweed on the banks of rivers. The fragmented stems and rhizomes were distributed throughout downstream floodplains. As this was an early detection and rapid response (EDRR) project, no degradation was observed. On rivers which experienced similar localized events several years past, the elimination of the riparian forest could be observed in various stages. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on contemporary reference sites or existing analogues of the pre-degradation ecosystem.As an EDRR project, the reference ecosystem was the same as the ecosystem we were working in. Demonstrating the ability to control the spread of Japanese knotweed without the use of chemicals, to be successful within an EDRR framework, and to demonstrate that such actions can lead to the long-term eradication of new populations.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Stakeholders were primarily the communities through which these rivers ran, and the private landowners along the stream banks. Education and outreach was conducted primarily in partnership with the town government’s volunteer conservation commissions, which hosted and advertised workshops and workdays.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: This was an effort focused on a single target species, at a very specific stage of development. The threat to the ecosystem posed by the development of new stands of knotweed was eliminated, but no other threats addressed, including those posed by existing knotweed stands. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: We prevented the loss of appropriate physical conditions, rather than reinstating any. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Our actions ensured that the current species composition was not further degraded/impacted How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Our actions ensured that the current structural diversity was not further degraded/impacted How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Our actions ensured that the current ecosystem functionality was not further degraded/impacted How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Our actions ensured that the current external exchanges with the surrounding landscape was not further degraded/impacted Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: NA

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: NA
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: NA Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: NA Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: Circumstantial evidence suggests that Japanese knotweed contributes to erosion, and that erosion during flooding may be a primary driver of the spread of this species. In the case that this hypothesis proves true, the elimination of knotweed plants should decrease streambank erosion. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: No. EDRR of Japanese knotweed is a viable management strategy with excellent chances for long-term success
70% of new Japanese knotweed propagules dispersed by flooding originate from rhizomes
The window for EDRR management of flood dispersed Japanese knotweed propagules is 18-20 months; or through the whole of the first growing season following flooding, and into the beginning of the second spring Sites were inspected at the end of the first growing season, and new plants that sprouted after initial management had taken place were removed. Site visits the following spring found no plants had been missed, or sprouted after the initial follow-up inspection. No long-term management plans were required. In subsequent floods, landowners are now in possession of the knowledge needed to successfully remove any new knotweeds in left behind by those future floods. "

3. Ensure the sustainability of the Project by empowering local communities and demonstrating how they can benefit from restoration interventions; and
4. Improve the efficiency of restoration by identifying interventions that maximize impact of and minimize costs in different contexts

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The local communities are the privileged partners of MNP for all its activities. 1092 people, some fifty of whom are women, participate in conservation activities, including restoration, at the level of the project area. They are structured into Local Park Committees) since 2013 in the framework of co-management established for the network of protected areas managed by MNP. The governance model used by MNP in the project’s 3 National Parks complies with the governance principles of the Madagascar System of Protected Areas, as defined in the law recasting the Code of Protected Areas. Therefore the neighboring communities will be the main partners in the realization of this project.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Carry out pilot natural regeneration interventions through exclosure of the sites intended for this purpose and other actions, as recommended by the preliminary study How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Conduct a study to identify priority areas of natural habitat to be restored and the most appropriate restoration interventions How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Training of local communities for their participation in defined restoration interventions In terms of monitoring, at the end of the project, the restored plots will be integrated into the ecological monitoring system and will be monitored annually by MNP. Each year, a report on the state of conservation of the property is sent to UNSECO / CPM, which includes monitoring the restoration of degraded areas through cuts, clearing and illegal mining including the 3 project sites.

They will build two plant nurseries to be managed by the local community; and together with nearby universities they will develop robust capacity building and academic training programs based on the knowledge collected and developed during this project.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation 1) The implementation of restoration models and strategies for the recovery and connectivity of degraded and deforested areas; and
2) The strenghtening of knowledge and capacity of farmers from San Juan and Lejia directly involved in the implementation of restoration models and development of strategies to ensure ecosystem benefits in their localities.
Local communities, farmers local authorities and park rangers are involved in every step of the project, from identifying areas to be restored to attending field training on restoration principles and practice, and related economic activities.
Since 2005, CIMA has been working with these communities through participatory planning meetings in which they have identified areas for restoration, which is why these activities will be easily integrated into the conservation agreements (Acuerdos Azules or ‘Blue Agreements’) of collaboration between CIMA and the communities; these activities are part of the priorities they have identified on their quality of life plans.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Along with the villagers of San Juan and Lejía, the CIMA technical team identified as degraded areas in their territories the following biotopes: purmas with abandoned coffee plantations, shapumbales, and secondary forests where there was selective logging of timber trees. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Build, implement, produce and maintain a nursery in each community to produce seedlings. These will be selected once the reference-plot assessment is completed. Total production should reach an estimated 15,000 seedlings over the two sites. Two main nurseries will be promoted by the Project, but groups of farmers (women) will be encouraged to have smaller, local nurseries. Seedlings will also be collected from the field and grown in communal nurseries until final establishment in the field. 
The project decided to decentralize the reproduction of plants, installing local nurseries near the restoration teams and the areas to be recovered, in order to facilitate the reintroduction stage of the various species and maximise time, effort, and survival rate of seedlings in the transfer. As of now there are eight (08) nurseries, in which 23 climax and 2 intermediate species have been reproduced. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): From the field schools, it was defined that the restoration technique to be implemented was that of nucleation. Nucleation allows the formation of micro-habitats, improving environmental conditions and attracting series of other organisms, forming nuclei of diversity. In the secondary forests and purmas the enrichment technique will be used with the sowing of functional groups with strong nucleating power. In the shapumbales, regeneration islands were opened, perches were placed, soil transposed and pioneer species reintroduced, creating new niches of regeneration / colonization. The identified areas total 65.32 hectares

Along with Lejía villagers, the rangers of the Cordillera Azul National Park and the professors and students of the National Agrarian University of La Selva (UNAS), CIMA established the first permanent plot of vegetation monitoring in the montane forest conservation area of the town of Lejía; in order to establish a reference scenario. This ecosystem provided information on the composition, horizontal and vertical structure of the forest, with the species to be used for reintroduction based on the results obtained. Thus, the project has selected 25 climax plant species that will be reproduced and reintroduced in the degraded ecosystems identified in the towns of Lejía and San Juan. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: i) Identification of areas to be restored with the communities, arrangement with owners and conclusion of long-term commitments for restoration within the conservation agreements (Acuerdos Azules) between the communities and CIMA.
ii) Partner with academic institutions to develop field training schools; CIMA will establish an agreement with the Universidad Nacional Agraria de la Selva (UNAS) and will contribute with structuring field training with farmers and material production. Students will also participate and learn restoration principles and practice. 
iii) Strengthen technical and organizational capacities of stakeholder groups; CIMA will help in organizing restoration activities and training farmer groups to implement field activities, and related economic activities (institutional accountability, strenghthening rules and functions, management). CIMA will also work with other groups (local authorities, park rangers) in identifying with them roles and functions for restoration.
iv) Convert lessons learned from the Project into teaching modules to be adopted in academic curricula and/or continuing education programs. 
Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Mid-project report: The process of capacity building in future restorers is carried out through field schools, spaces of learning and practical knowledge application, which are part of the Extension Plan of the Forest Engineering School of the UNAS. So far, seven schools have been carried out, providing capacity-building to 43 students: 19 residents of San Juan and Lejía, 2 officials of the local government of Shamboyacu, 1 specialist of the ARA San Martín, 4 professors and 4 students of the UNAS, 3 PNCAZ park rangers and 10 CIMA technicians.
From the field activities carried out during the field schools, we identified propagative material for regeneration and selected 13 intermediate species and 24 dynamogenetic pioneers in the local environment of both locations. These pioneer species are characterized by high production of seeds, contribution of organic matter and production of many fruits.
The process of participatory long-term monitoring is assured, since CIMA will remain in the area until 2028 due to the contract it has with the Peruvian State to administer the Cordillera Azul National Park, which involves the CIMA technical team and park rangers in the intervention area.
In the long term, the project hopes to create the necessary partnerships and modules for a scalable restoration system, replicable at least in the Department of San Martin, and significantly contribute to reducing deforestation in this region. "

Plants for Life International is aiming to create a unique example of a model indigenous forest for the region with increased plant biodiversity.
The project will support replanting of new areas of forest with native trees, clearing of invasive species, and expansion onto nearby public and private land. Collection trips to remote locations will be conducted to obtain new species, specimens and propagative material from protected & unprotected degraded areas. To address the lack of botanical knowledge, training courses will be held for national and regional trainees, aimed at NGO and governmental workers that are involved in native tree planting reforestation. Finally, the project will demonstrate to local communities in and around the project site that substantial economic and social benefits can be derived from mature, diverse forests of indigenous species, without compromising their ecological integrity.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Environmental degradation has been rampant in the county whereby there is massive felling of trees in forests like Kinare forest, leading to high risk of soil erosion and desertification.
This has been brought about by increased population pressure and fuel demand by most industries. The development of industries coupled with population pressure has significantly increased the pollution levels including air pollution that the existing facilities are unable to handle. Pollution especially from industries for example: tea factories and coffee industries are real danger to the environment because of disposing effluents into air and the rivers in the county. The poor farming methods, pesticides and chemicals used in agricultural activities have also led to pollution of rivers and the environment. Other environment issues of concern in the county include; the mushrooming of slums and destruction of water catchments areas particularly because of farming on hillsides and on marginal areas The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).1) Continued restoration of a unique example of a created and model indigenous forest for the sub-afromontane region of Kenya with increased plant biodiversity, ensuring in situ and ex situ conservation of national and regional taxa threatened in their range;
2) A major drive for the eradication of invasive plant species which are the greatest threat to satisfactory forest restoration;
3) Expansion of the project onto nearby land (2 ha. of Government land and one ha. of private land on a tea plantation) based on existing agreements with local government authorities and tea plantation owners;
4) Addressing the lack of botanical knowledge by NGO and state actors in the planning and implementation of restoration projects in Kenya and in the region, which is a major constraint to successful restoration;
5) Demonstration to local communities in and around the project site that substantial economic and social benefits can be derived from mature, diverse forests of indigenous species, without compromising their ecological integrity.
The local community is involved in four ways:
1. Local employment: all PLI staff, apart from the Director are local
2. PLI allow locals to come and harvest indigenous vegetables and medicine from the forest
3. Locals (farmers and schoolchildren) are encouraged to come for nature walks and environmental training
4. Small-scale tree planting on schools and community plots (including churches and institutions)

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Control of invasive species in existing forest e.g. Cestrum aurantiacum, Acacia mearnsii, Solanum mauritianum and Eucalyptus regrowth, including on newly restored areas How this project achieved a desirable species composition: i) Replanting new areas of forest with native trees on areas cleared of invasive species
ii) Five collection trips to remote locations to obtain new species, specimens and propagative material from protected & unprotected degraded areas such as Kakamega Forest, Mt. Kenya/ Aberdares, Taita Hills, Shimba Hills and Ukambani Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: i) Two, one week-long training courses for national and regional trainees, aimed at NGO & government/parastatal workers that are involved in native tree planting and reforestation as well as for participants from NGOs in Uganda and Tanzania
ii) Demonstration to local communities in and around the project site that substantial economic and social benefits can be derived from mature, diverse forests of indigenous species, without compromising their ecological integrity 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Large areas of invasive plants have been removed from the native forest. This is an ongoing process which has required the hiring of three teams of casual workers in the forest. This work is ongoing and challenging: the larger the area planted, the larger area under threat from invasives. Ideally, a larger team of casuals is required. Control of invasives is likely to be continued for the life of the project (2030). Achieve a desirable species composition: 1000 trees have been planted on private land on a nearby tea farm. 1000 trees have been planted on government land. 4300 trees have been planted on Brackenhurst forest. Survivability is approx 95 % owing to exclusion of livestock. In addition 5000 trees were supplied (plus 12 specimens of rare species) to Friends of Karura forest, the protected forest within Nairobi. 400 trees were donated to Limuru Primary school plus 200 trees A.I.C. Ndeyia. All trees propagated in the tree nuresery are indigenous. 29 species are regarded as rare, endangered or vulnerable.
2 trips to remote locations have been made to collect Eastern Arc endemics species listed on IUCN Red List as rare, vulnerable and endangered.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Mid-project report: Coffee training on site with external consultant; Bee-keeping consultancy for 10 new hives. PLI provided consulting services to Africa Wildlife Foundation (training and planting of indigenous trees).
PLI aspires to make this project the best model forest restoration site in East Africa. PLI has 13 years before achievement of a mature tropical forest with high plant and faunal diversity and >90 percent canopy cover over 40 ha. The project was awarded Level 3 accreditation with ArbNet in 2017(Morton Arboretum, Chicago). "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/identifying-biodiversity-related-success-factors-of-ecological-restoration-projects/	Lebanon: Identifying biodiversity-related success factors of ecological restoration projects	Lebanon	2017-05	2019-07	"The project focuses on determining biodiversity-related success factors of ecological restoration projects in a biodiversity hotspot of Lebanon, Mount Lebanon.  It will consider the role of wildlife in ecological restoration processes, by studying what different animals disperse, in relation to different plant species over different time frames.  Diverse plants that can sustain wildlife year round will be identified to promote the sustainability of the restored ecosystem and its natural regeneration. Given its novel character in associating different concerned biodiversity partners, this study hopes to inspire subsequent reforestation actions in Lebanon and in the Eastern Mediterranean region.Deforestation, Fragmentation Today Lebanon‘s natural resources are rapidly becoming depleted. Problems of land degradation and deforestation do not date from the last few decades, but began more than a century ago and are still continuing. It is a long historical process of cutting down trees and not allowing regeneration, over-exploitation of wood, fires, overgrazing etc. These highly unsustainable processes have finally led to a high degree of erosion and to a loss of productivity of the land.
Since the early sixties, Lebanon experienced many reforestation projects. But these efforts were hampered by the war which lasted for more than 30 years and would have had anyway limited impact. Recently, the Lebanese Government launched the 40 million trees programme, a national initiative steered by the Ministry of Agriculture to plant 40 million trees in public lands within the next 20 years. All the environmental NGOs are invited to work under this project umbrella. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on contemporary reference sites or existing analogues of the pre-degradation ecosystem.In order to identify biodiversity-related success factors of ecological restoration projects, particularly in kfardebian, a major step has to be taken as to have a solid and accurate restoration results. The identification of a reference site is one of the most essential measures to take into consideration in order to have a landscape reference and a natural succession stage example. The most adequate reference site ought to be diversified, home for a great number of plants and animals and where the natural succession stages occur.
Ehden natural reserve in Mont Lebanon fits all of the criteria mentioned above. In fact, Ehden is a relatively large reserve with a surface of 18 Km2 and an altitude range that extends between 1200m and up to 2000 m. It has the same abiotic characteristics as our restoration site. It is considered a home for:
– 1058 plant species with 39 different tree species
– 27 different animal species
This reference site will help us elucidate the animal-plant relationship; promote the reoccurrence of wildlife and the natural regeneration in the pilot site. The project objective is as follows: to evaluate the effect of animal wildlife on the long-term sustainability of the restored forests. To this end, the Project will be relying on a unique opportunity to test in situ a set of parameters affecting plant and animal biodiversity interactions under three different situations. Two major components are identified: (i) Effect of fencing on sites biodiversity and ecological succession dynamics, and (ii) Role of animal wildlife in the self-sustainability of the restored forests.
Implementing partner : Jouzour Loubnan (NGO)

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Evaluate the effect of fencing on biodiversity from the restored site:

The project relies on a unique opportunity to test in situ a set of parameters affecting plant and animal biodiversity interactions under three different situations. To this effect, we have a site of 65 ha globally fenced, another site adjacent to the first one where planted trees are fenced individually, and a reference site situated at the same altitude and developing under similar climatic conditions and protected since 1992: the Ehden Nature reserve. Having a reference area that is as near as possible to the natural conditions of the area to be restored is useful as benchmarks, for understanding ecological processes, and as sources of plants and animals to be used in assisted restoration. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Selection of appropriate genetic resources to be used for reforestation:
On one hand, it is crucial to work with material of confirmed origin: a DNA barcoding technique will be applied to barcode all the resources to be used in reforestation. 

The challenge of matching adapted populations to current and future environmental conditions is often complicated by the extent and the type of degradation and disturbance involved. Given the uncertainty of future climate predictions, the most prudent approach to preparing for climate change for most restoration efforts is to select as much as possible the genetic and species diversity available near the restoration site or in sites with similar (macro) environmental conditions, which should allow natural selection to take its course and move the restored population in the required direction. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Evaluate the effect of animal wildlife on the long-term sustainability of the restored site:

In the framework of this project only the animals dispersing the seeds are studied. In the framework of the ecological restoration approach, knowing what each animal species eats and through which animal species each plant species disperses its seed, is crucial to help managers decide what to plant if they want to attract and promote wildlife. In addition, it allows us to define which plant needs which animals to disperse its seeds and ensure the ecosystem sustainability.
A suite of approaches has been used based on the identification of consumed species by characterization of animal DNA collected based on non-invasive sampling techniques. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Promote key results in roundtable discussions among different national focal points, and at relevant international meetings, showcasing results and exchanging insights for areas facing similar challenges. 
Achieve a desirable species composition: Observing the reference site for landscape restoration is helping us determine the ecological succession stages that we will try to imitate in Kfardebian. Pioneer species were identified and the different succession stages are highlighted.
The different trees and shrub species present in Ehden nature reserve are identified and their life cycle documented. The fruit type is defined and its dispersion mode precised. A list of species light demanding and considered as pioneers is prepared. These species will be introduced in early restoration activities.

Concerning the fencing effect on the flora of our forest restauration site, a flora assessment was conducted the first of every month in the 6 plots mentionned in the previous report. The flora survey contains the species found in each plot, their frequency and dominance. During the reporting period, we have covered the survey of the summer season 2017, autumn , fall and spring 2018. Plants observed are identified and checklists are being prepared for each plot. Statistical analysis will be performed at the end of the collection season and compared site by site and season by season. Results will be included in the next report. Recover ecosystem functionality: In order to unravel the herbivore regime of some animals present in our forest ecosystem, define their behavior as seed dispersers and thus their role in the sustainability of our forest, we undertook a non invasive sampling technique. The DNA included in the scats that animals leave behind will reveal animal diet and animal identity. To be able to compare the DNA sequences found in the scats to a reference database, we should construct first our own plant and animal database. Scat collection is a continuous procedure taking place every month in Ehden Nature reserve using the optimized protocol.
A plant monitoring plan will be prepared based on permanent plots inside the three sites A, B and C. Monitoring will be performed over a long period since forest ecosystems do evolve over time and cannot be fully understood in two years research timeframe.
A data base with animal traces (footprints, hair, feces, ..) will be developed allowing the future completion of the ecological web interactions by adding new species and by making a link between biological traces and genetic markers.
Finally, these inventories will be added to the other research components for the ecological restoration project in order to have a more comprehensive view from the soil microorganisms to the interactions between plants and between animal and plants.
Other initiatives: Results of this project will be used in the context of a FAO-FLRM project and by the 40 million trees initiative by the Ministry of Agriculture. "

watersheds were in desperate need of repair. To help restore the Big Thompson River
and prepare for future flooding events, the Big Thompson Watershed Coalition hired
Stantec to perform stream restoration design and implementation.Stantec worked on the assessment and design documents to guide rehabilitation and
resilience efforts for the Big Thompson River, its floodplain, and its riparian corridor
including the Lower Canyon (Cedar Cove and Jasper Lake reaches) and West Loveland
(Riverview to Morey). The goal was to promote long-term resiliency and create a design
that incorporates stakeholder input while also developing a restoration plan that could be
successfully implemented.To meet this project’s goals, Stantec’s design reset the ecological trajectory of the river
reaches based on historical context and contemporary boundary conditions and was
designed to handle the hydrological demands of the future. The design process involved
a diverse group of stakeholders, including private land owners that were concerned
about their property’s riverfront. The resulting design used the existing river’s location,
including its physical and biological characteristics to enhance riparian function and
prepare this watershed for future flooding events.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/fifth-avenue-dam-evaluation-and-removal/	USA: Ohio: Fifth Avenue Dam Evaluation and Removal	United States of America			"When the 5th Avenue Dam was built on the Olentangy River in 1935, it served a useful
purpose – providing cooling water for a power plant on The Ohio State University
campus. Decades later, with the power plant long gone, the dam was not necessary.
Dams often impair the health of the rivers by disrupting natural flow patterns and
creating lake-like conditions that trap pollutants, sediment and obstruct the migration
of aquatic species. That’s exactly what was happening behind this dam, so the City of
Columbus retained Stantec to design its removal and restore 1.6 miles of the river to a
more natural state.During the feasibility study, we established that only the top two feet of the dam needed
to be removed from the western half of the 470-foot long dam. Our natural channel
design deepened the river, reestablished its natural flow and form and created four
fringe wetland complexes. More than 7,500 mussels of 13 distinct species were rescued
and relocated to safer areas upstream and downstream of the restoration area. Seven
new riffles now provide prime habitat.Nearly all sediment that was trapped behind the dam was recycled to restore and
expand the river’s banks. The newly narrowed and vegetated banks offer a continually
evolving green space that the university has already embraced as a center for research
and recreation. Now canoers and kayakers can freely paddle through this newly restored
stretch of the river, and fishermen are returning to the area as its biodiversity rebounds.

This plan included the placement of fill on an upland island and required a temporary wetland impact to mangrove habitat. Our plan will eventually remove the overgrown nuisance and undesirable plant species, enhance the mangrove swamp, and provide public access and educational opportunities.Although the site presented poor soil conditions, low upland elevations, and temporary wetland impacts, our team was able to successfully navigate these challenges and present a comprehensive restoration plan to the County that will help conserve and protect valuable coastal habitats in Southwest Florida.

downstream of the Wolf Creek dam, which forms Lake Cumberland. Water level
fluctuations below the dam impaired trout spawning. Using in-lieu fee funding, the
Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources hired the Design-Build team of EcoGro/Ridgewater/Stantec to design and build a one-mile extension downstream to create one of Kentucky’s first self-sustaining trout stream capable of supporting spawning.Stantec’s responsibilities included completing a geomorphic assessment, preliminary
and final design, permitting, hydraulic modeling, jurisdictional waters determinations,
construction observation services, as-built survey, and post-construction monitoring.
The project design focused on supporting all trout life stages and included a variety
of stream types including A, C, and D channels. In the braided D-channel sections, a
variety of wetlands and vernal pools were constructed to provide rearing habitat. The
lower portion included a step pool system designed to promote fish passage from the
Cumberland River up into Hatchery Creek. A fish migration barrier on the upper portion
of the project was also designed to separate areas with different fishing restrictions.The design consisted of approximately 6,000 linear feet of channel with dozens
of oxbow features, and numerous in-stream structures including toe wood, lunker
structures, step pools, and a variety of riffles. Wood harvested from the site was used
throughout to help create a natural looking stream system and provide habitat.Dams & Hydrology, Fisheries & Aquaculture, Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry This project was funded through the need to mitigate for roadway construction and mining impacts through an In-Lieu Fee Program.  Under an In-Lieu Fee Program, mitigation funding is pooled together to pursue larger more comprehensive funding.  Prior to restoration, the site was subject to erosion, resulting in sedimentation to the Cumberland River. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Reference reaches used for the project were selected based on desired stream type and aquatic habitat.  The project included a high and low gradient C channel, a DA channel and a step pool system (A channel).  The site was also challenging, because the amount of flow in the channel was influenced by the trout hatchery and was larger than what would normally occur relative to the contributing drainage area.  This was a factor in determining appropriate reference streams.

Numerous stakeholder meetings were held before and during the project to address issues/concerns.  Since the project has been completed, numerous field tours of the site have been completed.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: The project focused on eliminating a sediment source to the Cumberland River and elimination of invasive plants. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: The project raised groundwater in the vicinity of the site, which enhanced existing and restored wetlands.  The project also significantly increased riffle habitat. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Habitat features worked into the project were designed for three species of trout.  Terrestrial habitat features for a variety of mammals were also included in the project. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): The project greatly increased complexity within the channel bed and added to diversity within the stream channel and surrounding areas. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Ecosystem function was greatly enhanced over the impaired channel which previously existed. This was achieved through added complexity, raising the groundwater, increasing the quality and amount of fringe habitat around the channel, creating macro-invertebrate habitat, etc. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): The project focused on reestablishing hyporheic flow within the channel and overall ground water/surface water interaction. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: The project resulted in a robust fishery which has increased tourism to the community. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Erosion has been successfully eliminated by the project. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: Based on groundwater readings at the site, the project has raised groundwater in the vicinity of the stream, which has enhanced existing and restored wetlands.  The project also significantly increased riffle habitat. Achieve a desirable species composition: Vegetation throughout the restoration project is in the process of being monitored.  Results indicate a diverse composition of species is being established at the site.  With respects to diversity of species of trout at the site, over time the restored reach is exhibiting an increase in rainbow trout, which is also occurring in areas outside of the restoration. Reinstate structural diversity: The project greatly increased complexity within the channel bed and added to diversity within the stream channel and surrounding areas. Recover ecosystem functionality: Ecosystem function was greatly enhanced over the impaired channel which previously existed. This was achieved through added complexity, raising the groundwater, increasing the quality and amount of fringe habitat around the channel, creating macro-invertebrate habitat, etc. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: The project focused on reestablishing hyporheic flow within the channel and overall ground water/surface water interaction.  Results of ground water monitoring indicate that the overall interaction has been enhanced.

But these actions have often lacked coordination and public acceptance. The project’s goals are (1) to identify restoration priority areas in Mediterranean landscapes, integrating the multiplicity of stakeholder perspectives, socio-economic changes and climate change, (2) assess the impact of restoration scenarios on the provision of ecosystem services, with particular attention to landscape capacity for carbon sequestration, and (3) identify optimal restoration scenarios based on cost-benefit analysis.
We aim to facilitate the adoption of our protocols in other drylands.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
We have established stakeholder platforms in each working area, formed by hundreds of: farmers, hunters, miners, environmentalists, tourist operators, administration technicians and researchers.
 

Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: In each Demarcation, we have defined Homogeneous Landscape Units in terms of land use and plant cover. Platforms first identified prioritization criteria to be considered in each Forest Demarcation. Each stakeholder had his/her own opinion, and all inputs were taken into account. The elevated number of criteria identified by stakeholders in the Cervillent Forest Demarcation (33) illustrates the diversity of their approaches. Then, all participants weighted the criteria. All the criteria and indicators identified have been mapped  taking stakeholder’s weighting into account.
Later, stakeholders identified the main services provided by ecosystems present in each area and weighted them. As before, we used mapped information of these services or their indicators and multi-criteria models to draw integrated maps of the current provision of ecosystem services.
By using expert knowledge and the integrated provision of ecosystem services, we estimated the difference in the provision of ecosystem services between current and potential (reference) conditions, i.e. the potential gain in ecosystem services that could be delivered by ecological restoration. We also estimated the monetary costs of ecological restoration and then, the cost-effectiveness of ecological restoration actions.
An effectiveness analysis (by combining priority maps and cost) could identify areas with highest increases in the provision of ecosystem services at the lowest cost. And the adopted protocols allowed to invest in ecological restoration will fulfill society aspirations.

Whereas the southern portion of the Yariguíes range was declared a national park in 2005, protecting more than 70,000 ha of the large watershed, the northern half has remained vulnerable to exploitation and is the principal source of water for Zapatoca, San Vicente, Betulia and other regional towns. Extensive conversion of forested habitat to pasture has impacted the northern portion of this catchment basin, and steep slopes have resulted in heavy erosion and loss of topsoil. We are in the process of restoring 30-35 ha of degraded habitat by planting patches of trees or regeneration nuclei. This method provides several advantages over traditional plantation-style planting: 1) it mimics the natural form of forest recovery, creating more habitat heterogeneity; 2) areas in between forested patches will recover passively and can provide space for enrichment planting of later successional species once a canopy cover has formed; and 3) a considerably larger area can be reforested using this method, reducing the cost of restoration/hectare.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) Most degradation in this region is the result of conversion of forested habitat to pasture. Denuded steep slopes coupled with long-term intensive usage for cattle ranching have resulted in heavy erosion and loss of topsoil, which has reduced land productivity and impacted the catchment basin. The reduced volume of water produced by the watershed, coupled with the increased demand placed on limited water resources by cattle ranching and pig farming, have resulted in water shortages and concern for worsening conditions in the future. The municipalities of several towns in the area are concerned and are taking proactive measures to prevent further deforestation in the region. In addition to watershed concerns, local harvesting of hardwoods such as oak and other important economic species such as the wax palm Ceroxylon quindiuense (Arecaceae) have degraded a number of the remaining forest patches in the region. The northern Yariguies range is home to the Spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), an emblematic species that is categorized as vulnerable by the IUCN due to habitat loss throughout its native range. Evidence of the presence of this species within the protected area is widespread and include markings on tree trunks, remains from consumption of bromeliads in many parts of the forest, and scat. An increase in the habitat provided for this species will not only protect but also help increase the population of the species. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).The Yariguíes plateau is part of the western foothills of the eastern range of the Colombian Andes. Given the transitional climatic range and broad range in elevation, this region exhibits extraordinary biotic wealth, which include many endemic and endangered species. It harbors oak forests (Quercus humboldtii Bonpl.), that are characterized by high species richness and also holds the distinction of being the northernmost range for Ceroxylon quindiuense (Arecaceae) the tallest palm in the world, and the emblematic national tree of Colombia. Only 50-60 individuals of this species remain in this area. The oak forest patches that remain in this northern watershed will serve as the reference forest for this study. Three 20×20 m permanent plots were established in three representative patches of forest in 2014 and all trees >10 cm DBH have been identified and censused. In addition, comprehensive inventories of the flora of the entire watershed have been carried out by Daniel Diaz MSc, a botanist who is collaborating on this project. Voucher specimens were collected and deposited at the herbarium in the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (Medellín). A monograph of all species censused is forthcoming and will be used to aid in determinations of new recruits in restored habitats. Restored plots will also be compared directly to reference forest plots to evaluate the efficacy of this methodology.

Monitoring Details: We tagged and measured basal diameter of all individuals immediately after planting. Thereafter, survival and growth of stakes has been monitored every 6 months with visits by undergraduate students from the National University of Colombia (accompanied by one of the senior researchers). The survival of stakes with resprouting of the majority of individuals within the first 6 months were not as high as expected, but the monitoring continues. We anticipate canopy closure within 2 years of planting (Zahawi 2005). In addition to baseline monitoring of stakes additional long-term projects where planned including an examination of seed dispersal to plots (by means of seed traps), natural seedling recruitment, and enrichment planting of seedling in the understory of nuclei and alongside them, are all potential future projects for MS or PhD students from the National University of Colombia in Medellín or another regional University. Start date, including baseline data collection: We started working on the baseline at least five years ago (2013) End Date: We hope to continue working in the area for an indefinite term
Out of a concern for the progressive deterioration of this habitat, a number of local residents began to purchase key properties to insure their long-term protection and allow for habitat recovery. This regional protected area now covers the entire northern Páramo plateau and upper watersheds, which is the spring source for many of the creeks that emerge at lower elevations. All told, >500 ha are now protected, forming a private network of reserves that have been formally approved by the government under the 1996 Protected Areas National System (SINAP) private reserve act. There are now three officially registered reserves as well as a number of other properties that are under consideration. Registered reserves are: El Páramo-La Floresta (RNSC 056-13), La Montaña Mágica-El Poleo (RNSC 080-15), and Traganubes (RNSC 083-15). Finally, several municipalities have voiced strong support for the protection of these watersheds and are actively participating through various supportive measures.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: The process of acquiring the properties of the reserves began more than five years ago. Since then the cattle was removed (main degradation factor) and nature began to do its work. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: We planted 36 individual trees/nuclei, each 15x15 m in size using 9 species (n=4 individuals/species/nuclei). Approximately 8-9 nuclei will be planted per hectare, covering ~20%/ha. Nuclei density was dictated in part by topography and the presence of patches of forest and other landscape considerations. Although only ~6 ha was planted, in all we reforested ~30-35 hectares of degraded habitat using this methodology. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): To plant nuclei, we used large 2m tall vegetative cuttings or stakes. Vegetative cuttings have long been used by farmers to establish live fence rows, and a number of species are known to establish in this manner. Advantages to using this method include: (i) it obviates many precursor steps, including seed collection, seedling establishment and growth in nurseries, and a hardening phase, saving at least ~6 months; (ii) no maintenance in the field, such as clearing of grasses to reduce competition, irrigation, or protection from herbivores; (iii) stakes develop a canopy crown and roots quickly, creating improved microclimatic conditions for natural recruitment and reducing soil erosion on steeper slopes; (iv) all species are hardy and can tolerate the adverse soil conditions in degraded plots; most seedlings would do poorly; and (v) cuttings from adult trees often results in the development of fruit 1-2 yr later, a potential attractant to frugivores and dispersers such as birds and bats. All species are native and many have a number of important functional traits such as fleshy fruit, N-fixation, copious litter production, or fast growth. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): We hope to monitor changes in ecosystem functionality in the coming years Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: Activities carried out to address socio-economic aspects of the project include cooperation with the community of nature reserves of civil society and municipal authorities. 
Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: We have been measuring the changes in the physical conditions of the assembled nuclei duirng the last year and we have found promising results, although it is still too early to obtain conclusive ones. Reinstate structural diversity: While it is early to conclude that structural diversity has been restored, we have found evidence that avifauna has started to use the planted stakes as perches and has contributed to seed dispersal Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Factors that currently limit the recovery of the ecosystem include the poverty of the remnant soils, the changing and sometimes extreme climate, as well as the aggressiveness of the ferns and the foreign forage species.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Since last year we have been checking if the natural reserves have had changes in their economies and livelihoods. So far we can presume changes in the perception of locals and tourists, in reference to natural attractions as well as water availability for consumption in rural sites
Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: The potential for recreation and aesthetic values  has increased. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: None so far. The lessons learned include the recognition of the poverty of the substrata (mistreated by decades of livestock and natural topography), the potential of some plant species (some foreign ones are affected), as well as the failure of some other natives whose responses we had anticipated better than those obtained. The University is developing plans to monitor the implementation and maintain the assemblies in the long term. For now, the University and the members of the natural reserves are responsible for these activities and we maintain the commitment to continue these processes. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/ten-mile-river-aquatic-habitat-restoration-of-anadromous-fish-run-in-east-providence-rhode-island/	USA: Ten Mile River Aquatic Habitat Restoration of Anadromous Fish Run in East Providence, Rhode Island	United States of America	2001	2015-04	"The Ten Mile River restoration project restores diadromous fish migration to the lower part of the Ten Mile River in East Providence, RI. This project’s main goal is to provide fish passage over the first three downstream dams on the river: Omega Pond Dam, Hunts Mill Dam and Turner Reservoir Dam.A feasibility study was first conducted between 2001 and 2002 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Fish passage facilities were constructed at these dams to provide upstream migration of adult blueback herring, alewife, and American shad to historic spawning areas. The project restored these anadromous fish populations, providing alewife access to about 340 acres of spawning habitat and 3 miles of riparian spawning habitat for blueback herring and American shad. Dam construction along this river nearly extirpated these fish populations by obstructing migration routes. The city of East Providence joined in partnership with the Department of Environmental Protection (DEM), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and several others to pursue this project. It has improved the river environment of the watershed, surrounding communities, and Narragansett Bay. DEM projects that these areas will have the potential to support a fish run of over 200,000 river herring and 25,000 shad.Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological), Dams & Hydrology, Fisheries & Aquaculture, Fragmentation, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Many New England coastal rivers like the Ten Mile River provided habitat for various species of anadromous fish. During the last 200 years, dams were built along these rivers to provide water power for industrial purposes. Manufacturing in the Ten Mile River watershed began in the late 1700’s, which initiated the construction of dams to power the new industries. The Boston and Providence Railroad was completed in the mid-1800’s, creating a transportation link between industries along the river, allowing for increased production. Primary industries were jewelry and textiles, along with paper, primary metals and machinery. The river was also used as a conduit for wastewater disposal. All this combined, the river began seeing fragmentation from dam construction as well as poor water quality from human development by the mid-1900’s, which has greatly reduced the populations of fish runs that utilize the habitat in this river.
The three dams in this project were built soon after the city of East Providence was established in 1636. Hunts Mill Dam was constructed by John Hunt in approximately 1770 to provide power to his gristmill. In the early 1800’s, the Omega Pond and the Turner Reservoir Dams were built. The Omega Pond was used for process water for industries like steel product manufacturing. The Turner Reservoir was used as a water supply to East Providence. As a result, these dams not only obstructed fish passage, but also accentuated the discharge these industries put into the river as waste, which severely impacted water quality. The water remained poor in quality up through the 1970’s until the Clean Water Act and Amendments of 1972 were implemented to provide funding for wastewater treatment plants, which led to improvement in water quality of the river. 
In 1984, the Rumford River Laboratories surveyed the Ten Mile River and prepared a report in 1985 that found the overall condition of the river to have improved significantly in the previous decade with better treatment of municipal and industrial wastewaters. Two major problems that remained were metal contamination by copper, lead, and nickel and over-fertilization of aquatic vegetation by phosphate nutrients. These impacts were seen at all levels in the aquatic organisms and fish. In 1999, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted an investigation of Turner Reservoir and found elevated levels of nitrogen and phosphorus that exceeded the water quality criteria of the Environmental Protection Agency for the prevention of algal blooms and eutrophication. This same year, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed its study, known as the Rhode Island Ecosystem Restoration Reconnaissance Report/Analysis, under Section 905(b) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. In the study, the Ten Mile River was identified as a river where anadromous fish could be restored by providing fish passage over the obstructing dams. 
Remnants of original fish runs remain due to efforts of local fisherman. Every spring, herring have returned to the base of the dams, and local fisherman have caught and hauled the fish over the dam to spawn. Within the last 30 years, water quality has improved to support large biological communities of native and stocked fish species, largely due to the Clean Water Act and resulting reduction of discharge by nearby industries. However, restoration of anadromous species that previously inhabited the Ten Mile River could not be accomplished, nor could self-sustaining populations of the species in focus be established without fish passage at the identified dams. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on historical information about ecological attributes at the site prior to degradation.The Ten Mile River watershed includes a drainage area of about 56 square miles, 51 of which are situated in Massachusetts and the remaining 5 of which are in Rhode Island, where this project is focused. The original ecosystem provided habitat for various species of anadromous fish prior to dam construction. These species included blueback herring and alewives, American shad, Atlantic salmon, and catadromous eel.
The river extends from sea level in East Providence, through 21 miles of primarily flat terrain, and up about 250 feet to the headwaters of the river located in Plainville, Massachusetts. Elevation ranges between sea level to 450 feet near the headwaters. Topography is characterized by small hills of glacial origin. Land usage in East Providence is characterized primarily by residential and industrial use, with about 5% open land. The immediate area surrounding the river is overlain by flood plain alluvium. The river basin is underlain primarily by sedimentary rock from the Paleozoic and Precambrian eras. Vegetation in the area vary between deciduous forest, evergreen forest, scrub-shrub wetland and agricultural fields. The river is also associated with large areas of emergent and aquatic bed wetlands, which points to another reason for restoration and protection along its course.
Prior to the industrial revolution of New England, rivers and watersheds maintained healthy ecosystems for anadromous and catadromous fisheries. Healthy populations of alewives, blueback herring, American shad, Atlantic salmon, and the catadromous eel utilized the Ten Mile River watershed, without difficulty maneuvering up or downstream along their migration routes. The anadromous fish species of alewives and blueback herring were sources of forage for resident wildlife populations, including bird species and many marine and freshwater species like striped bass, which are now an integral part of today’s fishery economy of Rhode Island. During industrialization, soil chemistry, vegetation, wildlife populations, hydrology, and water quality began to decline with the construction of manufacturing industries and the dams to power them. Dams obstructed migration routes of species looking to spawn upstream in the watershed, reducing anadromous fish populations and reducing forage for species higher up the food chain. The area also used to be primarily a forested region, but with urbanization throughout East Providence and its transition to a primarily residential and industrial city, the river suffered from urban discharges and has since been on the mend.
Restoration success can be measured by water quality tests of the watershed, which has been improving since the implementation of the Clean Water Act. Monitoring of fisheries and measuring progress toward self-sustaining populations will indicate a measure of overall success of the project as well. There is no plan to return the area to a forested region, but strategies are being implemented to reduce the impact of urban runoff and other adverse influences from the city into the river. Overall health of the Ten Mile River will be a combined effort in measuring species populations, water quality, pollution reduction, and overall ecosystem functioning. The construction of dams along the Ten Mile River has caused reduction of fish populations by decreasing their ability to reach spawning habitat and thereby limiting their ability to spawn upstream. In 1999, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted a study, known as the Rhode Island Ecosystem Restoration Reconnaissance Report/Analysis, under Section 905(b) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. In it, the Ten Mile River was identified as a key site where anadromous fish could be restored if provided fish passage over the dams. In 2001, the organization conducted a feasibility study to survey the sites and develop plans for fish ladder construction at the three dams. The goal of the project is to bring self-sustaining runs of American shad and two species of river herring (blueback and alewife) to the Ten Mile River watershed. Rhode Island’s Department of Environmental Protection has taken responsibility to sponsor the project, and has partnered with several other agencies to organize their goals and see this restoration through. The project not only upholds environmental responsibility of the public-private partnership amongst local, state and federal agencies working with environmental advocacy groups. This endeavor supports cultural and economic resources of the City of East Providence by improving fish populations to enhance commercial fishery productivity and recreational activities at the dams as well for stakeholders in Rhode Island. 

Monitoring Details: Monitoring includes recording adult returns, measuring upstream and downstream passage efficiency, checking of Hunts Mill fish trap, testing water quality, and re-stocking the area if needed. Start date, including baseline data collection: Monitoring began with the completion of construction of the fish passage facilities in 2015. End Date: There is no projected end date, currently. Monitoring will continue until fish populations are sustainable.
Major stakeholders include those organizations that have largely participated in research of the watershed area and have contributed funding to the project. The RI DEM and the Army Corps of Engineers provided a large amount of help in this project, leading the study which created the action plan for project implementation. Other large contributors were the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Environmental Protection Agency. The project was also supported by the Narragansett Bay Watershed Restoration Bond Fund, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council’s Habitat Restoration Trust Fund and the Fish America Foundation. Other large contributors to the project include Save the Bay, the City of East Providence, and the Ten Mile River Watershed Council. 
Residents of East Providence and any participants in the fisheries impacted by the project are significant stakeholders as well. Local fishermen and residents bordering the watershed are a large part of the project at hand. Information containing project descriptions and updates were released by the DEM and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. News articles were also written as the project progressed, all of which maintained inclusion of stakeholders to keep them informed of project activities. 

Description of Project Activities: The Ten Mile River has been studied under several comprehensive habitat and water quality investigations through the restoration efforts of various private, state, local and federal agencies.  Between 1996 and 1997, the Turner Reservoir was stocked with alewives and blueback herring by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. This action was deemed a success, indicated by subsequent netting of juvenile river herring in the fall of those years.  Habitat studies conducted during that time indicated that the Ten Mile River could also support American shad.  These studies evaluated appropriate alternatives to provide fish passage at the three lowermost dams on the Ten-Mile River to restore anadromous fish to their historic upstream habitat.

In 1999, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed the Rhode Island Ecosystem Restoration Reconnaissance Report/Analysis, under Section 905(b) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (WRDA 86). This study identified the three dams that became the three main sites of this project as requiring fish passage to restore anadromous fish to the lower portion of the Ten Mile River. A feasibility study was then conducting in 2001 and 2002 to determine how to accomplish this restoration.

Site inspections were conducted on foot, from a canoe, or by boat. Observations were made of the types of spawning and juvenile habitat for targeted anadromous fish species. Measurements of the width of the stream were taken to aid in habitat area size calculations. Obstructions to fish passage were located, measured for height and width, judged for the most effective type of fish passage methods and the proximity to anadromous habitat. Other characteristics were noted during site inspections including water levels, water characteristics, surrounding land use, presence or absence of anadromous species, wildlife species, substrate types, vegetation types, point sources of pollution or runoff and any of significant characteristics. 

At Omega Pond, a 4-foot wide concrete Denil fishway was installed on the left-side of the dam, facing downstream, adjacent to the northern abutment of the concrete spillway. The fishway is made of reinforced concrete supported by drilled shafts and extends from the base of the dam to the top of the spillway with a 13-foot height. Upstream and downstream cofferdams were required to clear the construction area temporarily. Its downstream entrance is on the left bank of the river at the base of the spillway. It runs along the existing retaining wall, and notches into the left side of the existing spillway to form the exit channel. The entrance channel is 30 inches wide and sits at a 45-degree angle to the direction of river flow. The fishway widens to 4 feet by 135 degrees relative to river flow. After a 10-foot section, the fishway ascends parallel to the spillway for 42.5 feet. At the top of this leg of the ladder, the fishway turns 180 degrees at a 10-foot long turning pool. The fishway then ascends 57.5 feet to an 8.5-foot long exit channel cut into the existing stone spillway and into Omega Pond. To provide downstream passage, a 3-foot wide and 1-foot deep downstream migrant slot was cut into the spillway 20 feet from the left abutment. It is operational during upstream fish migration periods and has mechanisms of stop log control structures at each end that allow for adequate flow during these periods. A smooth surface flume and plunge pool are included for safe passage of juvenile fish.

Similar structures were built at both Hunts Mill and Turner Reservoir Dams. At Hunts Mill Dam, the Denil fishway is located on the right side of the spillway, with its downstream entrance and upstream exit channels located on the right side of the dam and its abutments. After the entrance channel widens from 30-inches to 4 feet and turns 135 degrees, the fishway ascends 35 feet parallel to the riverbank. The fishway then turns 180 degrees at a 10-foor turning pool and ascends 32.5 feet before entering the 10-foot level section. A different feature implemented at Hunts Mill Dam is a fish trap at the fishway exit, which follows this section. It is 8-feet wide and 10-feet long with lifting brails to allow fish transfer. This allows the Rhode Island Division of Fish and Wildlife to relocate excess fish exceeding available spawning grounds to other coastal watersheds. The exit channel from the fish trap is 3 feet wide. 

At Turner Reservoir Dam, a Denil fishway was constructed on the left side of the spillway abutment. Its downstream entrance is at the base of the spillway along the left embankment at a 45-degree angle to river flow. It makes a 135-degree turn and ascends 47.5 feet along the left embankment to a 180-degree 10-foot turning pool, where it proceeds to the exit channel at the left end of the spillway. The upper portion of the fishway is 60-feet long and ends at an exit channel that is 11-feet long. The exit channel is cut into the spillway by 1.1 feet. Both the Hunts Mill and Turner Reservoir Dams required portable dams or coffer dams to clear construction areas of water and allow for construction of the fishways, as did the Omega Dam. Less than 100 cubic yards of bank and riverbed material were excavated at each site and were either replaced or disposed of at an approved upland site. How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Regarding removal of existing threats to the ecosystem (the three dams under manipulation and their obstruction to fish migration routes), the project focused on the construction of fishways. This occurred during the low flow season outside of the seasonal time that existing anadromous fish populations migrate downstream. A Clean Water Act, Section 401 Water Quality Certificate and all other permits needed were obtained prior to construction. These fishways acted to remove the existing threat by allowing access to fish migration routes, but also contributed to reinstating appropriate physical conditions to achieve the desirable species composition of various fish species historically important to the river. Restoring these fish populations will provide forage for existing resident fish populations, like the commercially important striped bass, cod and bluefish. Thus, the activities of this project will support the structural diversity of this area by strengthening the food webs these anadromous fish populations were a part of. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): To address ecosystem functionality, RI DEM is working with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to carry out plans for a pollution reduction strategy known as Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) which will establish improved pollutant loads in the river to achieve better water quality standards in a river heavily affected by the surrounding city pollutant discharge. 
Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: Fishway implementation has been successful at the three dams along the Ten Mile River in East Providence. Project officials and local stakeholders have seen the return of many adult fish, indicating the potential for future sustainable fish populations. Fishways have reduced the fragmentation brought by the dams to increase connectivity along the river. Appropriate physical conditions in terms of migration routes have been achieved. Appropriate water quality standards remain under manipulation. With monitoring still underway, species composition and structural diversity can be seen with significant positive growth since the implementation of the fishways. Recover ecosystem functionality: The Division of Fish and Wildlife for Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management continues to monitor fish populations, as well as the fish trap at Hunts Mill Dam to measure population health and overall health of the river ecosystem. Adult fish runs are increasing, and the fishery industry has benefited from the completion of the project. Ecosystem functionality is a future focus of the river to better the health of the waterways and reduce the amount of pollution entering the river system. 

The fishways have contributed to external exchanges to allow for fish migration to northern portions of the river through reinstatement of connectivity between dams and upriver spawning grounds. Migration routes have been restored to allow access to greater areas of the river and therefore greater gene flow of fish populations. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Overall, the river has experienced fluctuations in its water chemistry that challenges the resiliency of its fish populations and other aquatic organisms, which detracts from the recovery of the entire system. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management is working with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to carry out their plans of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). 
The Clean Water Act of 1972 and its following effects leading up to this project have greatly helped the water quality of the Ten Mile River, which is cleaner today than it has been in decades. However, the effects of the industrial revolution remain in the watershed to hinder the recovery of the ecosystem. 
In 2010, a toxic algal bloom occurred on the Turner Reservoir, which caused a ban on recreational activities between August and September and slowed the re-establishment of fish species by reducing the healthy function of their habitat along the river.
In January of 2013, the Department of Environmental Management held a meeting on a water quality restoration plan for the Ten Mile River in response to improper water quality standards of the river. Testing found that the Ten Mile River and its impoundments (Central Pond, Turner Reservoir, and Omega Pond) do not meet state water quality standards for total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, pathogens and metal content for aluminum, cadmium, lead, and iron. The disproportionate levels in each of these categories negatively impacts aquatic life and recreational use. Elevated phosphorus levels cause excessive growth of aquatic plants and algae, resulting in lower oxygen levels and cyanobacteria blooms. Two of the most significant sources of pollution are wastewater and storm water discharges to the river. Most of the river’s flow during periods of no precipitation consists of treated wastewater discharged from two publicly-owned treatment facilities in Massachusetts. Being highly urbanized, any rain or snowmelt events cause runoff containing pathogens, metals, and phosphorus to flow into the river and further degrade it, limiting the river’s recovery. Other sources of pollutants include contaminated sediments re-introduced to the water column during high river flows, contaminated groundwater, phosphorus released from sediments in impounded portions of the river, and other natural sources such as atmospheric deposition. Pollution reduction strategies have since been adopted through the water quality restoration plan, consistent with the Clean Water Act requirements, formally called the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to establish allowable pollutant loads in the river and achieve acceptable water quality standards.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The implemented fishways are helping river herring reach upstream spawning grounds that had been blocked by dams since the late 1600s. Allowing passage will help balance the ecosystem and enable Rhode Islanders to fish healthy schools of herring. These fish populations will increase, which will provide a food source for striped bass, cod, bluefish and other commercially and recreationally important fish. They are integral parts of Rhode Island’s fishing industry, worth over $200 million annually. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers notes that the project supports an influx of additional forage for existing resident fish populations. All life stages of anadromous herrings are important forage for many freshwater and marine fishes that occur in the Ten Mile River estuary. Having shad and blueback herring established in this river would provide out-migrating juveniles as forage not only for resident warm water species, but also marine and estuarine fish in the Seekonk and Providence Rivers as well, downstream from Omega Pond. Adults would also provide forage to larger fish in Narragansett Bay. As a result, this project supports Rhode Island’s vital fishing industry and economy.
Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: The Ten Mile River itself is a significant recreational resource. The impoundments behind each of the three dams are used for fishing, non-power boating, and other recreational activities like hiking or bird-watching. Fish ladders would positively affect cultural and economic resources of the city of East Providence and its vicinity by providing additional recreational opportunity to view migrating fish and enhancing existing fisheries, especially in Hunts Mill Dam where it is located in a small park already used for hiking and picnicking, having a positive effect on overall productivity. Together with other anadromous fish restoration projects throughout the watershed and other coastal areas of New England, anadromous fish populations will experience substantial increases in population numbers that contribute to restoration of important marine, estuarine, and freshwater fish stocks. This project also aligns with the Coastal America cooperative effort aimed at restoring anadromous fish to the Northeast. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: This project has not had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges. This project is still being evaluated for its success, but has shown promising results since its completion. The Director of the Department of Environmental Management, Janet Coit, has said that thousands of fish have already begun to use the fishways, which indicates progression toward a more self-sustaining ecosystem. The project has improved the river environment for the surrounding community, the watershed and Narragansett Bay.
Work on the project did not finish without presenting challenges. The contractor for the construction of the Turner Reservoir and Hunts Mill Dams, The John Ricchio Corporation of Smithfield, R.I., initially began work at the Turner Reservoir when seepage issues occurred during dewatering stages of the cofferdam. A new approach was required to prepare the area for fish passage construction, and a modification to the contract was made to allow the contractor to install additional sheeting around the cofferdam and along the concrete spillway to maintain integrity of the dam and ensure work can continue with dry conditions. The Omega Pond Dam fishway was constructed last by the Steven & Roger Contracting Corporation. A surprise at this dam introduced a gas line discovered at an unexpected location. Contract terms also had to be renegotiated here with a new design relocating the gas line. Other projects should consider the surprises that can come in an environment like dam construction and consider all safety precautions to ensure a proper construction environment for the people and natural organisms involved.
The Ten Mile River in East Providence was dammed at its mouth near Narragansett Bay in the early 20th century. With the efforts of local fisherman and volunteers who have caught and hauled fish over the dam to spawn, remnants of the original fish runs have remained intact. These efforts ensured that the project’s target fish species were not completely eradicated from the watershed. Small community efforts are just as important, if not more, as large state and federal endeavors. It is critical that we continue to combine our efforts in pursuit of environmental conservation and protection for the sake of our future and that of the natural world. 
This project brought together a diverse community of organizations and individuals from the private, public, local, state, and federal levels to work toward a common goal of restoring a vital ecosystem. Further management will indicate the exact measurable success this restoration project has had on anadromous fish populations and the extensive community, but current status shows that the work each partner of the project has contributed has made a largely positive impact on the state of the Ten Mile River watershed. This points to the truth that restoration projects like this are a critically collaborative effort.  The Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries and the Middleborough Herring Fisheries Commission have, and will continue to stock the upper regions of the watershed to help sustain fish populations on either side of the Massachusetts-Rhode Island border throughout the next several years until fish populations are able to sustain themselves on their own with use of the constructed fish ladders.
The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management currently manages 21 fish runs throughout the state, and is working on further proposed anadromous fish habitat restoration projects on the Pawtuxet, Woonasquatucket, and Pawcatuck Rivers. The Division of Fish and Wildlife will continue monitoring the return of adults and out-migrating juveniles annually to measure migration success of anadromous fish. Annual monitoring will include records of adult returns, upstream passage efficiency, and downstream passage efficiency. The fish trap at Hunts Dam will also be checked periodically to manage fish populations and relocate excess fish if necessary. The Division of Fish and Wildlife will also stock this area with shad and herring for several years to establish spawning populations of fish. Further construction activities at the dams are not anticipated for several years, which should provide sufficient time for any ecosystem components affects by the fishways to recover. No significant releases of sediments from behind the dams are expected to occur from the construction activities.
The Department of Environmental Management Office of Water Resources is also preparing a water quality restoration plan to address the challenges brought by the factors limiting recovery of the river. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/save-the-good-water-of-xingu-y-ikatu-xingu/	Brazil:  Save the Good Water of Xingu – Y Ikatu Xingu	Brazil	2005-06	2030	"Xingu is a famous name due to to the cultural richness of its original inhabitants where the Amazon forest and Cerrado merge in Brazil. There dwell 24 indigenous groups who live, drink, bathe and fish in Xingu river and tributaries. Pollution, silting and deregulation of water flow due to deforestation around Indigenous Territories and conversion to agricultural use, threaten the survival of this people and the sustainability of modern agriculture itself in the region (Figure 1). The Campaign Y Ikatu Xingu “Save the Good Water of Xingu”, addresses this problem and promoted the restoration of circa 5.000 hectares of riparian degraded areas, articulating multiple social actors and stakeholders in the region. The methods developed, based on local and scientific knowledge, included manual and mechanized direct seeding of native species along with green manure legumes and result in high native tree density, fast canopy formation and presence of all functional and successional groups of plants. Our goal is to restore riparian forests in the Xingu headwaters establishing at least 70% canopy cover on an average density of 4.000 saplings of native trees per hectare after 3 years, with species from short, medium and long lifespans. Seeds are sourced by indigenous communities and small landholders gathered in the Xingu Seed Network Association. The simultaneous promotion of ecological restoration at lower costs, water conservation, sustainable household cash income, along with community organization and traditional knowledge were among the factors for different actors to engage in the campaign.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fire & Weather Events, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) The Southeastern Amazon in the state of Mato Grosso has a recent history of intense social and
environmental conflicts between indigenous communities and private enterprises encouraged by the
federal, state and municipal governments to deforest in order to “develop” the regional economy.
Spreading of soy and beef production during the last four decades in the Xingu basin degraded 300.000 hectares around watercourses alone, areas protected by national law. Total deforested area in the Xingu headwaters is 5.7 million hectares, with noticeable increase on the last four decades (Figure 1).
Deforestation of riparian areas around Indigenous Territories, forest fires, urban sewages, farm
agrochemicals and soil erosion are major causes of silting, pollution and deregulation of water flow,
which threaten the survival of indigenous people and the sustainability of modern agriculture itself in
the region (Figure 1). International market movements, such as the global rise on soya price, have been directly correlated to increases on deforestation rates in the state of Mato Grosso. Regional
deforestation is close to its ecological threshold regarding biodiversity resilience. In this context, riparian forests also represent natural ecological corridors for a fragmented landscape. Riparian areas that will undergo restoration with this project are pastures of African grasses with none or low resilience, marked by scarce natural regeneration due to isolation, repeated use of herbicides or fire and three decades of laminar erosion and soil compaction by cattle.
  The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Riparian forests in the region commonly include species from Amazon and Cerradão (Forested
Savannah), in different degrees, depending on its position on these Biomes’ transitional range. Since we are focusing on riparian forests (not wetlands) in the Amazon biome of the Upper Xingu Basin, the reference ecosystem is the Riparian Evergreen Seasonal Forest , according to Ivanauskas et al. (2001) *1. A floristic study in this ecosystem found 268 species: 66% trees; 18% lianas; herbs and shrubs 13%, and epiphytes 1% (Ivanauskas et al. , 2004 ). Kunz et al. (2008) found 728 trees/hectare, of 49 species (DBH ≥ 10 cm) on 200 quadrant points, with Shannon index of 3.17. Stefanello et al. ≥ (2008 ) found 1.688 trees/ha of 69 species with DBH ≥ 5 cm in a 10.500 m2 total sample area. The relatively low richness of the Evergreen Seasonal Forest on the South-Amazonic border have already been documented in other studies, ranging between 51 and 66 tree species per hectare (Ivanauskas et al. , 2004). Our target is to establish between 4.000 and 8.000 saplings per hectare in 3 years, from at least 25 native species, from different life forms and successional groups, developing a 70% coverage canopy.

seeding of native species, sourced from the Xingu Seed Network Association, and green manure legumes resulting in high tree density, fast canopy formation with all functional plant groups present and native fruits that can generate income. We will restore as much area as possible with the support and investment of partners and landowners generating income for traditional communities and small landholders through the Xingu Seed Network. Community organizations are key elements for conserving biodiversity while improving local livelihoods and creating opportunities for empowering women and youth groups.

Monitoring Details: After 2 months, the area is monitored and a selective herbicide (graminicide) may be sprayed if/where the invasive grasses are germinating or re-sprouting.  Monitoring twice a year during the first 3 years will tell if other measures are necessary, such as ant control, chemical or mechanical grass control, reseeding, refencing, etc. After that period, a sample of those areas are monitored every 3 years. Indicators are number of morphospecies, density of trees and other life forms, vegetation cover, invasive species cover. Start date, including baseline data collection: 2010
The ‘shared responsibility’ campaign Y Ikatu Xingu was launched by iSA in 2004 to articulate and
implement a new vision of sustainable development to the Xingu headwaters region. Promoting a
collective action to restore Xingu’s riparian areas, the campaign articulation includes small, medium and big landowners and agribusiness companies, familiar agriculture on rural settlements, indigenous communities and their associations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and government representatives. Communities on rural settlements and indigenous territories act through the Xingu Seeds Network providing native seeds to the restoration projects. Rural settlers are involved in soil preparation, direct-seeding, monitoring and managing. They also help to develop the restoration technologies, as the seed collectors help to develop seed technologies. NGOs are involved in the organization and capacitation of seed collectors and in agroforestry projects in rural settlements and indigenous territories. The governmental sector helps keeping seed storage houses, nurseries and articulating with the rural sector.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Areas are fenced for cattle and cleaned for fire during the first 3 years of restoration. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: On a pasture with invasive grasses, we will first delimitate, spray glyphosate and plow the soil up to 3 times before planting. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: A carefully selected mix of seeds of crops, fruits, green manure (annual and sub-perennial legumes) and
native forest species, known as “ muvuca de sementes ” (seed mix) is mixed with sandy soil for direct
seeding. It is taken care that every Muvuca have a minimum of species of every different lifespan. Minimums: 3 species that live until 3 years old; 5 species that live until 30 years old; 10 species that live until 100 years old and 15 species that live more than 100 years old. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Total seeding density average 300,000 seeds per hectare: 200,000 seeds per hectare of trees,
being circa 50% of short-lived tree species (i.e. 100 years), plus 100,000 seeds per hectare of annual and sub-perennial legumes; 3 seeds/m 2 of jack-beans ( Canavalia ensiformis (L.) DC.), 5 seeds/m 2 of Crotalaria spectabilis Roth, and 2 seeds/m 2 of pigeon peas ( Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.). How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Tree density in our direct seeding restoration areas range from 2,500 to 22,250 trees/hectare, which allows us to not control herbivory of ants or capibaras in most areas. Fast and multistratified canopy cover increase and early flower and fruit production of annual species help ecological dynamics to take part, while a rich litter is generated over the soil, contributing to soil life, humidity conservation and nutrient cycling dynamics. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Though the areas undergoing restoration are on riparian areas protected by law and tend to form ecological corridors, the areas are too small and young to contribute to external exchanges significantly. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: We combine direct seeding techniques with modern or ancient crop planter machines and broadcasting machines and mixes of seeds (“ muvuca ”) collected by a network of Amazon communities that sell through a common association. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: On most areas threats were controlled, but cattle and fires continue spreading on the surroundings. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: Planting 30 to 200 seeds for each expected native adult tree, using some fire-prone species, along with 10 green manure legume seeds per hectare, in high density and reseeding whenever necessary during the four first years are strategies to recover the soil. Achieve a desirable species composition: Tree density in our direct seeding restoration areas range from 2,500 to 22,250 trees/hectare, which allows us to not control herbivory of ants or capibaras in most areas. Fast and multistratified canopy cover increase and early flower and fruit production of annual species help ecological dynamics to take part, while a rich litter is generated over the soil, contributing to soil life, humidity conservation and nutrient cycling dynamics Reinstate structural diversity: All tree lifespan groups are present. Work or time must happen in order to include lianas and epiphytes. Recover ecosystem functionality: All tree groups are present, but full functionality may take longer. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: The areas are strategically positioned along rivers, but little effect can be seen at the landscape level. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Forest fires, hordes of herbivores, uncommon droughts and technical errors on seed production or
direct seeding may jeopardize project goals.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The Xingu Seed Network has been considered a model because it has facilitated, for already 10 years, the production and sale of a substantial volume of seeds (over 175 tons) and generated about one million
US dollars for 450 households. This network now has a commercial production system (over 20
tons/year) through the Xingu Seed Network Association. It is capable of meeting regional market
demand of native seeds while harnessing to help diversify household income sources and livelihoods.
The community organization is a key element, especially for providing opportunities for empowering
women and youth groups.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: The restored areas are mostly surrounding rivers and watersprings, contributing to water quality. Also, economically interesting native plant species are planted. The fruits, nuts and other products can enrich the family’s diet and also become a source of income, selling in street fairs, to markets, pulp factories and schools. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: Indigenous people believe each plant species and animal has its spirit, so we plant spirits, not forests. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: The conversion of degraded pastures into perennial forests will result in the sequestration of tons of
carbon from the atmosphere. Similar forest restoration projects in the region, monitored for carbon
sequestration, expect an average 340 tons of carbon per hectare in 30 years. Everlastingly is a term hard
to guarantee, but we try. In addition to selecting some interesting species with the owner, such as fruits
and medicinal trees, avoiding forest fires and other factors of degradation, the country’s law and
private contracts help protect the areas we select for forest restoration. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: No, but distribution of seed sources and commercial contracts between collectors must be widely spoken of and transparent. 
For fair and good sourcing, previously establish clear agreements with the local communities, concerning how many, how much and what seeds or seedlings will be needed to buy and plant for the projects.
To use big seeding machines and broadcasting machines for direct seeding native species mixed with green manure
(non-native leguminous herbs and shrubs) seeds, adjusting the amount of seeds/hectare is effective for obtaining high density and cover of trees at low cost.
A Native Seed Network of networks is on the way, with help of APPs and online systems linking directly the market with the seed sourcers, allowing collaboration with scientific researchers and seed labs.
 ISA carries on a regular monitoring program of its restoration areas, including technical data collection and stakeholders’ observations in the field, which results in orientations for adaptive management actions that may be necessary. Areas undergoing restoration are managed by its landowners under orientation and in association with ISA during the first three years after planting. Two monitoring methodologies are used: permanent parcels and fast monitoring. Permanent parcels are set and monitored on a dozen of sampled areas for long-term studies. Fast monitoring accounts for site canopy cover, species diversity, grass cover and talks to the landowner on all areas undergoing restoration 2-3 times during the first year, 2 times on the second year and once every 3 years after the third year, until the vegetation reach minimum ecological parameters of density, cover and richness. Areas undergoing forest restoration turn into seed and fruit sources, contributing to economic interests that help keeping presence on sites. "

The vision and kuleana (responsibility) of KOA is to mālama ‘āina (care for the land) and malama lāhui (care for its people) through our valued academic partnerships and community outreach efforts. KOA is located on a 40 acre coastal property – what is known to being a culturally iconic makahiki (festival) site for King Kamehameha I.After nearly two centuries or intensive cattle grazing, this once productive landscape has degraded to a point of extreme degradation. Since the turn of the century, the property, which is the coastal section of an intact ahupua’a (or ancient land division that spanned from ridge to reef) has been decommissioned of ungulates and now zoned as a conservation easement under a special-use management plan.Since, KOA has installed a fresh-water well, storage tanks and irrigation throughout. We intend to reforest the parcel with native species that are ecologically and culturally important to the native Hawaiian culture. Our intent is to create a sediment trap for up-stream wind and rain erosion. Koa also plans to install alluvial berms to divert and disperse seasonal flood water in an effort to mitigate run-off to the ocean.For every aspect of implementation and monitoring, KOA is collaborating with academic, government and NGO agencies. Our mission is to bridge cultural and academia knowledge systems to better prepare the next generation of emerging local students and scientists from a pedagogical perspective.Agriculture & Livestock, Climate Change, Dams & Hydrology, Deforestation, Fire & Weather Events, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) For more than 2 centuries, the iconic cultural site has degraded as a result of intensive grazing and a changing climatic system. The project mission is to restore the water shed through re-vegetative and landscape design that serves as a sedimentation trap. Our vision is to improve the health and function of the inter-tidal marine ecosystem. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Our site is the most seaward landscape of the iconic Leeward Kohala Field System. Stories of the past civilization suggests that this topography served a large, growing  and specialized population. The interesting cultural aspect of the area displays a lifestyle that balances human existence and ecological stability – hence the parable “He Ali’i ka ‘aina; he kaua ke kanaka” – the land is chief; the people its servant. Pedagogical experiential learning that is germane to the people of the area is most important to our mission. Though the goal of this project is to stabilize the near-shore marine environment through land stewardship, our mission is to engage students at all levels – Kohala middle-schoolers: inventory and motoring the inter-tidal splash-zone; Hawaii Community College:  native plant propagation, planting and monitoring; University of Hawaii: conservation planning, run-off monitoring and data analyses, community resources management.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/richmond-heritage-trail-hike-through-history-small-town-passive-recreation-project-emphasizing-local-history-with-paths-accessible-to-all-persons-trailhead-41-30-10-50/	USA: Richmond Heritage Trail “Hike Through History,” Rhode Island	United States of America	2003-01	Phase 1 2017-12, Phase 2 ongoing	"Country Acres Road- Richmond, Rhode Island, was once home to mixed temperate forest with seasonal freshwater wetlands. Now, the bulk of the 47 acres consists of heavily degraded sand and gravel pits. Since extraction has ceased, uneven topography invaded predominantly by Ambrosia artemisiifolia (Common Ragweed) remains.The existing forested wetlands are dominated by an Acer rubrum (Red Maple) canopy and a Clethra alnifolia (Coastal Pepperbush) shrub layer with invasive species including Microstegium vimineum (Japanese Stiltgrass) present.The project goal is to provide passive recreation for all persons. Educational plaques about the heritage and environmental history of Richmond are installed along the main trail. Wildflower seeding at the trailhead is taking place in late fall 2017 to establish wildlife habitat with aesthetic value. A wooden walkway and bridge were also erected in 2017 through the wetland portion of the trail, allowing wheelchair access.The next phase of the project involves restoring the sand pits by installing nitrogen-fixing native plant material beneficial to migratory birds and insect pollinators. The remaining restoration will require ongoing management to eradicate persistent invasive species. An adjacent parcel of similarly degraded land is slated for commercial development but a restoration of native plant species on that property is not likely to occur.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Mining & Resource Extraction Primary cause of degradation is attributed to mining of sand and gravel with resultant habitat fragmentation and presence of invasive species. Wetland area was impounded and ditched for agricultural use, probably cranberry farming during the 1700s and 1800s..
The project area is 85% degraded and soil fertility is extremely low after years of sand and gravel extraction/removal of topsoil and most of the existing vegetation. Topography consists of hills, pits and berms making access for mowing or removal of invasives with riding equipment extremely difficult. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).The reference ecosystem is based on historical records dating back to 1870 describing a privately owned hardwood forest with a dwelling. Information provided by the head of the Richmond Conservation Commission was invaluable in determining the history of the site. The forested swamp through which the boardwalk passes is an invaluable reference ecosystem as this portion of the site was undisturbed by mining operations. Glacial outwash deposits underlie much of the broad Meadowbrook wetland including the forested swampland which makes up approximately 10% of the site overall.
Soils are generally till: unstratified mix of sand, clay, silt and gravel supporting Oaks, Maples and Beech trees. Annual rainfall for this area totals 51.82″ on average with annual snowfall at 29.4″. High temperature averages 81° in July with low temperature averaging 19° in January.
The pre-disturbance condition of the ecosystem was temperate mixed deciduous and conifer forest with seasonal freshwater wooded wetlands.  The goal is to restore the non-forested formerly mined acreage to native grass and wildflower meadow incorporating woody plant material beneficial to wildlife; especially migrating birds and pollinators of all types. Adjustments made to account for the heavily degraded condition post-extractive activity will include installation of nitrogen-fixing plant material to improve soil condition and promote plant diversity. Native tree species will ultimately shade out some of the invasive Ambrosia artemisiifolia.
The land was acquired as part of the Town approval process for the adjacent Richmond Commons development. The Town seeks to provide passive recreation and exercise for residents as well as an important learning opportunity on the historic, cultural and ecological legacy of the town. The ultimate goal is to secure permanent access to adjoining lands so that a future trail connection will link the Heritage Trail at Meadowbrook wetland with the state’s North-South trail in the Acadia Wildlife Management Area, approximately 2 miles to the northwest. Another goal there is to relocate the North-South Trail from the heavy-traffic Route 138 to an off-road alignment for user safety and increased aesthetic values.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Citizens of the Town of Richmond are the primary stakeholders.  All information relating to the project is available to the public at the Town Hall less than 1 mile from the site. There have been numerous articles online and in local publications promoting the opening of the trail, as well as calls for volunteers to local grade school and University students, scout groups and local residents. It is hoped that the trail will be incorporated into history and ecology lessons for students of the Richmond Elementary School which is within walking distance of the site. 
In addition, the adjacent land is owned by a developer with plans to build a shopping mall and luxury housing units.

Description of Project Activities: Degraded banks around wooded area were shored up with granite rock and boulders. (2)
 A blue-blazed hiking trail through the wooded area was delineated. Level paths of crushed bluestone were created to provide an ADA-compliant loop trail featuring a wooden bridge and picnic deck built over the wetland areas.(Socio-economic) Plaques with historic information and photos pertaining to Richmond history and environment are placed along the trails.  At the trailhead, approximately 1 acre of degraded sand and gravel is in the process of being restored to open grassland and wildflower areas for pollinators and wildlife habitat as well as aesthetic value.(3, 4, 5)  A parking lot with a wooden edge railing for five vehicles was built to include one designated handicapped vehicle space. Signage was added at the entrance to the parking lot describing rules for use. Signage along Route 138 at the Country Acres Road entrance is forthcoming.(Socio-economic factors) How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Existing threats to the ecosystem in the form of invasive plants and unmanaged invasives on adjacent land have yet to be eliminated. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: Appropriate physical conditions have been partially reinstated with the shoring up of degraded banks. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Desirable species composition partially achieved by overseeding with a variety of conservation wildflower seed mix over approximately one acre at the trailhead. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Reinstate structural diversity: very little to date ( see #3) How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Ecosystem functionality has yet to be recovered in 80% of the project area. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Re-establishment of external exchanges with the surrounding landscape is minimal in all but 20% of the project area. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: Level paths of crushed bluestone were created to provide an ADA-compliant loop trail featuring a wooden bridge and picnic deck built over the wetland areas. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Extent of recovery to date is barely 10% overall. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Adjacent acreage remains heavily degraded with Ambrosia, an especially difficult plant to eradicate due to heavy seed bank remaining viable for 20 years. Commercial development of the adjacent area has yet to begin, so for now the Ambrosia remains.  Common Annual ragweed is notoriously herbicide-resistant. Topography greatly limits access for mowing, mechanical scything or herbicide application. It is recommended that a combination of all three is necessary to control the Ambrosia.

Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: There is now a one-half mile of ADA-compliant hiking trail open to the public. Hiking is possible throughout the 47 acres including an additional one mile of trail and gravel road connecting to the ADA compliant section. Beautifully executed, weatherproof plaques offer local cultural, historic and environmental information with easy-to-read color graphics and enlarged archival photographs.

Trails are open to all, including persons with leashed dogs, and bicycles. Although 75% of the restoration is undone, the existing blazed “blue trail” is also a very nice walk.  The remaining half mile of gravel road, although rough, also provides a walking or bicycle trail. Evaluation is ongoing. Seeding open areas with native annuals and perennials will gain momentum as time goes by and plant material is left to re-seed.  Nitrogen-fixing plants and shrubs beneficial to songbirds and migrating birds need to be installed to shade out undesirable plants, improve the soil quality, and begin combating the persistent Ambrosia seed bank. 
Regular maintenance mowing and or burning of Ambrosia areas needs to be implemented and maintained. There is a good opportunity here to use roadside brush cutting equipment to address the ragweed problem. Year-round maintenance of the ADA trail will be necessary to preserve access and reduce instances of washed out areas for example, that render the path impassable to wheelchairs or strollers. A phased long-term restoration and management strategy is in the process of being developed with the hopes of obtaining more grant money to fund ongoing work. The 1.5 mile trail is functional and will be mostly self-sustaining. There are plans to weed out the Microstegium and replace it with Impatiens capensis. The method to restore this small bit of wetland is as yet unclear as the Impatiens seeds are difficult to germinate and take two years to do so. Other plant alternatives such as Carex are being explored. As far as the bulk of the restoration-the sand and gravel pits-the Ambrosia must be eradicated and to date the most logical and effective method would seem to be a controlled burn done by the town. Data review and search is being done on possibly planting nitrogen-fixing perennials such as clovers and Baptisia, as well as shrubs and trees beneficial to birds and other wildlife. This practice could begin to repair the degraded soil making it hospitable for more diverse vegetation. It is also hoped that newly installed trees may eventually shade out the ragweed. There is also the ongoing problem of the unmanaged acreage abutting this project that continues to be covered with Ambrosia.
Any long-term management plan at present is carried out primarily by volunteers from the Richmond Conservation Commission, the Town of Richmond.DPW and local residents.
Grants and ongoing funding sources are in the works. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/united-states-new-england-new-england-cottontail-project/	USA: New England Cottontail Project	United States of America	2009	2030	"The New England Cottontail Project is a restoration effort with the objective to restore the New England Cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) to their native habitats through the creation of young forest and captive breeding programs. A young forest is an early successional forest that is created through managing and maintaining techniques such as clear cutting and prescribed burn. Contributing factors to the decline of the New England Cottontail populations are habitat loss due to fragmentation and competition with the Eastern Cottontail. The Eastern Cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) were introduced into the region in the last century from states such as Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas and later became invasive through their rapid expansion.The restoration efforts for the New England Cottontail (NEC) commenced in 2009 when state/federal biologists convened to organize efforts and will be continued until 2030. The restoration efforts were put into effect after the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service petitioned to list the New England Cottontail under the ESA (Endangered Species Act) in 2000. In 2006, the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service designated NEC as a “candidate” under the ESA and in September of 2015 the listing of the NEC was no longer warranted due to demonstrated success of conservation efforts.  Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Competition with the invasive Eastern Cottontail is one of the leading causes of the decline in the New England Cottontail (NEC) populations. The Eastern Cottontail was introduced from its native range elsewhere in North America in the 1800s and 1900s for hunting purposes but it wasn’t until the 1960s that this species started to become the predominant rabbit throughout New England. The Eastern Cottontail was able to dominate because of their better success rates at inhabiting fragmented areas. This is due to the species not needing a large area to live and reproduce unlike the NEC. Through causes of degradation such as rapid urbanization and the maturing of forests, they were able to expand and use smaller areas such as backyards to inhabit. This caused the NEC’s habitat to be reduced by 86% percent resulting in five isolated populations in the region (New England Cottontail Regional Technical Committee. 2017. Best Management Practices for the New England Cottontail).
The lack of young forest magnifies the competition for resources and habitat between the two rabbit species. Young forest (NEC habitat) is less available due to the increasing rate of urban development throughout the New England states, natural forest succession, and the lack of natural disturbances in the region. Urban development has fragmented the natural habitat of the NEC by decreasing the amount of incidences of natural flooding or burning that once took place historically in these areas.These are important factors in the natural process of forest succession and the main reason many of the forests today throughout New England are old-growth. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).The reference ecosystem for this restoration project is the historical young forests. Today only 2% of woodlands are made up of young forests which are mainly inhabited by the Eastern Cottontail.  A young forest can be defined by a variety of different habitats because it is the shoots and sprouts of trees following a disturbance. These habitats could include young forest with native and nonnative shrub understory, successional forest with trees 3 inches to 6 inches, seedling-sapling forest, pitch pine or scrub oak woodland, shrubland native and nonative dominated, old field, grassland, meadow, wet meadow, and forested or shrubland dominated wetlands.
There are a variety of different flora that compose the dense thicket needed for young forest habitats which include alder (Alnus), blueberry (Cyanococcus), mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), dogwood(Cornus), pitch pine(Pinus rigida), scrub oak(Quercus silicifolia), honeysuckle (Lonicera), barberry(Berberis), multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora), autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellate), winterberry (Ilex verticillata), and viburnums. In addition to the numbers of the NEC dwindling due to lack of young forest habitat, more than 60 mammals, birds, and reptiles are now classified as Species of Greatest Conservation Need in New England due to lack of young forest. Some of these species include American woodcock (Scolopax minor), eastern towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), prairie warbler (Setophaga discolor), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), Canada lynx(Lynx Canadensis), and the eastern massasuaga (Sistrurus catenatus).
The structure of a young forest habitat consists of dense horizontal and vertical woody cover 3 to 15 ft high. This includes multiple layers of vegetation and having a minimum stem density of 20,000 stems per acre. This is important because woody cover shorter than 3 feet does not give enough cover while trees higher than 15 ft have a canopy that shades out too much of the understory. The dense cover is important to species that use the young forest as a habitat due to avoidance of predators and they supply a food source during the winter months.
Before European settlers, young forests were maintained by wildfires and storms that would level acres of shrubs and trees. By the 1900s much of the young forest was returned from settlers clear cutting land for agriculture and timber. By the middle to the twentieth century more than 60% of the woodlands were young forest due to young forest taking about 10- 20 years to mature after a disturbance occurs. By the 1960s, young forest habitat started dwindling because of the lack of these disturbances and maturing of the woodlands.
The majority New England’s landscape is composed of temperate forest. These are forests receiving about 16.24 inches annually and in the summer months being at a high of about 70⁰F and in the winter months a low of 18⁰F. Currently,  the majority of these temperate forest are old-growth forests. The restoration effort for the New England Cottontail Project was initiated in 2009 after the species was petitioned in 2000 by the U.S Fish and Wildlife to be listed under the ESA. In 2011 the regional New England Cottontail Conservation initiative was formally established and in 2012 the regional conservation plan was approved. The conservation strategy for the New England Cottontail was developed by Dr. Steven Fuller, Anthony Tur, and with input from the New England Cottontail Technical Committee. The petition was later rejected due to the success of the conservation efforts.
The goal now is to continue these efforts in creating, maintaining, and managing the NEC habitats through parts of New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine, and New Hampshire.  This is done with the objective of increasing NEC population numbers in each of the sub focus areas selected. This is important because the NEC is the only native rabbit to New England. Initial predicated goals for rabbits re-established in focus areas was calculated by biologists using Focus Area Status Screening Templates (FASST) estimates based on local knowledge, partial surveys, observations in the field, and professional judgments on current populations.  The most feasible goal total for all sub focus areas are 17,500 rabbits, the highest potential goal is 34,500, and the FASST population estimate is 16,687(Fuller, S. and A. Tur. 2015. New England Cottontail Conservation Progress).

Monitoring Details: The NEC project is still in the early stages of creating habitat for the NEC and is assessing monitoring protocols on a yearly basis to improve their accuracy. A Research and Monitoring Work Group was created to prioritize 8 main monitoring objectives for the project. These objectives are listed below (Fuller, S. and A. Tur. 2017. Conservation Strategy for the New England Cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) pg.54-55):

Objective 201: Quantify Extent of Habitat Conservation
Partners must develop a standardized definition of NEC habitat, along with monitoring methods to establish baseline habitat levels. Clear nomenclature and monitoring protocols will let conservationists periodically evaluate the quantity and location of potential habitat, including at the landscape level. They will help managers identify trends in habitat availability, such as a loss of habitat to development, which may limit the effectiveness of this Strategy. 

Objective 202: Develop Regional Monitoring Protocol 
To determine habitat occupancy rates by NEC based on data from collecting fecal pellets, conservationists must develop protocols that lead to accurate surveys. Pellet survey detection protocols are being developed and refined by researchers at the University of New Hampshire. The next step, anticipated to be completed by scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey, is to incorporate the detection protocols in a range-wide survey design to ensure high quality presence/absence data at a patch-scale resolution that may be used to assess our landscape design and detect landscape-scale population trends. 

Objective 203: Measure Habitat Occupancy Rates 
In the future, intensive pellet sampling may be used to derive a population index. NEC pellet surveys generate a growing dataset useful in monitoring the genetic health of populations. Genetic monitoring is also incorporated in the zoo captive-breeding program (objective 403) to manage the risk of inbreeding and outbreeding in wild populations that may be augmented through the release of captive-born NEC.

Objective 204: Presence/Absence Distribution Surveys 
Although the current distribution of the NEC is well documented (Litvaitis et al. 2006), wildlife biologists need to conduct ongoing research to determine any changes in the distribution of the species. Confirming the presence of NEC in given habitat areas may signal that the conservation effort is working; conversely, decreases in NEC presence may raise additional concerns that need to be addressed. 

Objective 205: Measure Vegetation Response to Management Assessing
The response of vegetation to management is critical to determine the effectiveness of management techniques in generating habitat suitable for NEC. Such vegetation monitoring will also let researchers and managers asses the condition of the habitat in targeted stands so that they can efficiently plan future management actions. 

Objective 206: Monitor Effectiveness of Vegetation Management
The work group will conduct quality control activities to determine the effectiveness of vegetation management and recommend any necessary modifications to the vegetation management protocol.

Objective 207: Monitor Disease and Parasitism 
Conservationists must evaluate both captured individual NEC and populations of NEC to determine the presence of diseases and parasites and, if needed, judge their possible impacts on NEC populations. There is little evidence to suggest that disease or parasites have been or are a limiting factor for NEC; therefore, no conservation measures to manage these factors have been proposed. 

Objective 208: Monitor Genetic Health of Small Populations
To effectively manage small populations and to inform decision-making on the identity of founders for captive breeding, it is necessary to monitor the genetic health of small populations of NEC. The Techcom and work groups will coordinate this monitoring on an on-going basis, as needed.
There are numerous stakeholders within the region that are in cooperation  for the NEC Project. These include state agencies within Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire, and New York. In addition to state agencies, federal agencies such as the U.S Fish and Wildlife Services (USFW), USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service ( NRCS), U.S Geological Survey (USGS) and nonprofits such as Wildlife Management Institute (WMI) and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF). Additionally, much of the land that is used to create these habitats is owned by private landowners.
To keep all stakeholders informed on the progress of the project, a report is created annually by The Technical Committee. It is a performance report reviewing the 83 objectives outlined in the original conservation strategy.  This report is used as a way to update the New England Cottontail Executive Committee, to identify uncertainties underlying performance and to develop recommendations to improve the conservation strategy.
Additionally, websites were created for both the New England Cottontail Project and the Young Forest Project that contain any information that is needed for the general public or private landowners who want to be or are already involved. On these websites the public has access to the Annual Performance Reports, Young Forest Guide for Landowners, the Conservation Strategy, and Best Management Practices.

Description of Project Activities: To determine areas that are suitable to create habitat for the NEC, biologist use field surveys and computer models to identify focus areas. Forty-one focus areas have delineated in the region with the capacity to support 80 metapopulations (New England Cottontail Regional Technical Committee. 2017. Best Management Practices for the New England Cottontail). How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: To create young forest habitat and to eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem there are a variety of different methods that can be used. These methods include:
- Tree/shrub cutting 
- Heavy-Duty Mowing/Mulching
- Field Mowing
- Forest Harvesting
- Controlling Invasive Plants
- Prescribed Burning.

These methods are used to cut down or eliminate trees/plants that are shading out any understory that is need for the NEC to live and thrive. They are used to mimic the natural disturbances that occurred periodically throughout history before the land was urbanized. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: Once the threats are eliminated, young forest is created with the hope that natural regeneration will take place and a dense thicket will grow in this newly disturbed area. At this time the site will also be assessed for invasive species and they will be treated as needed to insure that the habitat that grows back is predominately native. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: To establish a desirable species composition a twelve step guide is followed which is outlined in the Best Management Practices for the NEC. (New England Cottontail Regional Technical Committee. 2017. Best Management Practices for the New England Cottontail):
These steps include:
1.Manage, maintain, and create patches of habitat at least 10 acres in size and ideally 25 acres or larger.
2.On sites occupied or potentially occupied by NEC, conduct management in incremental phases, ensuring that enough suitable habitat is left while work is being completed on nearby or adjoining habitat.
3.Manage vegetation on known NEC sites from September to March to avoid disturbances during the species nesting season.
4.Where possible, maintain at least 25 acres of good NEC habitat in a local area at all times.
5.Maximize the ratio of patch size to edge effect by creating roughly circular or square habitat patches rather than long linear ones.
6.Provide a minimum of 20,000 stems per acre of woody vegetation at a height of 3 to 15 feet to offer ample food and cover when converting mature forest to young forest habitat.
7.Where possible, create and maintain habitat patches within 3 kilometers (approximately 2 miles) of each other.
8.Where possible, create habitat patches connected by travel corridors (shrubby utility rights-of-way, shrubs growing along roadways, forests with dense shrub understories, streamside brush, shrub swamps, and forested swamps with a shrub understory) that NEC can use to disperse to other suitable habitat. 
9.In old fields and shrublands, selectively remove trees larger than 3 inches in diameter ate breast height or 15 feet high to prevent them from shading out lower thick vegetation.
10.Where cover is limited or will be reduced following habitat management actions, construct brush piles to provide NEC with shelter from predators and inclement weather.
11.Where possible, retain low-growing native shrubs, low-branching conifers, evergreen shrubs with limbs close to the ground, and rock piles, all of which provide good hiding cover to NEC.
12.Where appropriate on given property, maintain 10 to 20 percent, or a minimum of 10 acres, in young forest or shrubland habitat less than 15 years. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): After the creation of the young forest site following the 12 step guide and some years of regeneration, the structural diversity should be reinstated to that of a young forest structure. This habitat will support the NEC and other wildlife that uses the young forest as a habitat. Reintroducing rabbits from the captive breeding programs will also be a part of re-instating structure by increasing populations. The range-wide population goal for the species is 13,500 animals. (Fuller, S. and A. Tur. 2015. New England Cottontail Conservation Progress). How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): If regeneration struggles to occur at a single site, a series of seeding and plantings will be conducted. This will help create and return functioning flora to the site so that a suitable young forest can take root and grow. This will create a thick understory that will allow a suitable habitat for NEC populations to inhabit and reproduce. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Metapopulations of the NEC need 25 acres of land for a successful habitat that are a minimum of 10 acres and contain patches within 2 miles of other good habitat. This is important for the dispersal of the NEC, so that populations do not become isolated.  In some areas where there are forests stands adjacent to shrubs or a field, this can be used as a shrub corridor that serves as dispersal route for NEC. These corridors need to be maintained regularly by controlling tree cover to assure they can be used efficiently and effectively by the NEC when traveling to adjacent patches. In addition, it is important that these patches allow for enough sunlight to promote shrub growth and regeneration to create the shrub thicket that is needed for protection and food supply. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: As of the New England Cottontail Regional Initiative 2016 Performance Report, 10,365.2 of the 27,000 acres goal set by the USFW of habitat management and restoration have been planned or implemented (Ecosystem Attribute Category 1).  It is estimated that over 40% of the acres reported have been fully implemented. In addition, over 10,000 acres of naturally self-sustaining habitat have been recognized. Vegetation surveys are completed yearly in every sub focus area that has been created. Studies measuring vegetation and population responses appear encouraging but additional time is needed to affirm that prescribed management is working (Ecosystem Attribute Category 2&3). Reinstate structural diversity: Information provided from the New England Cottontail Conservation Progress report has identified that 15 focus areas meet the population size criteria, and their goals total 10,500 rabbits (Ecosystem Attribute Category 4). Six additional focus areas are believed to have population levels approaching their individual goal levels and, this combination with 21 other focus areas will exceed the 13,500 goal and meet the population configuration requirements established by the USFWS (Fuller, S. and A. Tur. 2015. New England Cottontail Conservation Progress) (Ecosystem Attribute Category 4 & 5).

In addition to creating habitat, ongoing captive breeding programs are assisting with increasing wild populations by breeding NECs and reintroducing them. Results from New England Cottontail Regional Initiative 2016 Performance Report show that in captivity there was only 33.8% survival rate of produced zoo rabbits. There were also 31 rabbits in 2016 that have been captured to augment the captive populations. In addition, reproduction has been confirmed at two out of five release sites (Ecosystem Attribute Category 4). Recover ecosystem functionality: In addition to creating habitat, ongoing captive breeding programs are assisting with increasing wild populations by breeding NECs and reintroducing them. Results from New England Cottontail Regional Initiative 2016 Performance Report show that in captivity there was only 33.8% survival rate of produced zoo rabbits. There were also 31 rabbits in 2016 that have been captured to augment the captive populations. In addition, reproduction has been confirmed at two out of five release sites (Ecosystem Attribute Category 4).

Captive facilities at Roger Williams Park Zoo in Rhode Island and two outdoor pens at Great Bay,New Hampshire and Ninigret National Wildlife Refuges in Rhode Island have been established. These facilities supported the release of 131 NEC to NH and Patience Island in RI (Fuller, S. and A. Tur. 2015. New England Cottontail Conservation Progress). These populations are being monitored yearly and assessed for reproduction and survival rates through fecal collections and genetic testing. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: In the conservation strategy approved in 2012, six key uncertainties are discussed as to how they could be possible limiting factors throughout the duration of the project with possible monitoring solutions suggested. These uncertainties are still being evaluated yearly in the annual performance reports (Fuller, S. and A. Tur. 2012. Conservation Strategy for the New England Cottontail (Sylvilagustransitionalis) pg.114-116).
1.Efficacy of management techniques for creating quality NEC habitat.
This uncertainty addresses the issue of naturally self-sustaining shrub habitats and if they are productive NEC habitat. These habitats can consist of pitch-pine and scrub-oak barrens. This is important and an uncertainty that needs to be addressed because pitch pine and scrub-oak barrens are maintained as a fraction of the cost of creating other renewing habitats. Management actions that will help monitor the success of these habitats may include retrogressive vegetation management (through timber harvesting, chipping, or brontosaurs mowing), establishing shrublandsm(through seeding or transplanting), and converting invasive - to native – shrub dominated shrublands (through selective herbicide application, mowing, and planting)
2.Survival of NEC in augmented and reintroduced populations
The captive breeding and reintroduction programs are resource-intensive actions that may not always result in the increase of the targeted populations. Variations that can assist in the increase of growth rate of NEC populations are the use of hardening pens(outdoor breeding pens), soft release, predator control, reducing competition, supplementing nutrition, and the quality of habitat that individuals are released into. Individuals will be monitored after release by evaluating body condition, individual growth rates, reproduction, and survival by recapturing and pellet collections that will genetically tested.
3.Competition with the Eastern Cottontail
While the Eastern Cottontail may have some competitive advantages over NEC, not much more is known about their interaction in the wild. This could imply that by creating habitat for the NEC,Eastern Cottontail habitat is increased as well. To address this, the species abundance trends, response to management, and interactions between species will be assessed. This will be monitored through determining the distribution of the NEC and Eastern Cottontails across the NEC range and designing experiments that will reveal the response of both species to different population and habitat- management scenarios. 
4.Productivity of captive breeding
The basic life history of the NEC has already been extensively researchedhowever, the success of the NEC in captive breeding is unknown. The efficiency of this will depend on effective control of disease, high quality forage, successful mating, managing genetic of captive population, and survival of offspring. This will be monitored by examining captive populations to determine genetic and individual health and reproductive output. 
5.Landscape-scale response to the conservation effort
It is still unknown whether the habitat system created within each focus area with effectively support a functioning and persistent metapopulations. To monitor this, the NEC occupancy abundance in habitats across the species range will be evaluated. This may be done by assessing the quality and quantity of habitat available annually;percentage of patches occupied by NEC, rate of dispersal rate between patches, and trends in Eastern Cottontail abundance. 
6.Genetic monitoring and management of NEC populations
It is still unknown how the fragmentation of the NEC habitat will affect the species genetically. This will be monitored be managing wild and captiveNEC populations by capture and release to detect the loss of genetic variation. This can be detected and managed by minimizing reductions in effective population size,minimizing reductions in gene flow between populations, minimizing the loss of small populations, and maintaining normal environmental processes that create and maintain suitable habitat.

Another limiting factor of the project is the cooperation with landowners to manage the land. In order to have the required amount of NEC habitat, habitat creation and management must take place on 7,000 to 15,000 acres of privately owned land(Fuller and Tur 2012, section 4.3). This may be limiting because the public has the tendency toprotest actions such as clear cut and prescribed burn. It remains a challenge to explain to land owners how these actions can be an immense benefit for the local wildlife. 

Time also becomes a limiting factor when considering the amount of labor hours that are needed on the ground and in the field to create these habitats, impacting the cost of the overall project. In addition, site to site variation requires developing site-specific management plans. This is the most costly aspect of this strategy and can become a significant limiting factor when all funding has been identified yet.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Creating healthy young forest will not only benefit the wildlife it supports, it will also provide ecosystem services to people. Some of these benefits include increased revenue through wildlife supports, improved conditions for wildlife watching, and the generation of jobs to people who contribute to the project. About 39.6 million people took part in wildlife activities in 2016 according to the National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation. The expenditures of these outdoor recreations totaled 156.3 billion and this revenue is a large contributor to the nation’s economy and can only increase further by creating young forest.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: In addition, foresters and loggers are needed for every site that a habitat is being created on. This generates jobs for the local communities and allows the timber to be used as a reusable source. The timber that is cut can be used for house construction and making furniture, wood chips for biomass power generation, and firewood for heating homes. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: Furthermore it is a great way to create camaraderie for individual communities. About three quarters of shrubland and young forest are privately owned which requires effective communication between partners and local communities. Due to the large parcels of land needed for the creation of young forest, there can be resistance from the initial proposal. It is vital to be relatable to these communities and assist them in understanding how the creation of young forest will help sustain a variety of declining wildlife in addition to the NEC. Initiating in 2014, annual performance reports have been created for the implementation progress of the efforts on a yearly basis. A detailed list of all the recent information on continued uncertainties and suggestions in strategy adaptations that are broken down into each individual work group can be found in the New England Cottontail Regional Initiative 2016 Performance Report (Link attached in External Resources Section). As of the 2016 Performance report, a few of the key outstanding uncertainties are:

Funding to keep management and research effort moving forward.
Long-Term success with the captive breeding and restoration programs.
Resolving management uncertainties is ongoing, and is the subject of multiple research efforts; specifically, site-level population and vegetation responses need to be confirmed.
To date, the developing regional occupancy monitoring protocol has not adequately demonstrated power to detect long-term regional trends.
The approach to confirm a range-wide response is still being tested. Statistical consultation is underway to validate the occupancy monitoring protocol.
Captive survival of offspring and survival of released individuals remains low. Actions to increase the rate of survival will be discussed and implemented.

 
A few of the priority implementation directions for 2017 are (New England Cottontail Regional Initiative 2016 Performance Report):

Request State Land Management Teams conduct an annual review of the Focus Area Status Screening Templates (FASST forms) to document any changes in population estimates, habitat estimates, or ranking of each focus area in their state.
Continue to seek funding.
Continue to work closely with the Executive and Technical Committees and the various Work Groups to maintain focus.
Release rabbits into the large pens at Great Bay, NH to increase breeding program output.
Target key focus areas identified through status assessment for increased efforts to recruit landowners and inform the public about NEC conservation.
Seek assistance from the NEC Technical Committee’s Outreach Work Group and individual States to make NEC BMPs available to the public via Internet outlets and through education and outreach materials and efforts.
Allow State Land Management Teams to develop and implement state specific charges for their objectives.

  The long-term management for this project will be done through an adaptive management plan. Plans for this project have been assessed until the completion date of 2030. Habitat management during that time will be ongoing due to forest succession. The long-term recovery of the NEC may require more funding for habitat management and monitoring well into the future. This management strategy will depend on the success of the recovery of NEC and results from the monitoring objectives provided above. The seven phases of the adaptive management plan for this project are listed below. Each objective listed corresponds with a section of the conservation strategy.(Fuller, S. and A. Tur. 2017. Conservation Strategy for the New England Cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) pg.54-55).

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/buffelsdraai-reforestation-project-iqadi-south-africa/	South Africa: Buffelsdraai Reforestation Project, Iqadi	South Africa	2008-09	2025-12	"The Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project was established in 2008 by eThekwini Municipality’s Environmental Planning and Climate Protection Department. The aim was to alleviate climate change impacts associated with Durban hosting several 2010 FIFATM World Cup matches. A carbon footprint of 307 208 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) was declared for the event, and this reforestation project seeks to offset approximately 42 214 tonnes of carbon over a 20-year period.One highlight is the role that natural ecosystems play in supporting the livelihoods and resilience of local communities. The project encourages local people to grow indigenous tree seedlings which can be exchanged for food and other goods. Over 700 000 trees have been planted (January 2018).In 2011, the reforestation project was showcased as one of ten ‘Lighthouse Projects’ by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC) Momentum for Change Initiative. Christiana Figueres, then Executive Secretary, believes that this project demonstrates and exemplifies how local communities can best respond to climate change.The project was subsequently validated by the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance, and achieved a Gold Standard for ensuring exceptional climate change adaptation benefits as well as for benefits to local communities and biodiversity.Agriculture & Livestock The area was under sugarcane production for c. 100 years, within the 787-hectare buffer zone of the Buffelsdraai Regional Landfill Site. This resulted in severe loss of biodiversity on the site, including in drainage lines. In many areas, wetlands were drained and forest pushed back in order for additional sugarcane to be grown.
Sugarcane production also involved regular deposits of high nutrient fertilizers as well as pesticide and herbicides. Residues of these chemicals have likely remained on the site.
The sugarcane farms did create employment, but anecdotes indicate that labour were often brought from as far as Lesotho. These people were housed on the farms, and it seems that little employment was generated for people from local communities.
The loss of indigenous vegetation on the site, and in the area more broadly has had impacts on the availability of firewood and natural building materials, medicinal plants, and areas for grazing of livestock. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on contemporary reference sites or existing analogues of the pre-degradation ecosystem.The reference ecosystem (Kenneth Stainbank Nature Reserve) is located at a similar altitude, and distance from the ocean. Kenneth Stainbank Nature Reserve also contains a mix of Scarp forest, and Northern Coastal Forest as well as some fragmented grasslands
The Buffelsdraai site appears to have contained a mix of KwaZulu-Natal Hinterland Thornveld, KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld, Eastern Valley Bushveld, Scarp forest, and Northern Coastal Forest. Offset a portion of CO2 emissions (declared as 307,208 tons CO2 equivalent) associated with Durban’s hosting of several 2010 FIFA World CupTM soccer matches, through planting of trees.
Improve the biodiversity of the site, through forest restoration using locally indigenous species.
Deliver appropriate climate change adaptation measures, through improved ecosystem service delivery.
Deliver environmental education benefits to local communities.
Ensure job creation and skills development for local community members.

Monitoring Details: Periodic monitoring of biodiversity on the site, including trees, avifauna, invertebrates, and mammals.
A periodic Veld Condition Assessment (VCA) aids in the identification of areas to be prioritised for prescribed burns in a particular fire season. Start date, including baseline data collection: 2011 End Date: 2050
EThekwini Municipality (project owner, project design, oversight, funding and implementing)
National Department of Environmental Affairs (some funding)
DANIDA (some funding)
Wildlands Conservation Trust (implementation)
Local communities (planting of trees, control of invasive species etc.)

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: On-site fire management is undertaken to minimise the destruction of newly planted trees. Firebreaks are cut and maintained around all planted areas. This work is undertaken by the Municipality’s Fire and Invasive Species Control (FISC) programme, in conjunction with Wildlands, which provides manpower to directly suppress unauthorised wild fires. Fuel loads are reduced through the application of prescribed burns, as well as through continuous control of invasive alien plants (IAPs) on the site. Together, these minimise the occurrence of wildfires. Fire management  is largely seen as a protectionist activity, i.e. as a means to protect young trees, physical assets and people within the site. The risk of on-site methane (from the landfill footprint) contributing to fire-related disasters is accounted for by careful planning and management of, or reaction to, on-site fires.

Regular and ongoing control of invasive alien plants (IAPs) is a high priority, as these plants threaten the successful establishment of the forest. IAPs most commonly found on-site include Chromolaena odorata, Lantana camara, Melia azedarach, Solanum mauritianum and Tithonia diversifolia. Wildlands, as part of their planting regime, clear IAPs systematically prior to planting and also through follow-up control. IAPs pose a very high fire risk to the planted areas as they greatly increase biomass fuel loads; and this contributed to the decision to introduce a dedicated fire-control team from the FISC programme How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: Drained wetlands will be planted up in ways to encourage the functionality of the wetlands to return. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Use of a reference ecosystem to compare species lists and investigate ecosystem functionality How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Introduction of some species will be considered. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): It is anticipated that such functionality will improve over time How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Some corridors may be protected or added to the project site at a later date. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: Socio-economic benefits resulting from the reforestation project have been significant, and include more than 540 employment opportunities generated since the start the project in 2008. Benefits can be categorised into: a) household and b) community benefits (what can be termed multiplier effect). All people employed were from the surrounding communities and were previously unemployed. According to beneficiaries of the project, income gained from the project had significant impacts on their household livelihood. All permanent, temporary and part-time workers are paid wages at the national minimum wage level in the construction sector and beneficiaries have reported higher income than the average income of the whole community. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Good progress has been made in minimizing the primary ecosystem threats. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: Some wetlands on the site have recovered well, and others are in the process of recovering. Achieve a desirable species composition: Over 60 locally indigenous tree species have been planted. A variety of shrubs, herbs and climbers have also been planted. This in turn has helped improve bird and butterfly species that are being attracted to the site. Reinstate structural diversity: Management of different ecosystem types on the site is underway. Recover ecosystem functionality: Not yet assessed in full Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: Some corridors have been mapped out for inclusion in the broader open space system. It is anticipated that these corridors will assist in gene flow.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: A study of 320 tree-preneurs indicated that majority (97%) of people traded trees for food (Figure 3), followed by educational expenses such as school fees and stationary (16%) and bicycles (5%). A small number of people reported that they spent their wages on building materials bought locally, or on fees for driving lessons. A comparison of food security levels before and during the initiation of the project showed that people who reported that they “sometimes go hungry the whole day” were reduced from 80% to less than 50%. Furthermore, households that were acquiring food through trading trees increased to 30%. Evidence indicates that people became less reliant on begging for food from relatives and extended families.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: During the past year, the project has expanded its current scope, by assisting individuals and mentoring small businesses, so that trees can be traded on the open market. This will contribute to ongoing socio-economic development in the area, once the project is complete. The Indigenous Trees for Life (ITFL) initiative, as developed by Wildlands Conservation Trust, allows ‘Treepreneurs’ to grow seedlings at their homesteads and then trade these for credits. The credits can then either be swapped for groceries and other items at a nearby supermarket, used to pay for school fees or driving lessons, or to purchase building materials so that they can upgrade their homes. Discussions about further credit exchange options are ongoing, such as the possibility of trading trees for clothes. The project embraces the National Green Economy principles as a means to ensure a sustainable future for nearby communities. This model hopes to learn and then showcase how human well-being and social equity can be improved, while reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: To date 3,200 learners from 24 local schools, and 60 ward councillors and committee members (from Buffelsdraai, iNanda and Paradise Valley) attended training. Furthermore, 320 ordinary community members attended community site-guides training and environmental training. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: A key focus of the project was to restore the forest by also maximising benefits to local communities. Where possible, locals are employed for tasks such as digging holes and planting trees, fighting fires, and patrolling the site for undesirable activities. Research supported through the programme is not limited only to biodiversity and climate change aspects, as a number of postgraduate students have also undertaken studies focusing on community benefits, including knowledge transfer about climate change adaptation and socioeconomic development. The communities’ ongoing involvement aids in supporting, restoring and protecting local ecosystems, thereby providing them with improved ecosystem services. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: Some community members have claimed that they own land within the project site. However, they have not followed the formal land claims procedure. This has resulted in some tensions and challenges. On 16 July 2015 the ‘Buffelsdraai Landfill Footprint and Buffer zone Project’ won the “Best Public Service Implemented Programme or Project of the Year” from the KwaZulu-Natal Premier’s Service Excellence Awards (Douwes et al., 2015a).
The project has highlighted the importance of how natural ecosystems support and protect human communities, and the role that human communities can play in supporting, restoring and protecting local ecosystems. Apart from the subsistence contributions, forests support livelihoods through income earning opportunities. EThekwini Municipality, through its Environmental Planning and Climate Protection Department will undertake post-implementation maintenance and monitoring. "

North Shore Community Land Trust (NSCLT) in partnership with Turtle Bay Resort (TBR), US Fish and Wildlife’s (USFW) Coastal Program, Hawaiʻi Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR), and the community seek to advance conservation efforts at Kahuku Point. Kahuku Point is one of the few remaining coastal dune ecosystems on the northeast coast of Oʻahu that has not been significantly diminished by invasive plant and animals and recreational human activity.However, due to the introduction and spread of invasive plant and animal species and unguided recreational use in the past, restoration planning and efforts are needed to begin the process of ecosystem recovery, which will return the area to a more natural state. Goals to achieve this vision include the following:
Protect and preserve all cultural and natural resources
Install a predator-proof fence and traps to remove predatory, invasive animals on the makai side of the approximately 39-acre area
Continue plant restoration to facilitate increases in the population and abundance of native biota
Create suitable habitat for nesting and foraging seabirds including Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus), Red-footed Boobies (Sula sula), Laysan Albatrosss (Phoebastria immutabilis), and Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor) which frequent the area.
 Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Other The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Goals to achieve this vision include the following:

Protect and preserve all cultural and natural resources
Install a predator-proof fence and traps to remove predatory, invasive animals on the makai side of the approximately 39-acre area
Continue plant restoration efforts organized by NSCLT to facilitate increases the population and abundance of native biota
Create suitable habitat for nesting and foraging seabirds including Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus), Red-footed Boobies (Sula sula), Laysan Albatrosss (Phoebastria immutabilis), and Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor) which frequent the area.
Work closely with TBR and other partners to develop educational signage and defined trails that integrates with TBR’s proposed Comprehensive Cultural, Historic, and Natural Resources Management Plan (CP)

 
Implementation of this strategic plan will result in the protection and restoration of a large portion of the sand dune ecosystem for the benefit of residents, visitors and guests that frequent the area. Efforts to minimize human impacts on sand dunes, such as developing and designating pathways for visitors, will allow human visitation and ecosystem recovery to occur together. . Introduced mammalian predators such as cats, mongooses, rats, mice and dogs, will be excluded from the area by a predator-proof fence. This will allow seabirds, including the Laysan Albatross that is a frequent visitor) and plants (whose seeds are eaten by introduced rats and mice) to flourish. In addition to being a healthy coastal ecosystem for native biota, Kahuku Point is an ideal area for local community members and visitors to responsibly enjoy recreational activities such as fishing, hiking, and bird watching while also providing a place for traditional Hawaiian practices to continue in a space that is important to Native Hawaiian culture.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

In accordance with the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013, the U.S. Department of the Interior granted the state of Rhode Island $6,849,591 for projects to restore and improve coastal and estuarine resilience to storms. $1,400,000 was allocated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy to restore a parcel of saltmarsh within Narragansett’s John H. Chafee National Wildlife Refuge, along the Narrow River. The marsh had been suffering from extended periods of water inundation from sea level rise, as well as erosion from boat wakes, resulting in the die-off of lower marsh species and the shrinking of high marsh habitat. The goals of the restoration project are to increase the site’s resiliency to sea level rise by elevating the marsh by six to twelve inches, to improve fish and wildlife habitat, and to increase tidal flow of Pettaquamscutt cove, thereby improving water quality and river navigability for recreational boaters. Restoration work was officially completed in June 2017 and is currently being evaluated.Climate Change, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Degradation is largely due to sea level rise, and erosion from boat wakes. The low marsh was consistently waterlogged, suffocating the lower saltmarsh species. Within the Narrow River estuary scientists estimate that approximately twelve acres of saltmarsh has been lost due to sea level rise, and 39% of saltmarsh habitat is dominated by stressed vegetation and bare pans. The decline of the lower marsh species would eventually contribute to a cascade effect as wildlife habitat was lost. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on historical information about ecological attributes at the site prior to degradation.Aerial imagery from 1939 was used to determine historical acreage of pools and pans, and aerial imagery from 1939, and 1986 were used to identify drainage ditches, which were categorized as functioning and non-functioning. In addition, historical coastal survey maps from 1986 were used to identify historical salt marsh abundance and distribution.
The historic ecosystem was more complex. With a wider elevation range, the estuary was better able to support habitats at higher and lower elevations, providing a more diverse landscape. In the river, “deeper habitat areas” were able to support more fish, even with fewer eelgrass beds. The 1896 coastal survey maps showed 12 more acres of saltmarsh and 18% more salt marsh vegetation. There were also 40% fewer pools and pans. Many of the pools and pans from the historical ecosystem are still present. With deeper and more well-developed banks they are able to persist through the summer heat, supporting a higher density of fish, including mummichog, killifish, and stickleback compared to newer pools and pans. 
Historically, the channel was located in the middle of the river, and had clear secondary channels.
The restored estuary will have increased flushing of Pettaquamscutt Cove to improve water quality, deeper basins and channels that will support eelgrass habitat and serve as thermal refugia and corridors for fish, and will include more tidal flat habitat. The saltmarsh will have enhanced bank stability and drainage, increased elevation, and an expanded low marsh. A gradual slope to higher elevations will increase the site’s resiliency to sea level rise. Shallow pans and pools will be removed, leaving the deeper, and more ecologically functional pools and pans. The healthier marsh habitat will support the nesting and foraging of aquatic birds such as saltmarsh sparrows, egrets, and black ducks. Overall, the restoration should result in a more resilient, heterogeneous landscape that supports greater biodiversity.  The project’s ecological goals are to prevent and reduce habitat degradation, increase the site’s resiliency to sea level rise and climate change, increase ecological health by improving fish and wildlife habitat, and water quality.  Socioeconomic goals include enhancement of flood control and production of commercially important wildlife, and improvement of river navigability for recreational boaters.

Start date, including baseline data collection: Baseline data on habitat composition, elevation, and drainage were collected using aerial imagery and field surveys from 2011. Boat wake data was collected in 2008-2010, and shoreline stability data was collected in 2011-2012. Baseline data was supplemented with data from ongoing long-term water quality, fisheries, and nekton monitoring. End Date: Monitoring of fisheries, nekton, and water quality are ongoing. The monitoring of tidal flow and volumes, living shorelines, saltmarsh elevations, and low marsh creation will be culminated in 2019, while monitoring of degraded saltmarsh elevation capital, and marsh migration will end in 2020.
Primary stakeholders in the project include residents and recreational users of the Narrow River, as well as special interest groups such as the Narrow River Preservation Association, and river-dependent business owners. Restoration practitioners provided primary stakeholders with a 30-day review period of the draft environmental assessment, a public hearing, and invited stakeholders to participate in the restoration through plug planting. Communication with stakeholders was maintained throughout project implementation, and the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council provided timely updates on project status. Following project completion, restoration practitioners presented an overview of the project to the public.

How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: Material from the riverbed was excavated to deepen basins and the channel, as well as shift the channel back to its historical placement at the river’s center. A 1,300-foot tube attached to the dredge, transferred 24,000 yd3 of excavated material for thin-layer deposition. Overall, marsh height was increased by six to twelve inches, gradually increasing in elevation away from the shoreline. Shallow pools and pans were filled in with sediment, and runnels were formed in the marsh surface to enhance drainage. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: 35,000 local plugs of S. patens and S. alterniflora were planted with the help of 200 volunteers. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): Material was dredged from the Northeast and Southwest openings to Pettaquamscutt Cove to improve tidal flushing. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: In order to alert boaters to the shift in the channel, buoys were placed along the channel’s edge. 
Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: The deeper channel is safer for boaters, as there is less incidence of boats hitting bottom and damaging their propellers. During implementation of the project, restoration practitioners noted the value of working with SumCo Eco-Contracting, a full-service ecological contracting company based in New England that is specialized and highly-experienced in restoration work.  Long term monitoring will be necessary to track the marsh’s recovery so as to apply adaptive management as necessary. The new plantings will be monitored annually during the month of August. In addition, the groundwater will be tested every two months, and the net change in marsh elevation will be monitored yearly. USFWS will be responsible for the long-term management of the site. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/restoration-in-a-global-biodiversity-hotspot-in-western-australia/	Australia: Restoration in a global biodiversity hotspot in Western Australia	Australia	2010-01	2018-12	"The south-west of Western Australia is a global biodiversity hotspot where its high biodiversity suffers many threats. One of those threats is fragmentation of habitat owing to the large scale land clearing that was carried out in the 1950s and 1960s. This connectivity project aims to address this, and other threats, by restoring connections across a 70km swathe of farmland. Bush Heritage Australia has developed a Conservation Action Plan (using the Open Standards) in this area, where we are working to reconnect two large National Parks. The restoration of cleared farmland began with 60 hectares in 2003 and in 2018 a total of 2,500 hectares have been revegetated with varying levels of success. This project is focused on a 425-hectare restoration project on the Monjebup North property. The goal for this property was to reinstate as many species of native flora as possible, which in turn would provide habitat for the fauna known to inhabit the greater area. Plants were reinstated using both direct seeding and hand planting of seedlings over 4 years. Monitoring since 2012 has found that habitat structure is developing and many species of fauna have returned to the once cleared farmland.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation The land was cleared of most of its native vegetation during the 1970s and 1980s, which was supported and encouraged by the State government of the time. The plant communities that were cleared included mallee heath and yate woodland. The land was  growing cereal crops and sheep until 2012, which resulted in a severe loss of biodiversity, soil compaction, erosion and degradation of the soil profile as well as fragmentation of habitat between a large nature reserve and undisturbed bush land. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).The key attributes of the reference ecosystem used to evaluate restoration success included vegetation structure and cover, floristic diversity, soil attributes, bird activity and vertebrate fauna species richness. The reference system occurred adjacent to the restoration site and correlations were drawn between soil types and topography of the sites to enable 13 different vegetation systems to be identified for restoration on the property. The project’s primary goals are to reinstate as many species of native flora as possible, which in turn will provide habitat for the fauna known to inhabit the greater area with the ultimate aim of reconnecting existing native bush land.

Monitoring Details: Bush Heritage Australia is committed to long term monitoring of all the properties it manages across Australia. Monjebup is no exception and local staff are responsible for carrying out the monitoring, analysing the results and providing adaptive management. The Conservation Action Plan (developed using the Open Standards for Conservation) uses 8 indicators to monitor the success or otherwise of restoration on all properties, these are:

1. Extent of mallee heath community - Number of hectares restored 
2. Plant genera establishment - Number of plant genera in restored areas/year
3. Stem density - Mean number of stems/hectare over all restoration monitoring sites/year
4. Presence of ground dwelling fauna - Species richness of ground dwelling fauna at restored and reference sites
5. Bird activity and species richness - Index of bird activity and species richness at restored and reference sites
6. Bat activity - Index of bat activity at restored and reference sites
7. Extent of wallaby habitat restored - Hectares of wallaby habitat restored based on wallaby monitoring 
8. Presence/absence of wallabies at restored sites - Camera trap rate of wallabies at restored sites

Monitoring of birds and other vertebrate fauna was carried out prior to revegetation of the property. This has been continued each year since 2012 and will continue annually into the future.  Monitoring of germination and survivorship of direct seeding and seedling planting is carried out a few months after planting and then  again annually. Artificial nest boxes for small marsupials have been installed and are monitored annually.  Aerial drone monitoring has been trialled at the site. Start date, including baseline data collection: 2011 End Date: Will keep monitoring into the future as long as resources allow.
The primary stakeholders in the project are local landholders, local government authorities, other conservation NGOs and Bush Heritage supporters. They were involved in the initial development of the Conservation Action Plan for the area and provided guidance for choosing the conservation targets, indicators and attributes of each target and monitoring methods. They are kept informed through newsletters, social media, Bush Heritage website and open days on the reserve.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: All cropping and grazing activities were phased out after acquisition of the property between 2012 and 2014. The previous property owner was granted a lease over the cleared land and continued cropping and grazing up until a few months prior to direct seeding activities. The last crop over the final 100 hectares was harvested in late 2013. The continuation of cropping and grazing was essential on this property to allow any residual fertiliser to be taken out of the system prior to direct seeding (phosphorous in particular is toxic to many of our native plants). A further factor was weed control which, if not carried out, would allow weeds to become established thus making pre-seeding control more difficult and expensive.  No further inputs of pesticide, fertiliser or soil disturbance  occurred on this property after 2014.  Herbicide was used when necessary to increase the survivorship of native germinants prior to planting during 2014-2018. No further herbicide use will be necessary after the end of 2018. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: The process of direct seeding includes the formation of furrows that are created along contours to assist in water infiltration,  or where water is used where it falls instead of running off. The site is reasonably level and the contour furrows are effective at preventing high energy run-off in high rain fall events, which occur regularly in this area. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Planning for the restoration of the cleared land included an analysis of the soil, plant and fauna species of the reference sites. A restoration plan was prepared which included 13 vegetation systems on relevant soil types.  Seed from around 150 native plant species was sown across the cleared area, which included species from each strata, species to provide a nectar supply year round, short-lived leguminous species to provide nitrogen fixing and coarse woody debris. Further hand planting of nodes of Proteaceous species has been carried out to enhance the availability of  nectar for those fauna dependent on it. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): Plant species representing all strata were included in the seed mix although the species included for the ground layer was much less diverse than the reference sites. The Restionaceae and Cyperaceae families, or 'sedges'  are particularly challenging to reintroduce to our disturbed landscapes as are some of the geophytes and forbes.  A special effort was made during this project to reinstate microhabitat for fauna.  Coarse woody debris and rocks have been re-distributed to provide shelter to invertebrates (including termites),  small marsupials, native rodents,  reptiles and frogs and for foraging habitat for birds. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Leguminous plant species were included to fix nitrogen in the depleted soils. Plants were also chosen to provide nesting material and habitat for birds and other vertebrates. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): This project is based on the assumption that by physically reconnecting two large reserves of undisturbed native vegetation gene flow will be reestablished between plant and animal populations; nomadic and dispersal limited species will benefit and hydrology will return to pre-clearing regimes. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: Bush Heritage engaged local contractors for tasks including weed control, site preparation, seed collecting, seedling supply, direct seeding operation, feral animal control and herbivore control. This policy ensures that the local community gains a benefit from the land being taken out of production and into conservation. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The threat of cropping and grazing has been eliminated from this property. The threat of fragmentation has been addressed by restoring native vegetation between two large areas of undisturbed native bush land. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: Since the cessation of farming the soil has been stabilised and is no longer subject to wind or water erosion, impaction or other disturbance from farming practices.  The reinstated perennial vegetation system further protects the soil from erosion by providing soil binding roots, leaf litter and 
 protecting cryptogamic crusts. Achieve a desirable species composition: Results of monitoring has found that approximately 25% of reference site plant species occur in the restoration. This is a good result for this part of the world given the high plant diversity present in the reference sites and the paucity of knowledge on techniques needed to reinstate a majority of the species. The vertebrate fauna results are higher with around 68% of species known from the reference sites occurring in the restored sites. Feral predators are still present and research is ongoing regarding integrated feral predator control in fragmented landscapes on the south coast of Western Australia. Reinstate structural diversity: All strata are present, although the ground layer is less diverse in species than the reference sites. Habitat diversity is high with the provision of areas of native grasses, sparsely vegetated areas, dense thickets and nodes of Proteaceous plants for the wide variety of nectar feeding honeyeater birds and mammal pollinators that occur in the area. Recover ecosystem functionality: There is evidence of high productivity of the restored areas, particularly for some birds. The results of monitoring show that there is higher bird activity for some of the functional groups i.e. nectivorous resource nomads, when compared to the reference sites. The fast growing vegetation is providing a higher lever of resources at present than the older and, sometimes, senescent reference sites.  Reproduction is occurring in the restored sites as evidenced by birds nesting, young marsupials in nest boxes, a high level invertebrate activity, flowering and seeding plants and recruitment of young plants. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: The evidence for gene flow has not been established yet for this project. Research is being carried out currently on the genetics of five plants species with the aim of improving planning of future restoration activities and the adaptive management of already established restoration sites by addressing a significant knowledge gap in the field of restoration ecology; that of how ecological and genetic viability of restored plant populations is affected by different establishment regimes and over time. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The presence of feral predators, such as the European Red Fox and Feral Cat are quite likely limiting the re-colonisation by some native fauna  species.  There has been some plant death that has been attributed to either dry summer condition or wet winter condition.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The project has contributed in a small way to the livelihoods of those in the local community who have been engaged to control weeds, herbivores and feral predators, to conduct site preparation, seed collecting and direct seeding programmes.
The key lessons learned by this project include:

Plantings that are too dense don’t thrive,
We have a lot more to learn about propagation, germination and seed treatment of our Australian  native plant species, and
Our native fauna responds quickly to the provision of suitable habitat.

Our monitoring shows that plantings that achieve over 15,000 stems per hectare don’t thrive as well as those that establish at a lower stem density. An exact stem density is difficult to achieve as germination is dependent on many factors and revegetation specialists can overcompensate for possible vagaries in weather. Dense germination results in high competition for soil moisture and light, it appears to also favour a high incidence of insect attack and disease. We are working with our contract revegetation specialists to ensure a results of <15,000 and >3,000 stems per hectare for future restoration projects.
Of the 590 plant species known to occur on the property only around 150 species were included in the restoration owing to a lack of knowledge of how to collect and treat their seed, germinate and/or propagate them. More research is required in this area to enable us to include a higher number of species in our restoration. A priority knowledge gap where research effort is being sought is the re-establishment of Restinaceae and Cyperceae species.
Australian native fauna have returned to the restored area sooner than predicted and we now need to examine in further detail the habitat requirements that are being exploited by each species and how we can improve or duplicate this in different vegetation systems. The results from monitoring all the indicators are stored in Miradi software and are used to track progress and to provide adaptive management recommendations, i.e. fine-leaved eucalypts should be incorporated into all restoration for the use of pygmy possums for nesting material.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/maidford-river-saltmarsh-restoration-middletown-rhode-island-usa/	USA: Maidford River Saltmarsh Restoration: Middletown, Rhode Island	United States of America	2015-05	2019-05	"Saltmarshes are arguably one of the most productive ecosystems on the planet, as these areas provide nurseries for birds, invertebrates and a diversity of fish species. Almost 70% of commercially fished species in Rhode Island rely on saltmarshes for at least a portion of their lives.9 Marshes have a natural ability to both vertically and horizontally accrete over time by collecting sediments, minerals and plant matter.10 Unfortunately, sea levels are rising faster than marshes can accrete. Saltmarshes are becoming flooded more frequently and for longer periods of time. This has degraded many of these essential ecosystems around the world.The Sachuest Point Wildlife Refuge in Middletown, Rhode Island spans 247 acres and provides the public with a visitor’s center, hiking trails and scenic overlooks. The Maidford River Saltmarsh accounts for 11 acres of the refuge’s 47 acres of marshlands.5. The marsh suffered dramatically as a result of sea level rise and powerful storm surges, with significant degradation occurring during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The restoration was fortunate to receive funding under the Disaster Relief Appropriation Act of 2013 which was enacted to fund restorations relating to damages caused the storm.Climate Change The primary cause of degradation of the Maidford Marsh is sea level rise caused by climate change. Strong storm surges during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 devastated an already struggling ecosystem. During the storm, the marsh became heavily eroded and flow channels became blocked causing the marsh to flood more frequently and for longer time periods, especially during rain events which decreased the marshes salinity. This flooding drove out marsh fish, attracted mosquitos, diminished native grass populations and allowed for invasion by Phragmites australis. Secondary sources of degradation include water pollution from stagnant pools and nearby roads. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Saltmarshes serve a vital role in Narragansett Bay, providing habitat, nourishment and nursery for terrestrial and aquatic species. They also provide a buffer for upland areas against the winds and waves of storms8 and when functioning properly can filter metals and toxins from the water. Originally, the Maidford Marsh was comprised of a mixture of native high and low marsh plants such as Spartina aterniflora, S. patens, Distichlis spicata, and Juncus gerardii. The high marsh grasses at Maidford Marsh had supported nesting populations of the salt marsh sparrow and the marsh as a whole was able to host a variety of migratory birds before degradation.
It is important to note that the Maidford Marsh has not always flowed into the Sakonnet River. Originally, the marsh flowed into Sachuest Bay and was diverted to the Sakonnet River in the 1880’s for construction work.3 This means that the marsh channel is completely manmade. There are currently no plans to redirect the marsh channel back to its original direction because of existing roads. The main goal of the Maidford Marsh restoration was to improve its resiliency against sea level rise and strong storm surges. Raising the marsh height by thin layer deposition has a cascade of positive effects. Because the marsh was too low to drain at low tide, particularly after heavy rain events, increasing its height improved habitat for native marsh grasses and restored salinity to exclude invasive P. australis. The return of native marsh grasses will restore necessary nesting habitat for the endangered saltmarsh sparrow. In restoring the flow, the marsh will be less susceptible to flooding and formation of stagnant pools. This will improve overall water quality and eliminate habitat for breeding mosquitos.

Monitoring Details: Monitoring planned once project is completed includes: water quality monitoring (before, during and after storm events), salinity measurements, tracking marsh accretion, vegetation abundance and community mapping, nekton surveys and invasive control.1 Monitoring has not yet begun.
Middletown residents were the primary stakeholders in the Maidford Marsh restoration. Much of their drinking water is provided by the Maidford River.14 Poor water quality also caused beach closures due to the outlet of the Maidford River channel draining bacteria-ridden water into the Sakonnet River at Third Beach. This would surely upset any patron trying to get to the beach to cool off with a swim during hot and humid summer days.

Description of Project Activities: The first segment of the marsh restoration involved a thin layer deposition that added sediment to the top layer of the marsh. This action mimics the marshes natural ability to elevate gradually over time. Sea levels are currently rising almost twice as fast as marsh accretion rates.5 The addition of sediments to the marsh makes up for lost accretion time and gives the ecosystem a chance for success as sea levels continue to rise. Sediment addition ranged from one inch to one foot depending on location with a total of 11,000 cubic yards of sediment added.7 (EAC: 1,2,4)

Once the thin layer deposition was performed, flow and drainage was restored by digging out existing channels and creating shallow channels, called “runnels”. This restoration of natural flow is expected to aid in the marshes ability to properly flood and drain during tidal events. This will also eliminate the formation stagnant pools that previously formed after storms. Freshwater flows were diverted to improve the marshes salinity, thus removing habitat for breeding mosquitos and recreating habitat for native fish.1 (EAC: 2, 3, 5, 6) 

Invasive species management was another important part of the restoration. Phragmites had heavily encroached on the high marsh, replacing native grasses and impeding proper drainage. Phragmites control involved the licensed application of the pesticide glyphosate. Glyphosate was applied to Phragmites in the late summer months when the plants were in full bloom.1 2-4 weeks after glyphosate application, Phragmites was mowed to remove dead matter and reduce shade to allow for native grass reestablishment.1 (EAC: 1,3,5)

Native grasses plugs were planted after the deposition in the high and low marsh areas between April and June of 2016.1 S. alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) plugs were planted in areas that experience daily submersion. “Smooth cordgrass is an effective soil stabilizer used on interior tidal mudflats, dredge-fill sites, and other areas of loose and unconsolidated soils associated with marsh restoration.”13 The smooth cordgrass should reduce the erosion rate due to tidal flux. It is estimated that about 22,000 grass plugs of various native species were planted.6 Plugs were planted with the help of local volunteers from Save The Bay, employees from a local CVS Pharmacy, high school students, and many others.6 (EAC: 2,3,4) 
Achieve a desirable species composition: Although the restoration is still in progress and has not yet been monitored, it appears that many goals of the project have been achieved. The high marsh is flooding less and the marsh in its entirety drains more easily than before (EAC: 2). Water quality has benefited due to the improvement of drainage. Areas that previously hosted mosquito larvae now appear to be hosting fish populations3 (EAC: 3). The grass plugs planted have thrived in the absence of Phragmites, which will reintroduce nesting habitat for the salt marsh sparrow and maintain the stability of the marsh (EAC: 3,5,6). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Although the marshes functions have been vastly improved, the mouth of the river channel continues to be blocked by sand despite restorationists best efforts to resolve the issue. The thought is that because the river channel is manmade and was created in a beach area, the channel has a natural tendency to be sandy.3 This causes the mouth of the channel to frequently become blocked. The US Fish and Wildlife service is currently working on a plan to resolve this issue with their restoration partners.3

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Restoration of the Maidford Marsh has improved water quality, removed breeding habitat for mosquitoes and in turn has benefited human safety. West Nile Virus and Eastern Equine Encephalitis have become more prevalent in Rhode Island in recent years.1 Eliminating these mosquito breeding areas has lowered their total production, sequentially decreasing potential for infection.

In previous years, pollution from the marsh resulted in closures at Third Beach. Stagnant water from flooding and lack of proper drainage gave mosquitos an ideal breeding location. Flushing the existing marsh channels and increasing ditches to allow salt water to flow more freely eliminated this issue.2
The restoration displayed a positive response from both terrestrial and aquatic species. Fish and invertebrates seemed to be the first to respond, as they were able to take advantage of improved conditions quickly.12 Marsh plants are slower to respond, but seem to be progressing on the trajectory of an undisturbed marsh site, although it may be decades before the marsh vegetation becomes fully established.12 Monitoring planned once project is completed includes: water quality monitoring (before and after storm events), salinity measurements, tracking marsh accretion, vegetation abundance and community mapping, nekton surveys and invasive control.1 "

Within 1600 acres of the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve is Drakes Island tidal marsh. Presently, a road runs through the marsh leading to houses comprising a small community and Drakes Island Beach. Due to development in the area and the historical restrictions of the road and culvert originally installed in 1848, the marsh’s health greatly deteriorated. Vegetation composition, surface elevation, water levels and wildlife were all negatively impacted. In an effort to restore these aspects and reduce the impacts to the surrounding community (i.e. flooding), NOAA, the Town of Wells, the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve and multiple other partners sought to install a less restrictive culvert to increase the tidal flow into the marsh. Monitoring efforts post restoration each year from 2005 up until present day revealed that several issues are still associated with the project including irregular flooding events. As a result, the final restoration status of the marsh is under debate.Agriculture & Livestock, Dams & Hydrology, Fragmentation, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry 1848 is the year noted for the initial restriction of the marsh due to the creation of a dike directly across the marsh. A road built on top of the dike and the placement of a box culvert underneath the road followed about 70 years after which further diminished the marsh quality. Also during the mid-1800’s, the marsh was drained and converted to hay fields and a pasture for livestock, a much too common occurrence back then that led to drastic losses of wetlands throughout New England. This caused a cascade of detrimental effects including reduced salt water inflow, little to no tidal exchange due to the greatly undersized culvert, and tidal flooding reduced to a maximum of about one foot across the marsh. Up until 1988 when the initial box culvert installed in the 1950’s broke, the marsh was nearly converted to a freshwater and brackish ecosystem. Although tidal flow was lowered, flooding was more prominent towards the houses near the marsh, especially during spring tide events, as the water did not exit the marsh quickly enough. Decreased tidal flow also reduced the influx of sediment into the marsh. The coupling of lower tidal flow and influx of sediment eventually led to soils oxidizing at a higher rate, ultimately leading to subsidence of the marsh.
The culvert is also a hindrance to biotic aspects of the system as it limits movement of fish and other estuarine animals into and out of the marsh. One major effect that occurred due to decreased tidal exchange is lowered salinity levels and subsidence of the marsh overall, which allowed the common invasive reed (Phragmites australis) to establish and the native cattail Typha latifolia to spread. The invasion further led to unsuitable habitat and lower abundances of native fish and nekton such as the mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) that were previously abundant The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).The marsh on the west side of the impoundment (Drakes Island Road) was used as a pre-disturbance reference for restoration measures. This marsh, is directly downstream of the impacted marsh of Drakes Island and connects to the Webhannet River. Species composition, water levels, and species densities, as well as abundances, are all included as a basis for restoration of the impacted marsh. The reference marsh was composed of primarily high marsh habitat with creek channels and pools in a mosaic throughout the area. Sedimentary records were also examined along with assessing the reference marsh to infer the impacted marsh was several feet higher than pre-disturbance. 
Improve tidal flow to establish previous salinity levels and natural tidal patterns in the marsh to limit spread of Phragmites australis.
To increase high marsh habitat and increase population of Spartina patens. Flow will be increased but high tidal flow will be limited.
Manage water levels for nesting areas of Saltmarsh sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus)
Subsequently improve habitat for native fish and nekton communities
Reduce flooding in surrounding developed areas


Monitoring Details: Two years before any decisions were made, several studies were conducted on the marsh to assess its status and composition. Stakeholder opinions were taken into account along with hypothetical modeling of different scenarios on actions to take for the marsh. The best model to benefit all equally was based on the idea to reinstall a less restrictive culvert and self-regulating tide gate (SRT). Monitoring efforts were also conducted immediately before the installation and after the installation for the following two years. 

The Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge led the monitoring using wildlife (including nekton and the salt marsh sparrow), vegetation composition, and hydrologic characteristics such as groundwater levels and salinity as the main ecosystems attributes to measure success.

 Monitoring is still ongoing yearly with efforts focusing primarily during the growing season. Start date, including baseline data collection: Three years prior to initial start date. End Date: Ongoing
The Town of Wells, Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge, The Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve, and the community of residents that reside on Drakes Island were all the primary stakeholders in the project. All major stakeholders were involved in the project from the start and communication through meetings, press releases, and general news circulation was administered throughout the project’s time line. The opinions of all people working on the project were included in the creation of management and monitoring plans, especially those of the community residents. In particular the views of the residents led the maintenance decisions post construction of the new culvert and tide gate. 
 

Description of Project Activities: Restoration began with the removal of the old culvert, which measured approximately 0.9 meters in width, underneath Drakes Island Road and the installation of a new 1.5 by 1.2 meter box culvert. As well as the new culvert a self-regulating tide gate (SRT) was also implemented on the southern side of the road along with flashboards on the northern side to be able to physically manage the water levels coming into and out of the marsh. The size of the culvert was an important decision as these measurements would only allow for a partial restoration but not a full restoration. How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: The new culvert would potentially allow more tidal flow into the marsh, increasing the salinity overall and thus hopefully causing the die back of Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: A less restrictive culvert would reinstate a more natural tidal regime into the marsh and so restore the hydrology that has been previously disrupted. The restoration of a natural regime would also hopefully raise the level of the marsh by increasing inundation periods which would eventually cause the soils to change back to anaerobic conditions and reduce subsidence and decomposition of the vegetation. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Construction of an SRT and wider culvert would be expected to alter the species composition to a more salt-tolerant and high marsh composition similar to that of the reference marsh downstream. Species found in this area include Spartina alterniflora, Plantago maritima, Distichlis spicata, and Limonioum carolinianum. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): N/A How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): Low lying pools within the marsh will become more accessible during tidal events where water level is higher, reducing discontinuity of nekton use throughout the marsh. Cycling of nutrients from the downstream marsh and estuary should also be improved from an increase in tidal flow. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): A new culvert will reestablish the flow that has been constrained by the impoundment of Drake Island Road between the impacted marsh and the downstream marsh as well as flow to the Webhannet estuary nearby. With the culvert being the only primary passage into the upstream marsh, wildlife passage will also be improved. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: The self-regulating tide gate and flashboards installed would allow adjustments of water into and out of the marsh. This approach will allow accommodation for community members and town officials to control the water to desirable outcomes. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia continue to persist in the marsh post construction. Tidal levels were not increased enough in the first year after the new culvert was installed and so led to drier conditions across the marsh and some spread of the invasives. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: Groundwater levels eventually increased up to 14.4 cm below the surface in the last few years of noted monitoring which was higher than the reference marsh. Pool levels and their salinity levels remained much lower and failed to reach management goals. Total flow levels were recorded as 13 centimeters lower than the set goal in the management plan and because of this do not reach areas of the marsh that would provide sufficient flooding to maintain a salt marsh habitat. Achieve a desirable species composition: The second year of monitoring showed a positive increase in growth of high marsh plant species, yet, tidal flow was still restricted enough to allow expansion of Phragmites due to the lowered salinities throughout the marsh. Composition of nekton and fish species varied slightly from the reference marsh but it was significantly observed that the densities of species and abundancies were much lower in the impacted marsh. Salt marsh sparrow numbers were also seen to decrease yearly since pre-construction and still remain lower than in the reference marsh. Reinstate structural diversity: In the first year post construction, pools throughout the marsh resembled those of the downstream marsh in habitat complexity more than before. This did not last long and the most current monitoring concludes that structure of the reference and impacted marsh are not uniform in comparison. Recover ecosystem functionality: The result of lower tidal flooding caused many of the pools to lose functionality as numerous pools dried up completely and others were diminished in size. One major negative consequence of this was the lowered fish and nekton utilization of these pools. Even though it was not focused on in monitoring efforts, nutrient flow in and out of the marsh is assumed to be hindered. Fish and nekton are important components in nutrient cycling and decomposition of matter in a salt marsh. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: The wider culvert allows better passage for fish and nekton communities into and out of the marsh but the hydrology is still inhibited. Although wildlife use is being observed, longer term trends of use and residency in the marsh will have to be recorded to make a better determination of the functionality of the restored marsh. Especially during spring and neap tide events, water is being held upstream of the impoundment and causing longer inundation periods than usual. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Even though a new larger culvert and regulating tide gate was installed, the water flow is still somewhat restricted based on recent research. Due to the tide gate being improperly installed at the wrong elevation, poor drainage is an issue in the marsh and water is being held for extended periods within the marsh. The present state of the marsh is considered low marsh due to the dominance of S. alterniflora compared to the reference high marsh downstream. Along with varied zonation across the marsh, this outcome was not intended for one of the project goals. 

Public opinion of residents on Drakes Island and the stakeholders were in opposition to fully restore historical tidal regimes to the marsh due to the likely possibility of people’s homes being flooded.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: While not officially stated, opinions from stakeholders have suggested an increase in recreational benefits in the marsh such as kayaking and fishing, as well as positive change in overall appearance of the marsh. Flooding of houses has generally decreased due to continual adjustments of the culvert. The project has been also seen to reduce the risk of flooding and damage during storm events of Drakes Island Road itself.
Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: A  consensus from the community is still in question as to whether the project was a success. Concerns are still being voiced to make further adjustments to the culvert and tidal levels but they contradict with the ecological outcome of the marsh. The Drakes Island Marsh restoration project demonstrated the importance of cooperative actions and views of all present stakeholders. Ecological and community driven goals conflicted with each other to a degree in this project. While all goals couldn’t be completely accomplished, both sides suffered drawbacks. For example, the marsh has lower tidal levels in pools than the established goal and the community’s concern about high tide levels during spring and neap tides. Compromising proved to be a solution in this project to reach the majority of goals. 
Research and monitoring allow a quantitative assessment for the state of the restoration and will eventually provide information on how to better manage the system. Yet, because of the extended time it takes to conduct monitoring and research efforts, knowing which actions to take and when to take them was not immediately apparent. Many responses to adjustments (in this case from the SRT) such as vegetative composition, would not be substantially seen in the marsh for weeks to months at a time and perhaps longer. This conflicted with the communities and Town’s reasoning to make adjustments faster than the ecosystem would respond. It is greatly important to have concrete goals in mind at the start of a project and even more importantly to follow those goals until an outcome is achieved.
  Long-term maintenance of the Drakes Island Marsh ecosystem so far is based around the self-regulating tide gate and succeeding adjustments to it and the accompanying flashboards. No other active management methods are in place for the marsh but continuing monitoring of salinity, surface, and groundwater levels are being done annually. Wildlife and vegetative surveys are also done throughout the year by members and volunteers of the Rachel Carson Wildlife Refuge. The Wells Estuarine Reserve is also aiding in the long term monitoring while the Town of Wells and its Technical Advisory Committee are responsible for maintenance of the tide gate.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/tidmarsh-farms-restoration-project-plymouth-massachusetts/	USA: Tidmarsh Farms Restoration Project, Plymouth, Massachusetts	United States of America	2010	2016	"Prior to restoration activities, Tidmarsh Farms was a commercial cranberry farm in Plymouth Massachusetts.  In 2010, approximately 200-acres of farmland was taken out of production on the east side of the property (Tidmarsh East) and placed under a conservation easement through the USDA NRCS Wetland Reserve Program. The owners, with the help of the Massachusetts Department of Ecological Restoration and other partners, completed assessment, design, and implementation phases over the next six years. The goal was to transform the site into self-sustaining freshwater wetlands and stream network through a “process-based” approach focusing on the movement and storage of water on the land. Restoration actions completed in 2016 included dam removals, stream reconstruction, ditch plugging, planting, and wood installations. Beaver Dam Brook is now open from its headwaters to Cape Cod Bay for the first time in over a century. Native plants and wildlife are returning to the site. The progress of this restoration will be monitored for decades by Living Observatory, a learning collaborative formed in parallel with the restoration project. Tidmarsh East was purchased by Mass Audubon and opened as a wildlife sanctuary in 2017, providing recreational and educational opportunities to the community. The western side of the farm was purchased by the Town of Plymouth and restoration is scheduled for 2019.Agriculture & Livestock, Dams & Hydrology The land was purchased by the Manomet Cranberry Company in the 1890s, and has been used for agricultural production since then. Over the more than 100 years of cranberry farming on site, Beaver Dam Brook was altered by damming, ditching, and straightening. The former wetland surface was also altered significantly. After removal of native vegetation and grading to establish the original cranberry beds, a thin layer of sand was added every few years. After over a century of this common industry practice, several feet of compacted sand had accumulated over the native peat soils. The sand “fill” led to the separation of the ground surface from the water table, causing a gradual transition away from wetland plant communities. These combined practices led to significantly degraded wetland conditions on site, and these legacy impacts were targeted by the restoration project for active intervention to re-establish wetland hydrology on site. Additional impacts came from farming practices such as the use of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and management for mono-culture. Upon cessation of farming in 2010, these practices came to an immediate end. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).This project focused on removing stressors and restoring processes that will create and maintain a self-sustaining wetland ecosystem. Although there was not a specific target wetland community in mind, the team gathered historical evidence and concluded that some form of forested swamp with deep kettle hole peat deposits was previously present.  With an overarching goal of restoring hydrology that would support a self-sustaining wetland in the future, the project team did not hold any one vision of wetland development in mind. This gives the site flexibility to naturally heal over time, and be dynamic in response to future change. As project manager, Alex Hackman, stated, “The initial outcome is not the final product, but the beginning of the restoration trajectory”.
Historical maps show Beaver Dam Brook as a meandering freshwater stream that flowed northerly, to Bartlett Pond and emptied into Cape Cod Bay prior to the 1890s. This stream was important for the dispersal of wildlife, organic matter, and sediments. There are historical records documenting that Beaver Dam Brook and Fresh Pond (a natural 68-acre kettle pond on the site) formerly supported an anadromous fish run. The project already succeeded in restoring connectivity in the Beaver Dam Brook watershed. It has been returned to its original meandering path from its headwaters to Cape Cod Bay. Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), American eel (Anguilla rostrata) and blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis) have already been observed moving through the waterway.
Tree stumps and peat layers found in portions of the site, along with historic documents, suggest that sections of the site were once forested swamp. The downstream area of the current project site is mature red maple (Acer rubrum) swamp, an ecosystem common in headwater streams like Beaver Dam Brook, that are fed by springs or seeps. These swamps are usually dominated by red maple, but include other tree species, such as Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides). Their dense shrub and herb layers provide important habitat for wildlife, such as understory birds and small mammals. Seasonal flooding provides breeding habitat for amphibians, and resting areas for migrating waterfowl. Forested wetlands provide many services such as flood protection, water purification, and groundwater recharge.
The Massachusetts NHESP mapped two areas of the project site as priority habitats for the Eastern Box Turtle (Terrapene carolina), a Massachusetts Species of Special Concern. The site is surrounded by forested uplands to the west and south, creating a buffer of 80 to 1,500 feet. This buffer is primarily composed of Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), pitch pine (Pinus rigida), and oak (Quercus) species, and provides an important method of dispersal for wetland dependent species, such as turtles and amphibians. Actions that eliminated the steep and artificial transitions between the wetlands and uplands will facilitate the movement of these species. This project sought to holistically restore an approximately 200-acre site from retired, degraded cranberry bogs to self-sustaining, high quality, freshwater wetlands and a cool-water stream network. This process based approach focused on removing limiting factors and regaining ecosystem function.
The primary objectives of the project were:

to encourage the development of a self-sustaining, complex, productive, and dynamic (resilient) system of high-quality streams and native wetlands;
to establish a refuge for diverse native plant and animal communities, including a restored herring run;
to enhance connectivity, expand biological diversity, and promote conditions for self-sustaining wetland communities; and,
to increase the connection between people and the land by providing a beautiful, protected area for public use and enjoyment.


Monitoring Details: The Living Observatory plans to document the property’s recovery for 20 years or more. Start date, including baseline data collection: 2010 End Date: 2030 or longer
The landowners are extremely involved, as they initiated the project. They were involved in planning, implementation, and monitoring. One of the owners started Living Observatory, a learning collaborative formed in parallel with the restoration project, to monitor the progress of the restoration for decades to come. Although this was private land, the neighborhood had become adjusted to public uses, such as recreation, over many decades. Concerns about construction period impacts were raised. Several well-attended public meetings were held, and the project was closely followed in the local press.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: When this site was taken out of production in 2010, many of the stressors caused by farming were eliminated such as the use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers, management for mono-culture, and active sanding of the bog surface.  The project itself addressed the legacy impacts of agriculture that would have otherwise presented an on-going threat to wetland hydrology. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: The project focused on re-naturalizing the movement and storage of water on the land, with an expectation that other physical processes would also be repaired (e.g. the movement and storage of sediment, organic matter, and organisms).  Removal of the sand layer on site was not feasible, so a number of actions were implemented to help elevate the water table and increase soil moisture including: 
•Filling perimeter irrigation ditches 
•Plugging interior (lateral) irrigation ditches
•Reconstructing a sinuous stream channel with large wood (increasing hydrological residence time)
•Using two in-stream features (essentially constructed riffles) to slightly elevate upstream water elevations
•Mechanically breaking apart the dense cranberry mat to encourage the expression of springs on the restored wetland surface How this project achieved a desirable species composition: •Activation of native seed bank across the bog surface 
•Supplemental planting to increase diversity (i.e., Atlantic white cedar trees, red maple, fen, grassland, transitional)
•Restore processes that drive formation of diverse plant communities
•Invasive species management How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): •Reconstructing main channel and tributaries
•Addition of large wood to channels and bog surfaces 
•Creation of microtopography on bog surface How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): All of the above How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): •Removal of dams to return drained impoundments to free-flowing streams (longitudinal reconnection)
•Removal of interior water control structures and agricultural-related berms 
•Enlarge/replace culvert
•Slope perimeter to facilitate wetland to upland wildlife movement (lateral reconnection)
•Naturalization of upland-wetland transitions Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: •Retention of walking trails and an existing access route
•Bridge replacement to facilitate visitor circulation
•Mass Audubon purchased this site with plans to make it an educational and recreational resource to community 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Contaminants from legacy pesticides are still present, but efforts were taken to minimize new exposure and uptake routes. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: •Increased soil moisture
•The area is now a functioning wetland Achieve a desirable species composition: •Native plants are reestablishing including little blue stem (Schizachyrium scoparium), wild indigo (Baptisia tinctoria), Juncus species, and sedges. 
•Wetland bird species such as Sora (Porzana carolina), Marsh Wrens (Cistothorus palustris), and Swamp Sparrows (Melospiza georgiana) have been observed nesting on the property.
•Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), and blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis) have been observed moving through the waterway.
•There are still a number of invasive species colonizing, including reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), Phragmites australis, black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellate), and purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) that will need continued management. Reinstate structural diversity: Microtopography, and large wood installations have added complexity to the land. Recover ecosystem functionality: Movement of organisms, water, sediment and organic matter has been reestablished. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: •Beaver Dam Brook has been opened from its headwaters to Cape Cod Bay for the first time in over 100 years.
•Alewife and blue herring have already been observed moving through the waterway. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The wetland portions of the site benefit from a protected forested buffer that keeps most development away from the restored areas. However, significant development pressure exists in the region, which could lead to future impacts.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: By converting out-of-service cranberry bogs to a wetlands preserve, the project will create a recreational resource that will attract visitors to the Town of Plymouth, which has the potential to improve the local economy. The Town of Plymouth Open Space and Recreation Plan (ORSP) noted that, “Cranberry growing has become less profitable in recent years and many growers are faced with difficult financial situations leading some to sell their land for development, or to mine their land for sand and gravel.” The proposed project is an example of a positive alternative for cranberry farm owners who need to convert their business.
Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: One goal of the project was to increase the connection between people and the land by providing a beautiful, protected area for public use and enjoyment. This will be carried out when Mass Audubon reopens the site to the public as a wildlife sanctuary in late 2017. The property will be open for low impact outdoor recreation, and will eventually provide educational programming for the community. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: Forested wetlands provide many services such as flood protection, water purification and groundwater recharge. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: The site was temporarily closed for recreational use during implementation phase. 
A science-based framework, articulated up front, facilitates key early decisions and brings landowners and partners together.
Simple visual tools help bring data together and develop alternatives.
Keep things simple to communicate your design and intentions.
Vigilance and collaboration help identify risks and opportunities in the field, and create conditions for rapid adaptation and adjustment.
 Tidmarsh East is now owned by Mass Audubon. All of their wildlife sanctuaries are covered by an ecological management plan that “identifies the conservation assets provided by a sanctuary and prescribe actions necessary to maintain or enhance those assets in the face of 21st century challenges”. Being such a new property, they have not finalized a management plan for the Tidmarsh Wildlife Sanctuary. After speaking with the sanctuary director, Lauren Kras, it seems that follow-up years of native planting and invasive species management may be involved in this plan. This project was designed with the goal of the site self-healing over time with adaptive management. The western side of the farm was recently purchased by the Town of Plymouth for public open space.  Also slated for future restoration, the Town is now working with DER, NRCS, Ducks Unlimited, and others on preliminary designs.  Implementation on the west side is scheduled for approximately 2019. Living Observatory, created by owner Glorianna Davenport, is a learning collaborative of scientists, artists, and wetland restoration practitioners engaged in the documenting, interpreting, and revealing aspects of change as it occurs prior to, during, and following the Tidmarsh Farms Restoration Project.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/restoration-of-diamondback-terrapin-nesting-habitat-along-the-potowomut-river-east-greenwich-ri/	USA: Restoration of Diamondback Terrapin Nesting Habitat along the Potowomut River; East Greenwich, RI	United States of America	2016-06	N/A	"The goal for restoration of the marsh located on the campus of the Rocky Hill School along the Potowomut River in East Greenwich, RI is to improve habitat for a recently discovered population of diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin). This brackish water turtle species is state-listed in Rhode Island. The terrapins have been observed using the site for nesting and the focus of the project is to increase nesting areas in order to sustain a thriving population. The project is in its second year of planning in order to assemble a dataset that will allow the development of an appropriate plan to restore the marsh to increase diamondback terrapin nesting habitat, increase hatchling overwintering habitat in the Spartina alterniflora wrack, and reduce predation pressure on the population. Ancillary outcomes of this habitat restoration effort include control of invasive Phragmites australis and enhanced resilience of the salt marsh to sea-level rise. As a part of the planning process, surveys have been conducted on vegetation, tidal elevation and wetland elevation, soils, and mapping of terrapin nesting sites, collection of hatchling emergence data, and propagation of S. alterniflora in a University of Rhode Island greenhouse for low marsh restoration and Ascelepias syriaca to increase pollinator habitat in the freshwater upland.Climate Change, Dams & Hydrology, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) At the Rocky Hill School marsh site, the main causes of degradation are the rising sea level, erosion from high energy tidal systems, human intervention in the form of damming and mowing, wall construction, marsh ditching, as well as invasive species colonization. Throughout Southern New England, coastal marsh systems are being inundated with tidal water at historical levels, an effect of global climate change. These systems are arguably the most affected by increasingly frequent storm events, bombarding the marsh with an abundance of precipitation and high-speed winds from hurricanes and other coastal storm systems. These weather events increase erosion of the shoreline and raise seasonal high tide levels. The Potowomut marsh was mosquito ditched, along with many other marshes, in the mid-1900s. Bisecting the marsh is a stonewall that interferes with sediment distribution along the shoreline; these changes in elevation and hydrology greatly affect vegetation distribution and the quality/area of terrapin nesting habitat. Minor restoration activities have been conducted within the site. A creek that flows in the marsh parallel to the shoreline was excavated to increase water flow into the marsh by the non-profit organization Save the Bay in 2014. In addition, some “runneling” has also been conducted within the marsh by Save the Bay (under the direction of Wenley Ferguson) to help drain inundated marsh areas. The effectiveness of these methodologies has not been quantified. This marsh is a rarity in that is it abutted by an upland barrier of relatively undeveloped land, granting it the opportunity to migrate inland in response to rising sea levels and restoration activities. Without appropriate restoration interventions, the upland barrier will be subject to tidal influx and the marsh will continue to subside. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on contemporary reference sites or existing analogues of the pre-degradation ecosystem.The goal is to restore the Potowomut River salt marsh on Rocky Hill School’s property to the full extent of a self-sustaining and functional marsh. This includes habitat for coastal biodiversity, carbon sequestration and recreational value, protection against waves, storm surge, coastal erosion, and sea level rise. Reference sites include restored salt marsh sites, relatively undisturbed marshes, and sites where successful and thriving populations of terrapins nest. The planning process of this restoration is extremely thorough in order to ensure that the proper prescription of restoration actions is taken to reach these goals. The ultimate goal for restoration of the marsh located on the campus of the Rocky Hill School along the Potowomut River in East Greenwich, RI is to improve habitat for a previously unknown population of diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin). Ancillary outcomes of this habitat restoration effort include control of the invasive Phragmites australis, and enhanced resilience of the salt marsh to sea-level rise. As a part of the planning process, surveys have been conducted on vegetation, tide elevation and wetland elevation, mapping of terrapin nesting sites, collection of hatchling emergence data, and propagation of S. alterniflora, A. syriaca.

Monitoring Details: As the restoration is in the planning phase, much of the monitoring happening on site is gathering baseline data to determine an appropriate and effective restoration design. Start date, including baseline data collection: 2016 End Date: 2018
The primary stakeholders at this site are the owners of the marsh property, Rocky Hill School. Secondary stakeholders are the surrounding land and homeowners of the site, with whom the primary stakeholders wish to maintain positive and supportive relationships, URI, and CRMC.

Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Factors limiting the recovery of the ecosystem are the adaptability of terrapin nesting habits during peak restoration implementation, where many disruptive activities may be going on along the shoreline. Funding is also a limiting factor, as the project in contingent upon the approval of funding proposals at grant agencies. Stakeholder buy-in from local residents is also a potentially limiting issue.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The prolonged resiliency of the salt marsh will help preserve the industry of quahoging, shellfishing and fishing that happens along the marsh and within the greater Narragansett Bay. The marsh at Rocky Hill is a crucial source of food, shelter, spawning, nursery areas and refuge from predators for fish and shellfish.
Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: While difficult to quantify, there is typically vast public support for salt marsh restoration in Southern New England. Restoration increases recreational value, property value, and wildlife habitat, which many people claim to value. The marsh property is open to the public and frequented by many community members for walking, kayaking, swimming, sailing and fishing. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: The marsh and its plant community protects from high energy storm systems, taking on a portion of the velocity and water that would otherwise inundate its surrounding community. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: The restoration is expected to temporarily limit recreational access to the beachfront of the marsh and the boating area approximately 10 meters off shore. This delineated boundary will prevent any disturbance to the nesting season of the terrapin population, as well as allow for safe and uninterrupted implementation of restoration design when the project reaches that phase. The ongoing planning stages of this project limit evaluation as lessons are developing as restoration initiatives more forward. However, as the planning stages have resulted in more data, focus of restoration design has shifted. Initially, it was thought that the success of the terrapins nesting season was limited by predation and recreational land use. While this is partially true, our baseline data findings indicate that the dysfunctional and chaotic structure of the marsh zones, hydrology, and sediment deposition are more likely to be limiting the suitable nesting habitat available for terrapins. It is anticipated that yearly monitoring will follow post-implementation, to measure success and for publications. The strong support from and relationship with the Rocky Hill School and URI will continue throughout the restoration process and will provide excellent experiential learning and internship opportunities for Rocky Hill, URI and other students.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/terraseixe-environmental-stewardship-in-southwestern-portugal/	Portugal: TerraSeixe: environmental stewardship in southwestern Portugal	Portugal	2016-07	2021-07	"This is a landscape-based project, using the Seixe River basin (watershed/catchment) as the unit for analysis. Nature Conservation Instruments, a protected area, 2 Natura 2000 network sites and an Important Bird and Biodiversity area overlap to provide protection for 93% of the project area. Ecologically this is an area of high biodiversity, which has legal protection but little, to no, actual protection in place. Socially, around 50% of the area is used for eucalyptus plantations (pulp and biomass) production, the area is used for local small-scale agricultural production and, over the last 30 years or so, has seen a large number of land-plots being abandoned. The goal is to restore biodiversity and ecosystems via an integrated management (plan) as a participative and consultative process as all land is owned privately. Restoration will be done based on current/on-going ecological studies, and will be at the behest of land-owners, or in collaboration with local municipal authorities where land has been abandoned. So far, apart from setting up a strategic partnership platform (11 institutional and organisational partners) the project, which started in July 2016, has a long way to go.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fire & Weather Events, Fragmentation, Other Main cause: land use, i.e. the development of eucalyptus plantations – land clearing. Underlying causes: land abandonment after agricultural use.
Effects on ecosystem structure/function, impacts on biodiversity: land clearing and development of terraces for planting of monoculture plantations (simplified ecosystem) destroys biodiversity and severely degrades natural ecosystems.
Landscape-scale: concern over ecosystem services, desertification and climate change impacts (studies being conducted).
Socioeconomic: questions around sustainability of socioeconomic environment (studies being conducted).
Political factors: decision-making and policies (hence reason for strategic partnerships). The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).Studies are being conducted – ongoing. Expect results in 4-6 months. 
To restore the natural functioning and protection for inherent ecosystems in the river basin;
To develop and implement an Integrated Management Plan for the sustainable management of land and forests, and to  ensure the conservation of biodiversity and the restoration of degraded or destroyed ecosystems;
To define a green infrastructure for integration into a broad network of ecological corridors from a multifunctional landscape perspective;
To create a climate refuge that constitutes an experimental and demonstration area for climate change adaptation and mitigation;
To develop an Environmental Centre to support environmental education, ecotourism, research and scientific tourism at the international level, with a view to supporting future rural area development and river basin management.


The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Landowners and land-users: an ongoing process working with the 3 municipal authorities by following a public participation process (informative, participative and consultative) with the aim of establishing ownership for the actions needed to create a sustainable future for the people of the Seixe River Basin.
Planning process: as land is private, the project will, via the municipal authorities, engage with stakeholders to develop an Integrated Management Plan. For restoration purposes, the project, via the municipal authorities, engages with landowners to establish sub-projects for land-use planning (zoning and socioeconomic) and for ecological restoration based on the network of ecological corridors.
Education and outreach: the project has a schools programme for environmental education, and will engage in public workshops for awareness building and dissemination of information. A project website is under construction as well. The overall aim is to develop a ‘citizen-science’ outreach that involves as many youth as possible, bit that caters for adults and other interested parties.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/restoration-of-leachate-impacted-wetlands-and-associated-mitigation-at-the-university-of-connecticut-landfill/	USA: Restoration of Leachate-Impacted Wetlands and Associated Mitigation at the University of Connecticut Landfill	United States of America	1998-06	2008-05	"On June 26, 1998, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CTDEP) issued a Consent Order to the University of Connecticut (UConn) requiring that a remedial action plan (RAP) be formulated to abate pollution emanating from the university’s landfill and former chemical pits, which operated between 1966 and 1993. The disposal areas became sources of contamination of wetland sediments, surface water, and domestic wells through the migration and discharge of leachate-contaminated groundwater. Actions necessary to close the landfill, treat leachate, and remove contaminated sediments required the unavoidable disturbance and/or loss of adjacent freshwater wetlands—a violation of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. UConn was issued a permit by the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) and CTDEP requiring that wetlands be restored and/or created as compensatory mitigation, and that there be no net loss of wetland area, function, or value. Mitigation activities resulted in greater than 1:1 areal compensation (1.02) of wetland disturbance/losses; wetlands of greater diversity (biological and physical), function, and value than pre-restoration conditions; and the establishment of a conservation area that is used recreationally and educationally by the local and UConn communities. Thorough annual monitoring and adaptive management were key to the success of this project.Agriculture & Livestock, Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological), Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Mining & Resource Extraction The UConn landfill was operational between 1966 and 1993 and was filled primarily with paper (85%) and mixed refuse (15%-chemicals and trash). Organic solvents, chlorinated hydrocarbons, pump oils & aromatic hydrocarbons, and herbicides & pesticides were deposited in adjacent chemical pits that operated between 1966 and 1987. The waste disposal areas were unlined, which meant that rainwater infiltrating though the landfill and chemical pits produced leachate that was contaminating nearby groundwater, surface water, and sediments with heavy metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) and other chemicals. In the adjacent wetlands, toxic metals were precipitating on wetland sediments (see Figure 3). Although Haley & Aldrich (H&A) conducted formal assessments of the impacts of groundwater and sediment contamination, no formal assessment of the impacts of the contamination on biota was conducted. However, the bioaccumulative properties of heavy metals in plants and animals and their negative impacts to human health are well-understood and documented. Some homes to the west of the landfill are connected to UConn water because of historic well contamination with chemicals traced back to landfill leachate. The concern of the local and university communities for their health and well-being garnered widespread support for the remediation project in the context of the contamination. The restoration of the wetlands was not a community focus per se, but it was a necessary part of the remediation process from both an ecological and regulatory perspective.
Other causes of degradation to the wetlands stem from UConn’s role as a land grant agricultural university. Farming activities for the university began in the 1800s, which involved clearing of land near the wetlands, agricultural nutrient runoff, drainage of wetlands in certain areas, and the development of university facilities nearby. Sand and gravel mining activities also used to occur in the glacial till deposits located in the conservation land that was established during this project (the HEEP). These activities required the building of temporary roads adjacent to and through some portions of wetland, which had hydrologic impacts.
Wetland areas closest to the landfill were especially degraded pre-restoration. Some areas were heavily invaded by Common Reed (Phragmites australis) and Reed Canary Grass (Phalaris arundinacea). Approximately 82% of the wetland area expected to be lost through remediation activities was considered degraded according to the functional assessments conducted by Mason and Associates, Inc. (M&A). A primary goal for the wetlands created/restored through this project was that they have greater functional value than the pre-restoration wetlands. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on contemporary reference sites or existing analogues of the pre-degradation ecosystem.Considering the extent and legacy of historic degradation of the wetlands at the site and the expected impacts of the landfill remediation activities on the wetlands, restoring to a historic ecosystem was deemed impractical. Historic aerials of the site reveal drainage ditches, fill roads, and beaver activity that have altered wetland hydrology and changed vegetative communities profoundly since the 1800s. The landfill closure plan was expected to result in wetland losses through direct filling and indirect hydrologic modification, requiring the creation of new wetlands as part of the wetland mitigation plan and regulatory compliance.
Baseline studies of wetlands to be restored/lost provided the information on plant community types and flora subsequently used to plan restoration & creation sites. The restored/created wetlands would have a species assemblage characteristic of wetlands of the northeastern US, be delineable, and be classified as their planned habitat type as described in the Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States (Cowardin et al. 1979) (PFO-Palustrine Forested, PSS-Palustrine Scrub-Shrub, PEM-Palustrine Emergent, PAB-Palustrine Aquatic Bed). To gauge restoration/creation success, fundamental wetland attributes, including dominance of native hydrophytic vegetation, proper hydrologic regime for the intended wetland habitat, and hydric soil development were evaluated.
Increasing wetland functions and values was a priority in the planning and design of the mitigation wetlands. M&A performed functional assessments of the wetlands before and after restoration using the Highway Methodology. Mitigation wetlands were to have greater functions and values than their pre-restoration condition. Remediation Goals:

Characterize contaminant sources, extent, and migration pathways per the Consent Order
Eliminate leachate discharge to surface waters
Protect public health by mitigating or containing contaminants that threaten domestic wells
Wetland mitigation (restoration & creation) – see below

The compensatory mitigation plan included a combination of wetland restoration, wetland creation, wetland enhancement, and preservation of adjacent uplands to fulfill the overarching mitigation goals:

No net loss of wetland area, functions, or values
Restoration of wetland habitats disturbed by sediment remediation
Creation of wetland with reliable source of wetland hydrology
Buffering natural and created wetlands from human activity
Enhancement of wildlife habitat
Vernal pool creation (added post-2004 mitigation plan, per USFWS suggestion during the permitting process)
Control of problem invasive and exotic plant species
Practicable, cost-effective construction

Socio-economic

Development of a conservation area that could be used recreationally and educationally by the local and UConn communities


Monitoring Details: ACOE required that UConn provide annual monitoring reports for 5 years post-construction per the Section 404 permit.
CTDEP required that UConn provide annual monitoring reports for 10 years post-construction.

Preliminary assessments of the contamination began in the late 1980s, but more thorough studies of the extent of the soil, surface, and groundwater pollution began after CTDEP issued UConn a Consent Order on June 26, 1998. H&A conducted a comprehensive hydrogeologic investigation to understand groundwater movement at the site and determine the identity and movement of contaminants emanating from the landfill. They also determined the extent of the sediment contamination. In 2003, M&A delineated and mapped wetland boundaries and performed functional assessments of the wetlands. In addition, they conducted baseline studies of the wetlands to be restored/lost to provide information on plant community types and flora for vegetation planning of the mitigation wetlands. Start date, including baseline data collection: Baseline Collection-June 1998, Monitoring began-May 2008 End Date: Federal ACOE Monitoring-Summer 2013, State CTDEEP Monitoring-Summer 2017
The primary stakeholders of the project included the UConn community, neighborhood residents, the Town of Mansfield, CTDEEP, and ACOE.
There has been a long-term public outreach – public information program for the landfill remediation project.  All the progress reports and monitoring reports related to landfill closure and mitigation activities were made accessible online to the stakeholders. Earlier in the project during remediation activities, a series of newsletters and “reader’s guides” were published to summarize the detailed reports, provide updates, explain procedures, define terms, and provide the contact information of project members who could be reached to answer questions.
Public information meetings, hearings, and the project website were used to inform and gather opinion from the public. Agency stakeholders were also highly involved in the permit process. The stakeholders reviewed and gave feedback on the series of mitigation alternatives presented in the Conceptual Wetland Mitigation Plan before being incorporated in the final permit application. The project was also the subject of land use planning meetings held by UConn with the Town of Mansfield.
There has also been an educational outreach effort to involve faculty and students in the restoration project. The site has been used as an outdoor classroom for wetland, wildlife, forestry, ornithology, and environmental engineering classes. The site was part of the 2015 BioBlitz held at UConn, which included biodiversity surveys with young children and their families at one of the restoration sites (see Figure 4). Several undergraduate and graduate students have done projects involving restoration site monitoring.

Description of Project Activities: Post-restoration results (as of 2016 monitoring report):
•1.31 hectares (3.23 acres) wetland restoration
•0.82 hectares (2.03 acres) wetland loss
•0.84 hectares (2.08 acres) wetland creation (1.02:1 compensation)
•366 meters (1200 feet) stream restoration
•5.02 hectares (12.4 acres) invasive species control 
•Entire project area (HEEP – Hillside Environmental Education Park): 26.30 hectares (65 acres)
See Figure 1 for a detailed map of the mitigation areas.
See Figure 2 for a map of the entire HEEP area. How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: H&A planned and implemented several actions to properly close the landfill, eliminate existing contamination, and effectively prevent future contamination of the ecosystems adjacent to the site. 

 After receiving permits from ACOE and CTDEP, sediments were removed from contaminated wetlands and placed on top of the landfill within the landfill footprint. Those wetlands that underwent contaminated sediment removal were the focus of wetland restoration activities for this project. In addition to removing contaminated sediments, debris and trash were removed from adjacent wetlands and placed on the landfill. To accommodate the volume of material added to the landfill, the slopes of the landfill had to be regraded, requiring the filling of wetlands adjacent to the landfill. To compensate for the wetland losses, wetlands were to be created at a 1:1 (loss:creation) areal compensation ratio, as per the regulations and agreements in the permit.

H&A installed leachate interceptor trenches (LITs) adjacent to the north and south edges of the landfill to collect contaminated groundwater and direct it to UConn’s Water Pollution Control Facility for treatment. The diversion of leachate was expected to cause loss of wetlands whose hydrology was dependent on groundwater discharged from the landfill. The combined loss of wetlands from both direct filling and indirect hydrologic modification totaled 0.82 hectares (2.03 acres), requiring 0.82 hectares (2.03 acres) of wetland creation/compensation per the ACOE permit. 

The landfill was capped with earth fill, a geocomposite drainage net (to collect gases generated by the landfill), a polyethylene flexible membrane liner (highly impermeable layer), non-woven geotextile, crushed stone, and asphalt to reduce infiltration into the landfill and direct leachate into the LITs instead of the environment. The UConn community now uses the top-most asphalt layer as a parking lot. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: The hydrology of the wetland mitigation areas was expected to be driven by groundwater, which requires proper interception of the water table. H&A used their preliminary hydrogeologic data to model the groundwater regime post-landfill closure, taking into consideration the groundwater flow/budget alterations imposed by the LITs. M&A considered the location of the water table in combination with the type of wetland habitat (ex. emergent marsh, wet meadow, shrub/forested swamp) they intended to create in particular areas of the site to plan the elevation of the wetlands. A wetland’s elevation in relation to the water table affects its hydroperiod, which ultimately determines the vegetative communities that can exist. Similarly, for the vernal pool creation, pools were dug to depths that would support a hydroperiod conducive with breeding by specialist amphibians. M&A installed groundwater wells, staff gauges, water level sensors, and soil moisture sensors to monitor ground and surface hydrology, especially in potentially problematic areas like the wetland creation sites at higher elevations and those wetlands near the LITs. 

New soil had to be brought into the wetland mitigation sites to replace the contaminated sediments. The ACOE recommends that topsoil used in wetland creation/restoration/enhancement have 6-21% organic matter (by weight) minimum. A mixture of mineral soils, excavated from the wetland creation areas, and organic soils, derived from the buried organic deposits of a nearby filled wetland on the UConn campus, was laid 1-2 feet thick in the wetland restoration and creation areas, depending on the water table depth and desired wetland habitat. Manure from UConn agricultural facilities and compost were also used as soil amendments in order to meet the 8.6% OM criterion for emergent wetland areas and 20.6% OM criterion for forested areas. Using locally sourced soil material was a more cost-effective option. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Over 20 species of hydrophytes were planted in the wetland mitigation areas as part of the revegetation plan. Since the reference system for this project was contemporary, M&A sought to achieve high native plant diversity and expected and encouraged species from nearby, undisturbed reference wetlands to establish in the mitigation wetlands. M&A also considered the intended wetland habitat and natural wetland plant succession when making planting decisions and when monitoring vegetation changes and trends post-restoration. 

M&A established 52 permanent vegetation plots in the mitigation sites to monitor trends in vegetation succession and determine % cover, % hydrophytes, % invasive species, and # of woody plants greater than 18” tall from year to year. 8 plots were also established in nearby reference wetlands to monitor intended plant community development and volunteer species establishment in the mitigation wetlands. M&A performed comprehensive reconnaissance of wetland vegetation in each mitigation site annually to assess overall species abundance, identify unknown species, and monitor invasive species occurrence. M&A carried out a combination of hand pulling and spot herbicide (glyphosate) application to control invasive plants, including: Common Reed, Reed Canary Grass, Multiflora Rose (Rosa multiflora), Glossy Buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula), Purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), Autumn Olive (Elaeagnus umbellata), and Japanese Stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum) among others. More extensive, aggressive spraying activity occurred in wetlands invaded heavily by Common Reed; sometimes requiring the use of tracked vehicles to reach deeper into large stands. Regrowth of native vegetation was monitored and documented. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): The original mitigation plan required that the mitigation wetlands have greater habitat/spatial diversity than their pre-restoration condition to promote wildlife habitat. M&A designed wetlands with mound and pool topography (see Figure 5) with pools of varying sizes and depths to support different hydroperiods, which dictates what species can utilize certain pools and when. Hydroperiod diversity also influences the types of vegetative communities that can exist in certain areas. Emergent marshes are generally composed of herbaceous vegetation with relatively uniform vertical structure, whereas scrub-shrub and forested swamps have spatial diversity vertically due to the occurrence of multiple vegetation types: short herbaceous emergents, moderately tall shrubs, and tall trees. Special habitat features like standing snags, logs, stumps and root wads, sandy areas, boulders, and rock piles were also added to increase microhabitat. As per the ACOE permit and mitigation standards, at least 2% of the mitigation area had to be covered with coarse woody debris. After mitigation construction, the total surface area covered with coarse woody debris was closer to 4%.

When restoring the streams, M&A designed streams with riffles and pools, different substrates (cobble, sand, mud), and varying degrees of flow duration and sinuosity. 

The conservation land established adjacent to the mitigation sites also contains a variety of upland and wetland habitats. How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): As part of the ACOE permit, restored/created wetlands needed to have greater functional value than their pre-restoration condition, which M&A determined using the Highway Methodology. 

Special habitat features like standing snags, logs, stumps and root wads, sandy areas, boulders, and rock piles were added to provide nesting, cover, basking sites, thermal refugia, and other functions for certain species. M&A identified wildlife by sight, photograph, sound, track, scat, and egg and skull morphology during site visits to determine occurrence and assess the value of the mitigation wetlands for wildlife habitat.

Establishing proper hydroperiods in the mitigation wetlands influences decomposition rates of organic matter and reestablishes the wetland function of carbon sequestration. The degree and duration of inundation is a key stressor in wetland systems that influences wetland chemistry, which ultimately directs nutrient cycling and the occurrence of hydrophytic vegetation. M&A included wetland vegetation that could provide cover, food (ex. Highbush Blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum; Arrowwood, Viburnum dentatum), or other services to wildlife for the vegetation plan. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): The 65-acre (26.30-hectare) HEEP conservation area was established to buffer human activity, but it would also act as a permanent habitat patch for species dispersal through the moderately developed surrounding area, which includes the UConn campus and residential neighborhoods. It would also provide valuable upland habitat for those species that use resources from or have life history stages requiring both wetland and upland habitat. 

Approximately 1200 feet of streams were expected to be impacted by the sediment remediation, filling activities, and hydrologic modification associated with the landfill closure. Stream losses were compensated for at a 1:1 ratio. M&A surveyed and described the original streams so that their properties (substrate, sinuosity, ephemerality) and connection between wetlands could be replicated in the mitigated wetlands. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: Properly capping the landfill and redirecting and treating leachate were necessary to ensure safety of domestic groundwater for human consumption and safe physical access to the wetlands. To address and alleviate the concerns of the public, a series of public hearings were held pre-restoration. Also, all the progress reports and plans related to the landfill closure and mitigation activities were made accessible online to the public. In the early stages of the project, a series of newsletters and “reader’s guides” were written meant to summarize some of the material in the lengthy reports, provide updates, define terms, offer a contact who could be reached to answer questions, and inform about meetings that the public could attend. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The landfill was successfully capped and the LITs are functional, redirecting leachate for treatment. 

The wetland area that was degraded/lost in order to build the LITs and other landfill closure structures was completely compensated. 2016 wetland delineations revealed that the wetland area created was actually greater than the wetland area lost—a 1.02:1 areal compensation ratio.

These outcomes satisfy the remediation goals of eliminating leachate discharge to surface waters, protecting public health by mitigating or containing contaminants that threaten domestic wells, and wetland mitigation. These outcomes also satisfy the mitigation goal of no net loss of wetland area. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: Desired wetland hydrology was achieved in all mitigation areas and created vernal pools, except near the stormwater basin. The mitigation wetlands have responded well to dynamic changes in water levels resulting from intermittent beaver activity and periods of extreme drought and precipitation post-construction.

Delineations of the mitigation wetlands suggest that appropriate hydric soil properties are being expressed, according to Chapter 3, ‘Procedures for Sampling Soils’, of the Interim Regional Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Northcentral and Northeast Regions Army Corps of Engineers (October 2009). 

These outcomes satisfy the mitigation goals of creating wetland with reliable wetland hydrology, vernal pool creation, and restoration of habitats affected by sediment remediation. Achieve a desirable species composition: Most of the Success Standards for Wetland Mitigation related to vegetation outlined by the ACOE have been met. There is nearly 100% cover across all mitigation sites, 90%+ of which is hydrophytes. Over 300 plant species have been identified in the mitigation sites overall. Species diversity has been decreasing in more recent years, but this is to be expected because of natural wetland succession. As shrubs and trees grow taller and develop more mature canopies, certain herbaceous species can no longer persist. Overall, there is relatively low invasive species abundance, but problem areas still do exist even after ten years of monitoring and invasive species management, particularly with Common Reed and Japanese Stiltgrass. M&A documented regrowth of native vegetation in some, but not all, wetland areas that received extensive Common Reed treatment.

The woody plant density criteria were not met in all mitigation areas due to herbivory of planted shrubs and trees by deer and small mammals. 

The mitigation goal of invasive species control has been achieved in many, but not all wetland areas. Under the HEEP Conservation Agreement, UConn envisions continued invasive species monitoring and control. Reinstate structural diversity: Desired wetland habitat types and their associated water regimes and vegetative communities were achieved in most wetland mitigation areas. In recent years, some emergent marsh areas have been converting to scrub-shrub wetlands as woody shrubs and trees grow taller and develop more mature canopies, which was expected as part of natural wetland succession. Mounds and pools have added habitat and water regime diversity to the mitigation wetlands.

The woody edges of the mitigation construction areas also contribute to habitat diversity and abundance. The HEEP conservation area is considered excellent wildlife habitat and contributes to the long-term habitat value of the mitigation areas.

These outcomes satisfy the mitigation goals of no net loss of wetland function or value, enhancement of wildlife habitat, and restoration of wetland habitats disturbed by sediment remediation. Recover ecosystem functionality: In addition to achieving greater than 1:1 areal compensation (1.02), the post-restoration functional assessment data suggest that the mitigation wetlands exhibit greater functions and values than their pre-restoration condition, especially as habitat for wildlife. Wildlife use of all areas is very high (see Figure 6). Numerous animals have been documented using the special habitat features, including: amphibian breeding in created vernal pools and pools within mitigation wetlands, use of woody debris and rock piles as refugia by small mammals and reptiles, use of pools with prolonged groundwater discharge as watering holes by birds and mammals in winter while other pools were frozen, and use of boulders, mounds, and logs as basking sites by reptiles (among many other observations). Wildlife habitat was determined the principal function of many of the wetland creation areas, even though much of the pre-existing wetland area was considered degraded habitat dominated by Common Reed and Reed Canary Grass. 

These outcomes satisfy the mitigation goals of no net loss of wetland function or value and enhancement of wildlife habitat. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: UConn established a Conservation Agreement with CTDEEP for the HEEP ensuring long-term protection of the 65-acre area, which includes the mitigation wetlands and surrounding upland and wetland habitat. This also ensures long-term protection of the HEEP as a habitat patch for wildlife dispersal. 

All 366 meters (1200 feet) of stream were successfully restored. The leachate control measures ensure the quality of the water discharged from the wetland streams into other water bodies.

These outcomes satisfy the mitigation goals of buffering natural and created wetlands from human activity, enhancement of wildlife habitat, and no net loss of wetland function or value. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Even after ten years of monitoring and control, invasive species are still receiving extensive management attention. Common Reed and Japanese Stiltgrass are currently the most problematic invaders. They either form dense monocultures, which crowd out native species, or intersperse with native vegetation in isolated patches, which can be difficult to locate and treat without inadvertently impacting native vegetation. Japanese Stiltgrass is more problematic in the mitigation wetlands, and tends to intermix with other wetland plants. However, Common Reed is so prolific in some areas of the wetlands just north and west of the mitigation wetlands (Wetland C) that M&A has used a low impact, tracked vehicle to venture into the larger stands to apply herbicide with power sprayers (see Figure 7). The proximity of the Common Reed stands and the aggressive nature of invasives threaten the diverse plant communities of the mitigation wetlands, which is why continued monitoring and treatment of invasives will be imperative for long-term management of the site.  

Highly variable weather periods post-construction appeared to affect the development of the mitigated wetlands during the first few years post-construction. The mitigation wetlands at higher elevations initially developed slower in response to dry periods post-construction; to the point where it was uncertain if areal compensation would be achieved.

Herbivory of planted shrubs and trees by deer and small mammals was especially problematic in the first few years post-construction. The development of scrub-shrub and forested wetlands, which have certain shrub/tree height and density characteristics, was delayed until adaptive management measures, like replantings and herbivore deterrents, were put in place. Because of this herbivory, the shrub/tree density ACOE Success Standard was not met in all scrub-shrub and forested swamp wetlands.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The HEEP has provided and is expected to continue to provide many monitoring, educational, and research opportunities for UConn undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: Leachate and contaminated sediment remediation measures have improved the quality of the surface water and groundwater discharged from the wetlands, which eventually reaches domestic wells and other drinking water sources. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: The Hillside Environmental Education Park (HEEP) is a 65-acre conservation area that includes the mitigated wetlands and open space to the north and northwest. An official conservation agreement with CTDEP was formulated, granting long-term protection of the land and its responsible recreational and educational use. Walking trails, boardwalks and observation platforms, and educational signage were erected in the park for recreational and educational use by the local and UConn communities. In addition, UConn natural resource classes use the HEEP as an educational resource. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: The landfill closure and remedial actions have improved groundwater quality and increased the safety of drinking water originating from domestic wells near the former landfill, which was a primary concern among local community members. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: N/A Thorough yearly monitoring of the mitigation wetlands post-construction and associated adaptive management were integral, and will continue to be integral, to the long-term success of this project.
Extensive hydrologic monitoring was important since precipitation can be highly variable from year to year. Periods of drought following construction resulted in slower wetland development in some wetland creation areas. M&A took precipitation variability into consideration before deciding to take adaptive management actions in case slower wetland development was merely a symptom of reduced precipitation and not impaired overall hydrologic function. Unnecessary management could have had negative effects on the development of the mitigation wetlands. In cases where wetland or vernal pool hydrology was indeed impaired, adaptive management strategies like minor corrective grading (ex. excavating or filling pools) and intermittent stream excavation (to drain certain areas and achieve certain hydroperiods) were utilized.
In response to deer and small mammal herbivory of planted shrubs and trees, M&A tried several herbivore deterrent methods, including: garlic sticks, deer repellent, small wire fence enclosures, and tree tubes. Small wire fence enclosures and tree tubes were the most effective methods. M&A also carried out supplemental tree and shrub plantings in the areas most heavily impacted by the herbivory.
Although using locally sourced soil amendments was a cost-effective strategy, M&A recommends conducting germination tests on the soil. It’s possible that some of the weeds and invasive species present in the mitigation wetlands, which in some cases required extensive control and supplemental planting effort, originated from the soil amendments.
M&A also recommends checking the quality of the seed mixes sold by nurseries. The seed mix M&A used had high upland weed content (especially clovers, Trifolium spp.) that could have influenced wetland plant establishment and in some cases required supplemental plantings. It is also important to make sure that plant material is not mislabeled. M&A discovered that around 20 shrubs labeled as native Speckled Alder (Alnus incana) were actually the very similar-looking, but invasive, European Alder (Alnus glutinosa). The European Alder were promptly located, cut down, and herbicide was applied directly to the cut stumps.
M&A also found that designing the mitigation wetlands with high habitat diversity was extremely effective at promoting wildlife habitat. Effective methods included mound and pool topography and the many aforementioned special habitat features. An official long-term management plan is still being drafted and is set to be finalized in 2018. Long term management of the wetland restoration falls within the overall long term management of the HEEP. The Conservation Agreement (CA) requires preservation of the wetland mitigation areas within the HEEP (including the restoration and creation sites, designated open space, trails, boardwalks and observation platforms) “in perpetuity”. The HEEP CA requires that access be available to the public and that education, recreation and habitat conservation functions be preserved (among others).  UConn’s Office of Environmental Policy and the UConn Forester have key stewardship roles in long term management of the HEEP. CTDEEP, the Town of Mansfield, and the public users of the HEEP are also important stakeholders. UConn plans to continue an adaptive management approach to address changing priorities. To fulfill its stewardship role, UConn envisions yearly monitoring and invasive species control, with periodic updates to the management plan. Monitoring of vegetation, water levels, wildlife use, and trail features is expected. Forest management is expected to include selective cutting.

State and federal agencies, businesses and non-profits banded together to restore the Penobscot River watershed. Two dam removals and the construction of one fish by-pass, and one modernized fish ladder resulted in over 2,000 km of connected migratory fish passage concluding a massive restoration project. The ongoing population decline of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) sparked this drive for restoration. This habitat may be North America’s last hope in restoring this endangered population. Atlantic Salmon thrives in the Penobscot waters and has been historically harvested for centuries by the Penobscot Indian Nation. Dam removal provides benefits for ten other species of catadromous and anadromous fish that migrate through these waters to and from the ocean. The recovery of the fish (striped bass (Morone saxatilis), alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrhynchus oxyrhynchus), shortnose sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum, Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), American eel (Anguilla rostrate)) will affect local food chains, recreational and commercial fishing industries, and the overall resiliency of the ecosystem.Dams & Hydrology, Fisheries & Aquaculture, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Up to 97% of the historical range of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was severed by the construction of dams in the Penobscot River watershed. Ten other species of migratory fish were affected and other species that interacted with these fish suffered in their absence. These dams were built during a time when hydroelectric power was in high demand and every undammed waterway was viewed as a waste of natural resources. The Nature Conservancy reports that from 1830-2013 only 4% of fish habitat was left available for migratory species, and at its high point the river systems had close to 150 dams. These dams directly affected the marine and aquatic life that depend on this waterway to reproduce. Their life cycles were abruptly disturbed causing all species to adapt to their new environment. For example, when levels of migratory prey fish were reduced, the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) targeted waterfowl more often, increasing pressure.
The Penobscot River Trust reports that the river supports spawning of 60-70% of all Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and the damming of this river is correlated with the severe decline in wild Atlantic salmon stocks and declines in other fish populations. Socio-economically, these dams at one time fueled the industrial boom. The river is still used for electricity production and many of these dams are out of the scope of the dam removal project thereby keeping a large portion of the river disconnected from salmon runs. The two dams removed in this project were both energy producing dams, but both significantly blocked access to the watershed. The Great Works dam, in place since the 1830’s and replaced in 1887, was the first dam to be removed. The second dam to be removed was the Veazie dam which was first installed in the 1830’s with an updated dam that was completed in 1913. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).It has been calculated that these waters before the 1820’s damming boom saw the migration of 75-100 thousand Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), 14-20 million river herring (combination of two species, alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, and blueback herring, Alosa aestivalis), and 3-5 million American shad (Alosa sapidissima). Through the damning of the river, overharvesting, and pollution of the river from human expansion, fish abundance has dropped to mere thousands of individuals compared to the large numbers seen before mass human interaction. According to NOAA’s climate data, the average temperature in Maine at the earliest recorded date of 1895 averaged ~ 390 F compared to 410F in 2015. This shift in average temperature may also add a stressor to these fish species in peril. A baseline ecosystem was not present to compare river systems but researchers could monitor how native species respond to the changes in predatory and prey species. These data assisted the researchers in understanding that the removal of the dams would help return the system back to a similar pre-dam state. Population numbers are not expected to reach the pre-European settlement numbers, but are expected to rebound significantly. Due to the lack of a benchmark for how the river flowed before the construction of the dams, there was little reconstruction of the flow of the river. Instead, it has been left to restore itself and has begun to show signs of success. Clearly, without the removal of the dams, attempts to restore the river would be futile and a waste of resources. Allowing the removal of two of the major dams allowed natural processes to remediate the river. Atlantic salmon recovery was one of main purposes for the restoration. The population of Atlantic salmon is in decline and listed as endangered by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Historically salmon roamed the length of this river system and were a staple to the diet of Penobscot Indian Nation. Culturally they are a targeted fish for commercial and recreational purposes, and with their species in critical condition, the restoration of this river is seen as one of the last hopes for a comeback of the population. This fish would become the figurehead for the other fish species native to the river including; striped bass (Morone saxatilis), alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrhynchus oxyrhynchus), shortnose sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum, Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), and American eel (Anguilla rostrate). All of these species are expected to increase in number post-restoration and can be considered a main target of interest. To achieve this goal, the habitat for reproduction needed to be returned to the fish through dam removal. Dams segmented the river and many energy producing dams owned by the power company PPL had been battling over relicensing. The solution for relicensing came by the purchase of three dams by the Penobscot River Restoration Trust which intended to deconstruct two dams and improve fish passage past the third dam while maintaining current electricity generation needs. The increase of energy outputs of dams upstream was also added providing a win-win solution for PPL, the local towns that relied on the power output, and those in favor of the restoration. These measures were intended to allow the fish access to historical migration sites to reproduce and repopulate the river. After the deconstruction, monitoring systems would be set in place and the altered ecosystem would then be monitored for success.

Start date, including baseline data collection: Baseline data was collected during the mid 2000's and after each dam was removed, a post monitoring program began. End Date: No known date at this time.
Dam relicensing was a driving factor for the participation of the power companies. After years of relicensing issues, it was beneficial for them to sell three of their dams, and maintain the same power generation output. Acquiring funds for the project demanded the creation of the Penobscot River Restoration Trust and all parties to agree on a major goal of the project. This coalition provided management and funding that powered the restoration. The Penobscot River Nation provided a back bone to the project as their culture and fishing rights have been limited since the additions of the dams. They were very supportive of the project and helped with outreach. One of the major factors in educating the general public was the presentations held at local town community meetings and events where direct community outreach and concerns could be heard. National and statewide outreach would be primarily educated by the media through many different newspaper, and televised news stations. Public involvement helped raise funds for the project as a large portion of the funds were funded by private donations.

How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: In 2010 the Penobscot River Restoration Trust purchased the Veazie, Howland and Great Works dams for 25 million dollars from the existing power company owners. Planning the removal of the dams would begin and it wouldn’t be until 2012 when deconstruction began on the Great Works dam. Beginning the project in June 2012, it was completed by the end of November. The Veazie dam removal followed similarly with the demolition beginning in June 2013 and finishing in November, and the last powerhouse would not be removed until late October 2014. From here the fish could now freely move through most of the river. With an increased flow, the river began to naturally reshape itself exposing sites of rapids that would eventually be used for recreational watersports. This would not be the end, though, as the other dam the trust purchased needed remediation to allow fish passage. The Howland dam was also purchased in 2010 and would remain standing, but a fish passage bypass was created. This required the removal of fifty tons of contaminated soil paid for by funding through the EPA’s Brownfield’s grant program. This area was historically a tannery, paper mill, plywood factory and eventually a hydropower dam. This drop in water level behind the Howland impoundment was reported to be around five feet and required the area’s boat launch to be reconstructed and currently there is more planning for the area to be accessible for recreational activities. This compromise allows for recreational activities to continue while a sufficient solution for migratory fish passage is reached. How this project reinstated appropriate physical conditions (e.g. hydrology, substrate)"",: The removal of the dams allows a natural sediment flow. Now flow of nutrients and sediment is dictated by the pace of the stream and not by the manual release of water from the dams. How this project achieved a desirable species composition: Removal of the dams will allow the fish species to recover naturally over time. These fish will learn to navigate the waters for suitable habitat, take advantage of it and reproduce. Fish stock assessments were completed in 2004 by Kleinschmidt Associates that included electroshock surveys in dam impoundments and dam tail waters to understand the pre-removal population estimates. This data will be compared to post removal data collections. Post monitoring will report whether the system was able to self-heal and reach anticipated population rebounds. This data is still in the collection stage and currently initial reports have proven successful with many species returning with higher population numbers. How this project reinstated structural diversity (e.g. strata, faunal food webs, spatial habitat diversity): The increase in fish species populations will increase food sources for birds of prey, predatory fish, fish-eating mammals, scavengers and their competition with the human harvest. Examples of stressed species that would benefit from the increase in migratory prey fish are; bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), river otter (Lontra Canadensis) and belted kingfishers (Megaceryle alcyon). How this project recovered ecosystem functionality (e.g. nutrient cycling, plant-animal interactions, normal stressors): All taxa in the river will see an increase in available nutrients as there will eventually be a greater balance of decomposers, producers and predators. How this project reestablished external exchanges with the surrounding landscape (e.g. migration, gene flow, hydrology): With the natural recovery of the population it is expected that the gene pool will remain similar to its previous state. These populations experienced a population bottleneck where a loss of genes occurred caused by human interaction with the species. Migration routes for the 11 targeted species area now improved and will aid in maintaining optimal gene flow. 
Non-migratory freshwater fish and other taxa in the system will see an increase in gene flow as their meta populations will have greater connectivity and ability to reproduce with each other. Activities were undertaken to address any socio-economic aspects of the project: The loss of hydroelectric power initially was a threat, and in cooperation with the existing owners of the other dams, they increased generation of the remaining dams to fill the voids. This required the Penobscot River Restoration Trust to attend local town meetings and constantly present and educate the public on the benefits of the project. The shutting down of two dams worried those employees to fear for the termination of their employment. This is where the power company had to step in and promise them continued employment. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Two dams have been completely removed from the ecosystem, one major fish by-pass has been installed, and fish ladders have been implemented on many of the remaining dams on the river, greatly improving access for the migratory fish. Many dams will remain fragmenting the watershed and continue to restrict migration routes but they were outside the scope of the restoration. Reinstate appropriate physical conditions"",: The destruction of these dams has increased the flow of water and exposed sites of rapids unseen for centuries. Sediment and nutrient will now flow at a natural rate without an impoundment restriction for sediments and nutrients to settle behind. Achieve a desirable species composition: Only a few years since the removal of these dams a definitive population number for these stocks cannot be concluded. What we do know through the use of many visual count surveys is that many targeted species numbers have begun to increase showing promising results. Reinstate structural diversity: With the increase of fish biomass in the ecosystem, holes in the food web have been filled with a greater availability of food sources. This also allows for predatory apex species like the bald eagle to consume the migratory fish species that are lower in the food chain. Population success will aid in returning the food web to a pre-dam state that will improve its ability to be resilient to change. Recover ecosystem functionality: Predator - prey interactions will balance as the targeted populations increase, and predators of the fish increase. A surge of abundant prey will also benefit the species currently being consumed by apex predators by relieving predatory pressure improving their numbers. An example of this interaction is how bald eagles have resorted to preying on ducks and other waterfowl in the winter due to low numbers of migratory fish. Reestablish external exchanges with the surrounding landscape: The species of fish that are endangered and that saw severe decline during the life of the dams will now be emerging from a population bottleneck. Research is yet to be conducted on this topic. It can be anticipated that the genes that are current will persist with minor variations. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: After the removal of the two dams, the addition of improved fish ladders and the fish by-pass, it is now left up to the fish to find a way. The fish stocks still need to be monitored for recovery and enforcement of the fisheries needs to continue as residents may believe the removal of the dams will provide an instant surplus of harvestable fish. The remaining dams on the watershed will hinder the success of the recovery. These dams were out of the target range of the project due to budget limits and the importance of the electricity they produce.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: In the future, important commercial and recreational fish species will continue to improve and eventually be a source of income to these areas. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s 2010 economic report presented that the reconnection of the river would add $500 million in future benefits to the local economies. Increases in fish populations will also increase the recreational and commercial fishing industry as larger harvests will become sustainable and for-hire guide trips can become more frequent.
Provision of basic necessities such as food, water, timber, fiber, fuel, etc.: All targeted species populations are anticipated to  improve  resulting in larger harvests and  a more balanced ecosystem. Cultural dimensions such as recreational, aesthetic and/or spiritual: Freeing the river has already boosted recreational usage for water sports such as kayaking and canoeing; including the hosting of the American Canoe Association’s Whitewater Nationals Regatta. Through the increase of water sport races and competitions, there is hope it will help tourists discover these towns and the opportunities the river brings. The fish return will also support the Penobscot River Nation as the tribe has harvested salmon historically out of the river and have supported every stage of this project. It will aid in the traditions and culture of the values these people uphold and aid them economically. They have not harvested Atlantic salmon since the 1970’s showing support for the restoration of the species. These steps towards recovery bring pride to the people who once harvested salmon and give them hope for what is in store in the future. Regulation of climate, floods, disease, erosion, water quality, etc.: Water quality and sediment flow should  improve post dam removal.  Free flowing of the river  will improve  natural sediment flow. Has the project had any negative consequences for surrounding communities or given rise to new socio-economic or political challenges?: The loss of two power generating stations was a concern to the locals that purchased this relatively clean source of electricity. This loss of productivity worried consumers that it would result in increased electricity costs and shortages in the area. The solution to this issue was the increase in energy production at other dams upstream. Staffing from these lost dams were also a local worry and it was reported that staff levels were not expected to change during the project. These issues were a major counterargument towards stalling the restoration and only public education and communication helped ease the issue. One of the major outcomes of this restoration was the success of the ‘hands free’ approach. The river was left to repair and repopulate itself after the removal of the dams and the addition of the fish by-pass was complete. Dam removals can be fiscally burdening to stakeholders and it requires an unforeseen collaboration between local, state and government officials.  The press was a major key in the support of the project. Using the Penobscot River Restoration Trust’s website, one can easily access all publishing by major new sources including: The Bangor Daily News, CBS, Boston Globe, The New York Times, The Guardian, The Portland Press Herald and many other sources. The support from these news services aided in teaching locals and drawing attention to the idea. Without the widespread use of the media this project would have received less support. Long term management includes electric shock surveys of fish to compare the data to the pre-removal assessments that were completed by Kleinschmidt Associates back in 2004. Other tests include the pit tagging of salmon smelt, and water quality testing of macro-invertebrates. Continued visual surveys at fish ladders are important to monitor the distance the fish travel, and the success of these ladders for movement of the fish. Currently there are citizen scientists helping with the data collection alongside private and government monitoring. NOAA has its own long-term monitoring in place consisting of six major sections. Part of their initial funding for the project set aside money for their long-term study of the ecosystem. They are studying the visual change in channel morphology using set camera stations, as well as using permanent transects to test for changes in the channel geometry by measuring for elevation changes and bed sediment grain size. Water quality monitoring is also in effect checking for indicators in macroinvertebrate communities and chemical changes in the water post dam removal. Habitat and vegetation composition will be monitored with remote sensing and the current photographic stations set up for channel morphology. Fish passage and composition will take up a majority of their post monitoring data collection to determine the success of the project. Recording where these fish decide to reproduce will also give insights on life histories, abundance and timing of passage at the remaining dams. Lastly, they aim to monitor ecosystem function and how the increase of marine-derived nutrients will function in the food web and how other species respond to this. "

Provide opportunities for students and community members to be involved in forest stewardship and conservation work through a green infrastructure project; and
Perpetuate native Hawaiian cultural practices through the establishment of a Hawaiian cultural garden.
Agriculture & Livestock, Fire & Weather Events, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The forests in the mauka regions of the Central Ko’olau Mountains comprise some of the most important watersheds on the island of O’ahu. These watersheds rely on the presence of native plant species to efficiently capture and hold onto precipitation to consistently replenish underground aquifers with fresh water. This is true in both wet and dryland forest ecosystems, where traits of native plant species have evolved to suit their climatic conditions and efficiently retain the water. The forest in the mid to lower mauka sections have been degraded by agricultural practices and urban development. This projects seeks to restore 5.1 acres. This area is currently dominated by habitat-modifying weeds. It is suspected that this area was used for cattle ranching due to its flat ground. Our goal is to restore this area to a more native-dominated system to increase recharge capacity in this high priority watershed area. The reference ecosystem is based on diverse sources of information (e.g. multiple extant reference sites, field indicators, historical records, predictive data).

It’s probable that the occupation of the valley by sugar cane farms, coffee plantations and cattle fields promoted isolation between the Sea Mountains and the Mantiqueira Mountains over the last 300 years. The more recent industrialization and urban occupation of the valley has exacerbated this isolation.The company Eletrobrás FURNAS S.A, a regional public utility, has made investments in restoration projects in the area. Moving forward, it is essential to direct these projects to permanent protected areas (APP) and national parks, with the goal of connecting remaining fragments.In the Sea Mountains and Mantiqueira Mountains, there are two National Parks of imperative importance, the National Park of Itatiaia and the National Park of Bocaina Mountains. The objective of this project is to create an ecological corridor linking these two national parks using the APP of rivers and reservoir owned by Eletrobrás FURNAS S. A. This project identified the path of the corridor and calculated the necessary area of restoration of the ecological corridor.Agriculture & Livestock, Dams & Hydrology, Deforestation, Fragmentation, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The degradation of the South Paraíba river’s basin began early in  Brazil’s history, starting with the exploitation era of the Brazilian colony, where the gold route and creation sugar cane farms, coffee plantations and rice paddies degraded the meadows of the South Paraiba river. Later in the 1940s, the coffee production was replaced with cattle fields and eucalyptus plantations.
In addition to resource extraction and land use change, the area also functioned as a “natural path” through the interior of Brazil’s Southeast region. The 1951 inauguration of the President Dutra Highway,  connecting the capital cities São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, increased industrialization and real estate occupation in the region, factors that resulted in further environmental degradation. The reference ecosystem is primarily based on contemporary reference sites or existing analogues of the pre-degradation ecosystem.Six reference fragments were selected and categorized into three different successional stages, three age classes were set: Class 1 (young forests within 10 to 20 years), Class 2 (intermediate forests within 30 to 40 years) and Class 3 (older forests, with more than 60 years), each class had two fragments.
We sampled 3,460 trees classified in 39 families and 168 species. The older fragments (more than 60 years) of the reference ecosystem presented a higher richness of species then the fragments of 10 to 20 years old. The young fragments showed a higher rate of pioneer species 39.6%, followed by early secondary 48.9%, and late secondary 11.5%. The fragments within 30 to 40 years old showed 21.05% of pioneers, early secondary 64%, and late secondary 14.4%. Fragments with more than 60 years old presented 6.9% of pioneers, 54.4% of early secondary and late secondary 38.4%. In terms of forest structure, older fragments (more than 60 years old) showed a higher canopy height 10m +2, trees per parcel 88+2 and basal area 1.1m2/hectare +0.1 
Diagnose the situation of the area between the national parks using landscape metrics;
Propose a species list for the restoration that follows the composition of the referential ecosystem;
Propose an ecological corridor that uses the APP and connects the National Park of Itatiaia and the National Park of Bocaina Mountains.


The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Eletrobrás FURNAS S.A. have a nursery garden with capacity to produce 120,000 plants seedlings per year – all of them natives from the Atlantic Forest. This production can be streamlined to give the necessary support to the restoration of the priority area (ecological corridor). However, FURNAS is not the owner of all the APP that surrounds the reservoir, about 80% of this area is third party owned. One way to encourage public and private support of this restoration project would be promoting the corridor in an inclusive way.
With the promotion of this project, it is possible to attract private companies that may have an obligation to recover areas due environment debts, or those that have an interest in contributing to the first corridor between the Sea Mountains to the Mantiqueira Mountains and reconnecting fragments after 300 years of isolation.
The necessity of choosing species that are from the regional forest to achieve success on the recovery of plantations.
The chosen area to plant must be well delimited and should contemplate priority areas like the corridor, as well as those close to remaining fragments.
  The future directions must involve both national parks to collaborate with the maintenance of the corridor. This service should focus on the control of invasive species, fire, cattle and guarantee the respect of the corridor delimitation.
To expand the visibility of the project, it is necessary to involve the industrial companies from the region, that can assist with marketing campaigns, provide logistical/financial support and help with the implementation and maintenance of the corridor. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-california-marbled-murrelet-restoration-and-corvid-management-project-marbled-murrelet-land-acquisition-and-enhancement-project-central-california-coast-usa/	USA: California: Marbled Murrelet Restoration and Corvid Management Project/ Marbled Murrelet Land Acquisition and Enhancement Project, Central California Coast, USA	United States of America	2004-08-30	2009-08-30	"On the evening of September 26th, 1998, the marine vessel, M/V Command, illegally spilled an estimated 3,000 gallons of heavy fuel oil while in transit from San Francisco to Panama. The relatively small spill occurred at a time when high numbers of seabirds were in the vicinity with their young, resulting in significant injury of seabirds and other aquatic life. The spill affected the shoreline throughout San Mateo County with tarballs washing up as far south as the Salinas River. Approximately 1500 seabirds were killed, including an estimated 6-12 marbled murrelets, Brachyramphus marmoratus, (Boyce & Hampton 2002).Restoration funds were recovered from the responsible party under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA), the Oil Pollution Act (OPA), the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA), and other state law. A trustee council made up of five representative agencies, with lead roles designated to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the California Department of Parks and Recreation (CDPR), was established in order to assist in the design, implementation, permitting, monitoring, and oversight of restoration projects. The goal of these projects was to return injured natural resources to baseline conditions and if possible, compensate for the value of resources lost during the recovery period. A comprehensive restoration plan was developed and several seabird restoration and lost human use projects were implemented. This particular case study focuses on two projects benefitting the marbled murrelet, the Marbled Murrelet Restoration and Corvid Management Project (CMP) and the Marbled Murrelet Restoration Land Acquisition and Enhancement Project (LAEP).The CMP began in 2004 with the objective to increase murrelet population numbers by protecting their nesting habitat within the old-growth coniferous forests of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The Santa Cruz murrelets are a declining population of about 500 birds, and are thought to be the most endangered population of marbled murrelets on the North American West Coast. In addition to habitat protection, efforts to discourage corvids (specifically, Steller’s jays and common ravens) from predation of marbled murrelet eggs were instituted and have focused on reducing access to human food waste. California State Parks have implemented a public awareness campaign to educate state and county park visitors on the importance of proper food storage and waste disposal. They have also installed covered food waste receptacles and food storage lockers at the parks.Corvid and marbled murrelet populations were monitored in order to establish initial population numbers, gauge program effectiveness, and guide continuing efforts at corvid abatement. Corvid numbers in targeted areas have undergone a continuous and dramatic decline since the project was initiated. Despite these reductions, murrelet numbers continued to decline at historic rates, and the Santa Cruz Mountain population was in danger of local extirpation in 2009. However, as restoration efforts continued, stable trends in marbled murrelet numbers have been observed. Today, the corvid management project continues with funds from the Luckenbach oil spill and the Cosco Busan oil spill Trustee Councils.Additional restoration efforts include the Marbled Murrelet Restoration Land Acquisition and Enhancement Project, which focused on protecting nesting habitat. Settlement funds were used to purchase the Girl Scout Creek Property, an 80-acre forest within the Santa Cruz Mountains. This land was acquired in 2006 for the purpose of protection from development, and continues to show marbled murrelet presence each year (2007-2009), with possible nesting in 2007. The property is managed and maintained by Butano State Park.Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological) On September 26th, 1998, the M/V Command departed the San Francisco Bay along a southbound shipping lane when it discharged 3,000 gallons of IBF 380, also known as No. 6 fuel oil, into the ocean. Due to light winds and fair weather, the oil remained within the vicinity of the shipping lane, but began washing ashore within four days in the form of oily tarballs and tar patties. The affected area included 15 miles of beaches, primarily south of San Francisco in San Mateo County, reaching as far south as the Salinas River in Monterey County. The impact of the relatively small spill was amplified by the delay in its discovery and by occurring at a time when large numbers of seabirds typically assemble on the open ocean with their young to feed. 1500 seabirds in total were estimated to be killed. 171 birds were recovered by oil spill response workers. Most recovered birds suffered fatal injury including 11 sooty shearwaters, 6 brown pelicans, and 99 common murres. The Trustees employed mathematical modeling in determining the number of marbled murrelets likely at risk. Taking into account aerial survey monitoring at the time of the spill, the amount of shoreline inaccessible to searchers, and historical known oil spill mortality data, an estimated 6-12 marbled murrelets were killed, with 87 placed at risk (Boyce and Hampton 2002). At that time the affected local population was thought to have already been in a state of continuous decline since the early 1990’s due to a several factors including contaminants, predation, habitat loss, and availability of prey (Beissinger and Nur 1997). It was thought that without intervention, extinction could occur within 25 years (Beissinger and Nur 1997). Marbled murrelets of Central California are an integral member of a larger seabird community and are unique among seabirds in that their nesting habitat is located up to 20 miles inland, located in old growth coniferous forests, typically in stands of 100 acres or greater (Nelson 1997). The local population nesting within the Santa Cruz Mountains, an isolated population of approximately 500 birds, had been slowly declining from a number of factors including nest predation by corvids including Steller’s jays and common ravens (Peery et al. 2002, 2004). Historically, 95% habitat destruction of old growth redwood forests in the area through logging activities was a source of population decline, though most remaining old growth coniferous forests are now protected inside California parks. Marbled murrelets are listed as Threatened by the U.S. Government per the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Endangered by the State of California. The estimated world population is 263,000 to 841,000 individuals (Nelson 1997). However, population estimates for the listed population (i.e., Washington, Oregon and California) are less than 20,000, including fewer than 500 in the Santa Cruz Mountains (USFWS 2009). In accordance with OPA (15 C.F.R., Part 990), the overall goal of restoration is to address the impacts to natural resources from injury by returning them to their pre-spill (baseline) conditions, as well as to compensate for interim losses of resources. Given that the marbled murrelet population of the Santa Cruz Mountains is a small, isolated population, with dwindling numbers, it was determined the population was not likely to be reestablished without human assistance (Peery et al. 2002, 2004). This restoration was implemented through a combination of habitat protection and predator abatement measures. The long-term goal is to protect and insulate marbled murrelets of Central California from local extirpation.

A trustee council made up of five representative agencies including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), the California Department of Parks and Recreation (CDPR), and the California State Lands Commission (CSLC) was established in order to oversee the design, selection, implementation, and oversight of restoration projects. The California Department of Parks and Recreation (CDPR) assumed a primary role in projects involving marbled murrelet restoration. A final version of the restoration plan and environmental assessment was released in June 2004, following public comment and review (Appendix A, USFWS 2004). Restoration work, with oversight by the Trustees, has been carried out through the CDPR under the direction of a project manager, in partnership with state and county parks of the Santa Cruz Mountains and with assistance from additional public and private institutions.

Description of Project Activities: Research and PlanningPredation by corvids was considered by experts to be one of the greatest threats to the Santa Cruz murrelet population. This was based upon several factors: corvids had moved into the Santa Cruz Mountains attracted by human food waste left accessible at parks and campgrounds; several parks (Butano State Park, Pescadero Creek County Park, Big Basin State Park, Portola State Park and Memorial County Park) are located near murrelet nesting habitat; and predation by corvids on other species had been observed and documented (Boarman 2002). Studies had shown that limiting accessible human food waste in parks to be a successful technique of natural predator abatement. Reducing corvid numbers through proper waste management was considered a strategy that could potentially mitigate murrelet population declines with a reasonable expectation of success.
Acquisition of private lands known to contain murrelet nesting habitat for proper conservation management and stewardship was a proven strategy of protecting bird habitat. Additionally, as younger stands of conifer on these lands mature, murrelet nesting habitat will expand. Past efforts of murrelet protection has focused primarily on acquisition. The addition of corvid management further increased the likelihood of success in protecting the murrelet population (Hampton, pers. com.).
In order to develop and refine a successful murrelet restoration strategy, it was necessary to monitor murrelet as well as corvid numbers. Local information was needed regarding corvids including bird frequency within target areas, reference information from control sites, and observation of flight behavior. Monitoring of marbled murrelets, which poses challenges due to their small size and inherently reclusive nature, was done with a combination of surveying techniques. The primary means consisted of audio-visual surveys, which took place throughout areas of interest within the parks in order to monitor trends in bird population as well as nesting behavior over time. The audio-visual surveys were supplemented with periodic at-sea surveys, which are useful in determining overall population numbers. As a third measure, radar surveys were conducted throughout the five relevant parks, to provide a more complete picture of murrelet activity including flight behavior. At-sea surveys included monitoring for juvenile birds. Combined, these monitoring reports were used to guide management decisions in restoring the depleted population.
ImplementationIn the late summer of 2003, work commenced in pre-implementation monitoring of sites for the purpose of gauging both corvid and murrelet numbers in order to establish baseline data. These efforts represented a continuation of marbled murrelet population data collection dating back to 1988 (Shaw 2011). In 2004 the Damage Assessment and Restoration Plan was finalized and efforts at corvid management began to be implemented, first in state parks and later in county parks. A project manager was identified and education/outreach materials were developed, including brochures and signs, which were distributed as staff began the work of educating park visitors. In 2005, focused efforts were made to have most project elements in place prior to the commencement of the local camping season. By Memorial Day, state parks had augmented trained seasonal staff, signs were installed on picnic tables with other educational materials in place, limited removal of ravens was underway, and some covered trash receptacles were installed. For the remainder of 2005 and throughout 2006 implementation continued. Efforts included: further installation of garbage protection, the selective removal of 24 ravens from campground sites, and park-wide education/awareness campaign efforts, with new materials, camper surveys, and completion of an educational outreach video to be shown at two visitor centers. In 2007 the video presentation was installed, the refitting of approximately 40 dumpsters at Big Basin Redwoods State Park with animal-proof lids was finished, and the installation of a shed to protect and cover a local garbage storage and transportation truck was completed. After a period of delay, the replacement of approximately 90 uncovered trash cans with covered receptacles in Memorial County Park was completed as well.
On March 20th, 2006, escrow closed on the Girl Scout Creek Property which became part of Butano State Park. Beginning in 2007 and continuing to date, a management plan was developed and audio-visual surveys were conducted on the property to monitor murrelet numbers, presence of juveniles, and nesting behaviors. M/V Command funds have been fully expended and these activities continue with funds from other oil spill trustee counsels.
In addition to surveys at the 80-acre parcel, monitoring of both corvids and murrelets was done throughout state and county parks, as well as at-sea surveys for murrelets. Surveys were used to estimate population numbers, assess trends between years, and assist in determining juvenile ratios which is the estimate of productivity commonly used to index reproductive success in marbled murrelets. Beginning in 2004, corvid numbers were monitored annually as project elements were implemented. Monitoring was conducted monthly May through August at four camping areas and at several reference sites located away from camp sites for comparison. Monitoring of marbled murrelets within the Big Basin, Portola, and Butano State Parks as well as Memorial County Park, was done in a similar fashion from 2004-2011, taking surveys at 11 established bird monitoring stations near campgrounds multiple times over the breeding season (Shaw 2011). In addition to audio-visual surveys of murrelets, aerial at-sea photographic censuses were conducted in order to determine and assess trends of overall numbers of marbled murrelets and juvenile ratios. Finally, radar monitoring, which had originally begun in 1999 and continued through 2009, was conducted within the five watersheds of the Santa Cruz Mountains to gain supplemental information regarding nesting murrelet numbers and inland flight patterns.
Following these efforts a period of adaptive management began, and throughout 2007-2010 education efforts were renewed at Big Basin, Butano, and Portola State Parks, as well as Memorial County Park. Food locker and dumpster improvements were made at Memorial County Park, garbage collection at Big Basin Park was improved and some food lockers were installed in state parks, along with a more focused removal of ravens.
In 2011, with Command Trustee Council funds 99% expended, the Corvid Management Project continued with funds from both the Luckenbach Trustee Council and in 2013, from the Cosco Busan Trustee Council. Under Luckenbach funding, 240 new food lockers were added to Big Basin Redwoods and Butano State Parks, as well as Memorial County Park in 2011. Through further research, it was found that certain types of signs and messaging had greater effectiveness, and a renewed “Crumb Clean” campaign was initiated.
Additionally, in 2009, amidst concerns from experts that the local murrelet population may still be in decline, funding began for research by Humboldt State University involving “conditioned taste aversion”, or CTA. CTA involves the placement of decoy murrelet eggs injected with a tasteless, odorless chemical that induces discomfort and/or vomiting after ingestion by corvids. After encouraging preliminary results supporting decreases in corvid predation on decoy eggs, CTA was implemented in the parks through funding from the Cosco Busan Trustee Council, and continues to date. These efforts began in Portola and Butano State Parks with the deployment of 550 decoy eggs, showing a 37-72% reduction in attacks on murrelet-mimic eggs compared to control eggs (Gabriel and Golightly 2011). CTA has continued in Portola and Butano State Parks, and has recently begun in Big Basin State Park as well as Memorial County Park.
In 2013, a lawsuit was filed against the California Department of Parks and Recreation by the Center for Biological Diversity, challenging the adequacy of Big Basin State Park’s new management plan in adequately protecting the marbled murrelet under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the California Endangered Species Act (CESA). In 2014 a settlement was reached in which further protections will be afforded after Trustee Council funding is completely expended within Big Basin, Butano, and Portola State Parks. These protections include additional improvements to trash management, continued public outreach, along with continued monitoring and a comprehensive assessment every three years. The settlement stipulates that further action will be taken should murrelet numbers continue to decline.
Education and OutreachThe Corvid Management and Restoration Project has provided many unique opportunities to enhance public knowledge and raise awareness of the threat to the local marbled murrelet population. Roving “crumb patrols” and a “Crumb Clean” campaign have created opportunities for sharing information with visitors. A short video was developed with cooperation between Big Basin and Butano State Parks to educate the public. Viewing the video is now a requirement for park visitors. Other materials have included brochures developed for campers and picnickers along with signs installed throughout the park, including on picnic tables, trash disposal areas, and in bathrooms. Further education took place through public presentations, news coverage, and park web sites.
ResultsThe primary marker of success for the Corvid Management Project has been declining numbers of corvids within campground areas in comparison to control sites. In this regard, eleven years of continuous efforts have demonstrated positive outcomes. Initial results of annual surveys in 2006 following the first year of full project implementation showed that numbers of corvids and jays throughout areas of human use had dropped dramatically, a trend that has consistently continued over time. In a 2013 survey of Stellar’s jays, a maximum average number of jays per hectare of 1.43 or lower was documented.  This reflects a decline in jay numbers which ranged from 4.4 per hectare in Portola State Park to as high as 14.2 per hectare in Memorial County Park in 2003.
At-sea surveys of the marbled murrelet conducted in 2007 uncovered a concerning decline in murrelet population and unchanged juvenile ratios compared to 2003 survey results. A five year review of the species found that despite abatement efforts, the Santa Cruz Mountain population was continuing to experience near-zero reproduction and was declining at a rate of about 15 percent per year, consistent with the annual adult mortality rate (USFWS 2009). Amidst concerns, a panel of marbled murrelet experts was convened in 2009, and renewed corvid abatement efforts were set in place, including implementation of the conditioned taste aversion studies. These renewed efforts have been followed by encouraging results. Two juveniles were detected in 2009, and for 2010 and 2011, juvenile rates of .074 and .091 were documented.  These values reflect about seven to nine juveniles per one hundred pairs of adult birds, the highest numbers to be recorded. While juvenile ratios nearer to 0.2 or higher would be considered ideal as an indicator of stability, surveying continues to demonstrate increased population numbers through at-sea surveys, as well as increased attendance patterns within the nesting habitat of state and county parks.
Additionally, under the Land Acquisition Project, monitoring has continued to detect marbled Mmurrelet activity within the Girl Scout Creek Property, with possible nesting behavior recorded in 2007. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The Santa Cruz marbled murrelet population in 2003 was found to be 699 birds with a juvenile ratio of .049, and a total average number of detections across State Parks at 84.8 birds. In 2008, population numbers had declined to 168 with a juvenile ratio of 0.00 and an average total number of detections to reach a low of 20.4 in 2009. With some fluctuation in numbers thought to be attributable to possible source sinking of birds to other locations outside the range of the survey, or immigration from northern populations, numbers have since continued to reflect an overall steady trend of improvement, with populations as of 2014 numbering 437, a juvenile ratio of .081, and average total detections of 124.3. While encouraging, it is thought that a juvenile ratio of near .20 or higher is needed to provide a strong indicator of population sustainability (Hampton, per. com.). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The Central California marbled murrelet population stability is thought to be affected by a range of anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic factors. Small oil spills continue to occur in major oil shipping routes throughout the California coast.
Raptors including owls and hawks, natural predators of the murrelet, continue to be detected in small numbers in surveys of the Santa Cruz Mountains. While efforts show dramatic corvid declines in camp sites, jays and ravens continue to be attracted to the area due to the abundance of local food sources nearly surrounding the Santa Cruz Mountains, including Ox Mountain landfill near Half Moon Bay, Santa Cruz County landfill, and nearby agricultural fields along the coast.
While past logging of murrelet habitat has contributed to reduced habitat and population declines, there are enough areas of protected habitat on Federal and State lands to effectively protect murrelet habitat, with significant stands maturing into old growth forest over the next 50-100 years to provide a substantially increased nesting potential, although seasonal wildfires remain a threat to forests of Central California.
Global climate change may impact future populations of marbled murrelets in the region, with warming trends and ocean conditions associated with El Niño affecting foraging conditions, including algal blooms, fishery depletion, and/or fishery migrations. 

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The Marbled Murrelet and Corvid Management Project created a unique opportunity for local community involvement. Volunteers from various organizations have helped to spread the message of corvid management and the importance of maintaining balance within the ecosystem, including the food webs of the central California coastal marine environment as well as the coniferous forests of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Beginning in 2005, roving “crumb patrols” have traversed parks, including groups of Boy Scouts delivering “report cards” to visitors on site cleanliness. A campfire program including a skit with audience participation and puppets began, encouraging campers and picnickers to do their part. The project’s “Crumb Clean” campaign has imparted visitors to State and County Parks in the Central California area of an increased awareness of their potential human impact, positive or negative, on the environment.
Trustees have found continued corvid management efforts at limiting human food access to be highly successful in dramatically reducing local populations of Stellar’s jay. However, continued decreases in murrelet numbers until 2008 and into 2009 have demonstrated that garbage protection, limited raven removal, and education efforts alone may not be sufficient to guarantee the success of the murrelet population. Researchers at Humboldt State University have found success in conditioned taste aversion (CTA) studies, which are demonstrating a seasonal decrease in the number of predated decoy eggs after CTA deployments. Further efforts, time, and monitoring will be necessary in order to gauge ultimate project success in stabilizing the population. "

Restoration activities included the removal of substantial volumes of fill consisting of sand, gravel, concrete and solid waste debris from the site, as well as the physical removal of approximately 0.2 acres of common reed (Phragmites australis). Each of the fill removal areas was excavated to sub-grade, backfilled with clean soils, and planted with native wetland and coastal upland plant species.As part of the NRDA settlement, a 5-year monitoring program was implemented to assess the extent of success of the restoration project. Performance criteria were established and a reference marsh, located 600 feet to the northeast of the restoration site was selected. The reference marsh was also a fringing marsh and of similar size as the restoration site.Monitoring results indicate that restoration performance has been successful in reestablishing a salt marsh community similar to the nearby reference marsh community. The planted salt marsh grasses are well established and flowering. The coastal shoreline zone in particular, had greater native marsh vegetation cover than in previous years. Fish, benthic, and avian communities at Bar Beach are comparable or trending toward those of the reference site, although it is recognized that marsh restoration may require multiple decades to achieve the full functionality of natural, unaltered wetlands. All of the performance criteria specifications had been met when monitoring was completed.The information presented in this case study reproduces and draws heavily upon the restoration plan (Attachment 1) developed by the Trustees and monitoring reports produced by The Louis Berger Group through a NOAA contract task order.Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological) The Applied Environmental Services (AES) Superfund Site is a 3.2 – acre site located at Glenwood Landing, Nassau County, New York, on part of a peninsula surrounded by the waters of Motts Cove and the eastern shore of Hempstead Harbor, a sub-estuary of Long Island Sound. Since 1939, numerous petrochemical operators had used the site for disposal. Beginning in 1974, part of the property was used for distribution and storage of chemical solvents. Between 1980 and 1983, a hazardous waste facility operated on the site. AES accepted many types of hazardous waste, including waste oil, chlorinated organic solvents, acids, paints, benzene, toluene, heavy metals and a variety of other organic chemical compounds. Shore Realty and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) performed a site cleanup during 1985 and 1986. Clean-up activities included removing hazardous waste stored in drums, containers and tanks contaminated with toluene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Subsequently, the site was designated as a federal Superfund site in 1986. In 1991, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) selected a remedy to directly address contaminants in the groundwater and soils of the site, thereby indirectly addressing contaminants migrating to the sediments, surface water, and air.
Releases of site-related hazardous substances were documented. Sampling demonstrated the presence of toxic levels of volatile organic compounds, semi-volatile organic compounds and metals in the aquatic environment. Bioassessment results indicated that leachate migrating from the site adversely impacted estuarine biota in Motts Cove and the Harbor. The greatest impact has occurred in the mudflats and saltmarsh adjacent to the AES Site on Hempstead Harbor. Approximately 2 to 3 acres of mudflat and saltmarsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) were severely impacted as a result of site releases.
Bar Beach Lagoon lies 0.6 km northwest across Hempstead Harbor and was the location chosen for off-site restoration to compensate for natural resources and services that were lost or adversely affected by releases from the AES Superfund Site. The fringing wetland at this location had been degraded by urban filling, erosion, and invasive plant colonization. This 5-acre tidal cove is located on the western shore of Hempstead Harbor, immediately east of West Shore Road in Port Washington, New York, and across the harbor from the Applied Environmental Services (AES) site. The project area consists of a mosaic of intertidal mudflat, sandflat, patchy low salt marsh dominated by smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), and shellfish beds dominated by ribbed mussel (Modiolus demissus) and eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica).
The Hempstead Harbor mudflats and marshes provide important spawning, nursery and foraging areas for numerous aquatic species. Anadromous, catadromous, euryhaline and marine finfish and invertebrates use the Harbor and Motts Cove; some of these species have commercial and recreational value (NOAA, 1991). The importance of these waters to the aquatic community is demonstrated by the fact that they have been designated as Essential Marine Habitat for 15 species by the NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS, 2000).
Hampstead Harbor, along with the waters of Manhasset Bay and Little Neck Bay to the east and adjoining portions of Nassau County shoreline are significant habitat areas for wintering waterfowl and wading birds. This area supports an average of more than 10,000 scaup (a migratory waterfowl species), representing 26% of New York’s wintering population (National Audubon Society, 1998). The Harbor also supports significant numbers of canvasback, and American black duck, along with Canada goose, brant, common goldeneye, oldsquaw, bufflehead, red-breasted merganser, and American widgeon. Restoration activities were deemed necessary as natural recovery to baseline conditions in Motts Cove and the Hempstead Harbor inlet adjacent to the AES Superfund site was not expected in the short-term, and possibly the long-term. This is because intertidal elevations in this area were not conducive to sustainability and survival of salt marsh vegetation that otherwise might naturally colonize available substrate.
The restoration project’s primary goal was to compensate for natural resources and services that were lost or adversely affected by releases from the site. Restoring the ecologically similar habitat at the site across the harbor from the injured wetland communities provided compensation for the loss of ecological services. The restored wetland has improved fish and shellfish habitat and detrital export function of this tidal community. It also attracts migratory birds including wading birds, shorebirds, waterfowl and passerines. These resources are similar to those injured at the site. In addition, the project has provided an opportunity for the public to enjoy this ecosystem due to its proximity to the Bar Beach Park and Hempstead Harbor Shoreline Trail.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Under the provisions/authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) on behalf of the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) were designated as natural resource trustees. The Trustees act on behalf of the public to investigate releases of hazardous substances, establish liability, assess injury to natural resources, seek damages from responsible parties, and ensure that funds recovered from responsible parties are used soley to restore, replace, or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. In August 1992, the State of New York, the United States, and the Performing Parties Group (the “PPG”which includes cooperating past and current owners, operators, and generators) entered into a Consent Judgment settling claims under CERCLA relating to the existence, release, or threat of release of hazardous substances at or from the site. Under this judgment, the PPG was required to perform remedial activities, pay natural resource damages and perform or fund restoration activities to settle their liability under CERCLA.
The Trustee negotiations with the PPG led to a settlement that funded restoration implementation and restoration monitoring to compensate for injuries to natural resources at the AES. The Trustees identified and evaluated a suite of restoration alternatives. Restoration plans were reviewed by experts from industry, agency restoration scientists, and interested members of the public. Offsite restoration of portions of a 5-acre salt marsh in Bar Beach Lagoon (across the harbor from AES) was chosen instead of salt marsh restoration adjacent to AES because it was deemed more sustainable than restoration adjacent to the site.
Decisions guiding restoration implementation and monitoring were developed as a part of a settlement agreement and subsequent modifications between the Trustees and responsible parties. The monitoring program was developed collaboratively by the Trustees.

Description of Project Activities: Salt Marsh Restoration

This task involved removing pea gravel and other non-native fill material from a peninsula in the northwest corner of the tidal cove.  An area of approximately 0.15 acres of low saltmarsh had been filled in this location.  An average 3- to 3.5-foot excavation depth was needed to return this area to appropriate intertidal elevations capable of supporting the growth and colonization of planted smooth cordgrass and other native salt marsh vegetation. 

A topographic survey tied into vertical benchmarks with known tidal datum was performed.   More than 3,000 cubic yards of fill material was excavated using a backhoe and front end loader.  Before beginning excavation a silt fence was installed at mean high water (MHW) to minimize sedimentation to the nearby marsh and saltflat.  The peninsula was subgraded 6 inches and backfilled with clean plantable soils to avoid gravel or other debris in the final grade elevation.  More than 6,000 low and high marsh plugs [smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), salt meadow grass (Spartina patens), and spike grass (Distichlis spicata)] were planted in the final graded area by local volunteers in 2003.  An additional 2,000 plugs were planted in the high marsh and spring tide zones in 2004.
  
Coastal Shoreline Restoration 
 
This task involved removing and regrading the northern shore of the tidal cove, which consisted of removal of concrete rubble, other solid waste debris, and fill historically placed in this location as part of the construction of the adjacent parking area for Bar Beach Park.  The specific shoreline area addressed was approximately 400 feet long.  Fill was removed and the coastal bank was regraded using clean soil and then stabilized with plantings of native wetland and coastal upland plant species.

The work involved excavating debris and regrading an area of approximately 0.25 acres.  Silt fencing was properly installed at mean high water (MHW) before excavation began.  A backhoe was used to complete the excavation, caution was exercised to prevent significant disturbance to the low saltmarsh community at and below MHW.  Where possible, rubble was removed manually.
  
When debris/poor soils were encountered, these locations were subgraded to a maximum depth of 1 foot below final grade and backfilled with clean, plantable soils to the depicted final grades.  Once the excavation and grading was complete, the coastal bank area was covered with jute mesh to minimize erosion.  A rapid-germinating, salt-tolerant seed mix was applied to minimize potential erosion.
  
Once all grading was completed, shrubs, trees and emergent plants were installed to approximate a zoned coastal shoreline community.  Native species and regional stock were used and included beach plum (Prunus maritima), groundsel tree (Baccharis halimofolia), high tide bush (Iva frutescens), switch grass (Panicum virgatum), and seaside goldenrod (Solidago sempervirens).
  
Invasive Plant Control

This task involved removing and controlling common reed (Phragmites australis), an invasive, undesirable species that dominated the western and southwestern portions of the tidal cove shoreline.  This invasive plant had taken over the relatively narrow high marsh (irregularly flooded) zone within the tidal cove and varied from 10 to 50+ feet wide.  Its colonization and growth was attributed to freshwater inputs (groundwater and surface runoff) from the upland slopes immediately adjacent to the marsh.  Phragmites is generally intolerant of pore-water salinity levels greater than 20 parts per trillion (ppt), and is generally intolerant of regular flooding by full-salinity seawater.

The control of Phragmites at this site, within an area of approximately 0.2 acres, was accomplished through excavation activities that removed roots and rhizomes and lowered the substrate elevation, thereby decreasing the suitability of the addressed habitat for recolonization by Phragmites.  Some manual removal was undertaken in subsequent years.  These activities also increased natural colonization by desirable species and decreased the available seed stock and rhizomes of Phragmites extending into other restored areas of the Bar Beach Lagoon.  A rapid-germinating seed mix was applied to upland disturbed areas to prevent erosion.  More than 8,000 plugs of Spartina, other high- and low-marsh species, and upland species were planted after meeting the specifications for the final grading in 2003 and 2004. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Permanent shoreline transects and saltmarsh plots were chosen for assessments.  Photographs of each area were taken at designated locations.  Measurements were collected to assess the extent of plant survival and growth and improvement in marsh functions.  The assessments included one reference location in the vicinity of the restoration project (Attachment 2).  Specifically the components monitored were survival and growth of the salt marsh and shoreline plantings, physical stability of substrate, and surveys of macroinvertebrates, fish and birds using the marsh and stabilized shoreline.  The performance criteria for the restoration project were: (1) 90% survival of Spartina alterniflora plantings after two full growing seasons; (2) 90% survival of planted shoreline vegetation after two full growing seasons; (3) 85% cover of the restoration area (marsh and stabilized coastal shoreline) within 5 years of initial planting; (4) minimal re-establishment of Phragmites australis and other undesirable invasive vegetation to 10% or less of the total restored area; and (5) species abundance, richness, and composition of macroinvertebrates, fish, and birds similar to (i.e. demonstrating strong positive trend toward or not significantly different from) reference marsh.

Monitoring results indicated that the restoration efforts have been successful in establishing a diverse population of salt marsh plant and animal species.  The planted salt marsh grasses were well established and flowering.  The coastal shoreline zone has a dense cover of native grasses and shrubs.  Three years after initial planting, the restoration site met the 85% native species vegetative cover, 90% survival, and the <10% re-establishment of invasive plant species requirements.  In year five, mean vegetative cover was 90.6% compared with 22.5% prior to restoration.  Invasive species (Phragmites) cover approximately 1.0% of the restoration site area, as compared to 25% pre-restoration.  The avian abundance, richness and diversity at the restoration site was higher than the nearby reference site although these conditions may reflect in part the configuration and location of the fringe marsh reference site and proximity to a public parking lot.  Over the 5-year monitoring period, 49 bird species were recorded in the restoration area compared to 24 in the reference area.  These differences were attributed to the difference in habitat surrounding the restoration and reference sites.  The density, abundance, and diversity of the fish component of the nektonic community at the restoration site were slightly lower than that of the reference site, while grass shrimp abundance and density were higher at the restoration site.  The macroinvertebrate community, dominated by ribbed mussels and mud snail was more diverse at the restoration site than the reference site, whereas species richness was the same for the two sites, and abundance was considerably lower at the restoration site than at the reference site.  Lower abundance of macro-invertebrates in the restoration site was most likely due to mature substrate and the presence of well-established beds of ribbed mussels and higher densities of mud snails at the reference site. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The stipulations outlined in the performance criteria have been met by the restoration.  Ecological recovery of the restoration site is on a trajectory towards the conditions measured and demonstrated at the reference site.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The restored mudflats and marshes provide important spawning, nursery and foraging areas for numerous aquatic species some of which have commercial and recreational value.  Both songbirds and waterbirds utilize the restoration site providing wildlife viewing opportunities. In addition, the project has provided an opportunity for the public to enjoy this ecosystem due to its location within the Bar Beach Park and close proximity to the Hempstead Harbor Shoreline Trail.
Additional plantings were needed to augment the initial plantings where mortality, erosion, and fill compaction occurred. Switch grass (Panicum virgatum) plugs were planted in the upland to address areas that did not respond well to initial seeding due to droughty banks soils. Herbivore-exclusion fencing was also erected to protect new plantings until they were well established and could withstand grazing. The town of Northhempstead applied glyphosate herbicide in 2008 to eradicate some recolonizing Phragmites and manually removed multiflora rose, Japanese knotweed, Norway maple, and common mugwort. They also installed more than 100 native shrubs and 1,500 grass plugs to further minimize the spread of invasive plants. Control of non-native invasive plant species (e.g., mugwort, common reed, Japanese knotweed muliflora rose, porcelainberry, Norway maple) will need to be pursued aggressively on an annual basis or these species will most likely re-colonize and/or expand throughout the site.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-rhode-island-north-cape-bird-restoration-block-island-sound/	USA: Rhode Island: North Cape Bird Restoration, Block Island Sound	United States of America	2001-01-01	2009-01-01	"In January of 1996 the tank barge, North Cape, struck ground off the coast of Rhode Island spilling approximately 828,000 gallons of No. 2 heating oil into Block Island Sound. The results of over 30 studies of potential resource injuries caused by the spill were reviewed and a variety of experts in relevant scientific and technical disciplines were consulted. Based on this work, it was believed that the spill caused significant injuries to biota in the offshore and salt pond environments and to a variety of birds. Under the natural resource damage assessment provisions of the Oil Pollution Act, a trustee council, made up of representatives of Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), was established to review, select, and oversee implementation of restoration actions for natural resources injured by the spill. A comprehensive restoration plan was developed and projects were implemented for birds, shellfish, and American lobster. Projects were also implemented to restore alewife runs in the salt pond watersheds as compensation for lost recreational fishing opportunities, and open space lands have been protected to compensate for losses to other marine and salt pond organisms. This particular case study focuses on the bird restoration project which was an effort to restore loons, sea ducks, and piping plover populations.
Over 2,000 birds, including numerous loons and sea ducks, were estimated to have been killed by the North Cape oil spill (Sperduto et al. 2003). The piping plover, a federally listed threatened species, was impacted by reductions to its food base. The goal of the restoration was to fully address the impacts to birds by returning injured natural resources to their pre-spill conditions as well as compensate for interim losses of the bird resources. This was attempted by replacing the quantity of bird-years (direct mortality plus foregone production) lost due to the spill. Aspects of the restoration included enhancing reproductive success of loons, eiders and piping plovers through land purchase to protect nesting sites, nesting bird protection and management activities, and monitoring. These efforts have lead to the permanent protection of nearly 1.5 million acres of Maine forests and lakes that provide nesting habitat for at least 125 loon pairs, permanent protection of Flag Island, a 42 acre island in Casco Bay, Maine that is home to more than 600 pairs of nesting common eiders and an increase in nesting piping plovers from 35 pairs on nine beaches in 2000 to 58 pairs on 11 beaches in 2006. In addition, the results from the monitoring have aided in developing effective methods for restoration and management of these bird populations.Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological) On January 19, 1996, during a severe winter storm, the tank barge North Cape, carrying 94,000 barrels (3.9 million gallons) of two blends of No. 2 home heating oil, struck ground off Moonstone Beach in South Kingstown, Rhode Island and began to leak oil into the surrounding water. Winds reaching 50 knots formed large, breaking waves that dispersed the oil throughout the water column and into contact with bottom sediments resulting in high concentrations of toxic components (i.e. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) in the shallow waters near shore (French McCay, 2003). A second winter storm five days later brought the oil, which had been dissipating, back into the sensitive intertidal zone, resulting in substantial mortality of marine organisms (Gibson et al, 1997). In total, an estimated 828,000 gallons of the fuel oil were released into the coastal and offshore environments before the North Cape was refloated and moved to Newport, Rhode Island on Friday, January 26, one week after grounding.
The trustees reviewed the results of over 30 studies of potential resource injuries cause by the spill and consulted with a variety of experts in relevant scientific and technical disciplines. Based on this work, the trustees believed that the spill caused significant injuries to biota in the offshore and salt pond environments and to a variety of birds. While the effect of the oil spill was extensive, this case study is focused on the bird mortality and subsequent population restoration.
Injury quantification for bird resources began with an estimate of the number of seabird and wintering waterfowl killed as a result of the incident, as well as information describing the size and age of these animals. To arrive at an estimate of total bird mortality, an acute mortality multiplier, based on a qualitative analysis of factors influencing oil spill-related bird mortality (Attachment 2), was applied to the number of water birds known to have died as a result of the oil spill. This multiplier accounts for birds that were never found because they sank, drifted out to sea or were scavenged (Hlady and Burger, 1993). The methods used to derive the value of the acute mortality multiplier used for the North Cape oil spill are described in detail in Sperduto et al (1997).
Once the magnitude of the injury was established, the recovery time for the resource to return to baseline condition was estimated. Recovery time estimates (Attachment 2) were based on life history and population information for each injured bird species, straightforward calculations and best professional judgment (Sperduto et al, 1999). Multiplying the recovery time by the number of individuals affected by the spill provided an estimate of the total direct bird injury. The total direct bird injury for each species group was as follows: marine birds with recovery period greater than one year (4,025 bird-years), marine birds with recovery period equal to one year (606 bird-years), non-water birds (12 bird-years), and pond birds (198 bird-years). The estimate of indirect bird injuries included the lost bird-years associated with the first generation of fledglings that would have been produced by marine birds with recovery periods greater than one year (scoters, mergansers, goldeneye, bufflehead, eider, loons and grebes) and the sum of lost bird-years in the future discounted by an annual rate of three percent (present value estimate of lost bird-years). Based on this approach the estimated total bird loss amounted to 6,275 bird-years. Losses were greatest for loons (2,920 bird-years) and eider (853 bird-years). Details of this calculation are provided in Sperduto et al (2003).
In addition to seabirds and wintering waterfowl, the piping plover, a federally listed threatened species was adversely affected by the North Cape oil spill. To assess injury to piping plovers nesting within the spill impacted area (Moonstone Beach), behavior and productivity of these birds during 1996 was compared to historical and reference area data. This comparison indicated that Moonstone Beach plovers experienced lower productivity than expected and exhibited unusual behavior consistent with reduced food supply and reproductive impairment. A first generation loss was estimated to be approximately five piping plover chicks (Donlan et al. 2003). The salt pond and offshore habitats of the Block Island Sound coastal ecosystem provide nesting and foraging habitat for a host of resident and migratory bird species. During the winter months, marine waters support seabird and waterfowl populations including loons and grebes, sea ducks (e.g. eiders and scoters), and diving ducks (e.g. goldeneye, bufflehead, and scaup). Wintering diving ducks and dabbling ducks such as scaup, American black duck and mallard also inhabit the area’s salt ponds. Over 200 species of migratory birds use Block Island Sound resources during the spring and autumn months. Several species of birds (e.g. black ducks and loons) are of special importance to wildlife managers because their populations are declining and/or their ranges are retracting.
Common Loon
Breeding common loon (Gavia immer) populations in the northeastern U.S. have experienced severe historical declines and range retractions. Common loons rely on the Block Island Sound ecosystem for wintering habitat. Experts believe that loons wintering off the coast of Rhode Island breed in northern New England (Maine) and southern Canada. Although Maine’s breeding loon population is currently robust and estimated at 1,400 pairs (Evers, 2007), major stressors continue to pose a threat. These stressors include both the availability of methylmercury (MeHg) in freshwater environments (Evers et al, 1998; Evers, 2000) and oil spills in marine environments. Loons are recognized as a species of management concern by the USFWS, and are highly sensitive to human disturbance and have low nesting and hatching success in habitats encroached upon by human development (Crowley et al, 1996). The state of Vermont has listed common loons as an endangered species; in New Hampshire they are listed as a threatened species; and in Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York they are listed as a species of concern.
Piping Plover
Piping plovers (Charadrius melodus), a federally listed threatened species, were common along the Atlantic Coast during much of the 19th century, but nearly disappeared due to excessive hunting for the millinery trade. Following passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918, numbers recovered to a 20th Century peak which occurred in the 1940s. The current population decline is attributed to increased development and recreational use of beaches since the end of World War II. The most recent surveys place the Atlantic population at less than 1,800 pairs (USFWS, 2007). The Block Island Sound ecosystem provides particularly valuable habitat for piping plover. These southern beaches contain the largest piping plover nesting area in the state. In the summer of 1996, nine pairs of piping plovers nested on Moonstone Beach near the site of the North Cape grounding, and five pairs nested on Ninigret Beach.
Common Eider
Common eiders (Somateria mollissima) have experienced a tremendous population increase during the last 100 years. In the early 1900s, market hunting, egg collecting, and year-round shooting had suppressed numbers so that there were only a few nesting pairs in Maine in 1907 (Gross, 1944; Goudie et al, 2000). Allen (2005) reported a population high of approximately 29,000 nesting pairs on 341 islands, and speculated that the population peaked in late 1980s or early 1990s. Despite their historic comeback, eiders in Maine were believed to be in decline beginning in the 1990s (Krohn et al, 1992). Eiders have low life time reproductive rates which make their population levels sensitive to factors that reduce adult survivorship. Therefore, recent natural mortality events (avian cholera in Quebec, die-offs due to virus and other causes in Massachusetts, and high rates of predation) and demand for sea duck hunting in the northeast has led to concerns about the sustainability of this increased harvest of eiders in New England, Quebec and the Canadian Maritimes. The overall goal of the restoration was to fully address the impacts to birds by returning injured natural resources to their pre-spill conditions as well as compensate for interim losses of the bird resources. This was attempted by replacing the quantity of bird-years (direct mortality plus foregone production) lost due to the spill through land purchase and management activities that protected existing breeding sites for loons, eiders and piping plovers. By protecting breeding pairs and their associated nesting sites, future productivity was enhanced sufficiently to compensate for the losses caused by the North Cape oil spill.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Under the provisions/authority of the Oil Pollution Act , Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) (represented by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) were designated as natural resource trustees and had the responsibility to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of natural resources injured as a result of the North Cape oil spill.
The trustees, on behalf of the public, determined the natural resource injuries, planned for appropriate restoration projects, prepared the draft and final restoration plans and implemented and oversaw restoration activities. Restoration plans were reviewed by experts from industry, restoration scientists, and interested members of the public. Decisions guiding restoration implementation and monitoring were developed as a part of a settlement agreement between resource managers and responsible parties. Final authority to make determinations regarding injury and restoration rested solely with the trustees.
The trustees have considered and evaluated a full suite of restoration alternatives for compensating bird injuries from the North Cape oil spill. Of all the bird injuries, losses were greatest for loons and eiders. Loon restoration was of particular importance because of scientific concern about the status of their populations in the northeastern United States and strong public interest in and support for this species. Natural mortality events and increased demand for hunting opportunities have impacted the New England eider population and the Rhode Island piping plover population has had difficulty maintaining its size, as evidenced by its listing as a threatened species and state protection efforts. Since these bird species have declined relative to their historic populations due to hunting pressure and habitat loss and degradation, it was reasonably certain that their restoration would result in enhanced ecological services in the area of spill impact. Thus a net ecological benefit to compensate for the oil spill injuries to natural resources was expected.

Description of Project Activities: Common Loon
The goal of the loon restoration was to restore the 2,920 loon-years lost as a result of the spill. Since restoration did not begin until 2000, the 2,920 lost loon-years were adjusted for the delay (2920 x (1.03)^4). This resulted in 3,286 loon-years required for restoration. The restoration focused on protecting breeding loon populations by purchasing land and/or development rights to protect existing breeding habitat from future decreases in productivity associated with development.  By purchasing enough land to protect an appropriate number of loon pairs and their associated nesting sites, future loon productivity was enhanced sufficiently to compensate for the losses caused by the North Cape spill.

Approximately 25 loon pairs and their associated nesting sites needed protection to restore the lost bird-years.  Since Rhode Island is only a wintering destination for loons, appropriate in-state restoration options were not available.  Consequently, the trustees looked for restoration options in other New England states where loon breeding habitat is present. Working with an array of partners (including New England Forestry Foundation, Downeast Lakes Land Trust, Forest Society of Maine, and The Nature Conservancy), the trustees assisted with the permanent protection of nearly 1.5 million acres of Maine forests and lakes that provide nesting habitat for nearly 150 loon pairs.

A loon protection/monitoring/education program was implemented to ensure that the restoration project was meeting established objectives.  Field biologists were hired to protect and monitor the loons during the breeding season and implement educational efforts for 10 years.  Specific tasks included: ensuring that there was no physical disturbance to the loon habitat, monitoring loon biological activity, protecting nest sites from human disturbance, organizing and implementing educational activities for residents and recreational users of protected lakes.  Results from the monitoring efforts indicated that loon productivity varies by region and season.  This variability has important implications for future loon restoration scaling efforts.  While the average productivity was much lower than expected for the North Cape restoration scaling effort (0.20 compared to 0.5), the opportunity to leverage settlement funds and protect many more nests than anticipated, resulted in a successful restoration effort. 

For more detailed information about the monitoring methods and results contact the USFWS New England Field Office.

Piping Plover
The goal of the piping plover restoration was to improve the productivity of local piping plover populations by enhancing their reproductive success, thereby replacing productivity lost due to the North Cape oil spill (five piping plover chicks).  This was attempted by reducing disturbance and predation at new and existing piping plover nesting sites.  

The trustees worked with biologists from the Rhode Island National Wildlife Refuge (RINWR) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to implement monitoring and management activities that effectively addressed recovery tasks identified in the Atlantic Coast Piping Plover Revised Recovery Plan (USFWS, 1995) and met established objectives of the restoration plan.  The activities included exclosing nests to protect against predation, installing symbolic fencing to limit pedestrian access to nesting areas, predator removal, posting interpretive signage and presenting educational programs to the public. With the help of volunteers, biologists educated beachgoers about dog leash laws and minimizing disturbance to nesting piping plovers. Numerous partnerships were also developed with local landowners to cooperatively manage beaches for piping plover protection.  

As a result of these efforts, piping plover nesting pairs have increased from 35 pairs on nine beaches in 2000 to 58 pairs on 11 beaches in 2006 (Edwards et al, 2006).  In addition to the increased numbers of nesting pairs, plover productivity appears to have stabilized to approximately one chick per pair based upon monitoring data collected from 1998-2008 (Hartlaub et al, 2009).  However, this productivity is below the 1.24 estimate needed to maintain a stable piping plover population. Use of exclosures was discontinued in some locations due to adult mortality associated with these structures and changes in climatic conditions appear to effect hatching success as well as chick mortality. For more detailed information regarding monitoring methods and results contact the Rhode Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex or the Rhode Island Chapter of The Nature Conservancy.

Common Eider
The goal of the common eider project was to restore the 2,933 marine bird-years (adjusted to the year 2000) lost as a result of the North Cape oil spill.  This was attempted by protecting nesting habitat.  Habitat protection offered a practical effective means of preventing future losses of eider productivity associated with development.  It was important to protect/acquire an entire island, as previous restoration projects that allowed development on portions of an island that was not directly utilized by an eider colony had generally been unsuccessful at restoring targeted populations (Attachment 1).  In addition, the existence of development pressure was an important project condition, as purchases of non-threatened sites would have little benefit for eider productivity rates.  By purchasing enough land to protect an appropriate number of nest sites, future productivity was expected to be enhanced sufficiently to compensate for the loss due to the North Cape spill.

To restore the lost marine bird-years, the Trustees estimated that approximately 315 nest sites should be protected.  Assuming typical eider densities, a minimum of 24 island acres were required to protect this number of nest sites (Sperduto et al, 1999).  In partnership with the Maine Coast Heritage Trust, the State of Maine, the Nature Conservancy and the Casco Bay Estuary Project, the trustees provided funds to permanently protect Flag Island, a 42-acre island in Casco Bay, Maine.  The island is considered one of the most important nesting islands for eiders in Casco Bay and was reported to have over 600 pairs of nesting eiders as recently as 1999 (Allen et al, 2009).

A marine bird protection/monitoring program was implemented to ensure that the restoration project was meeting established objectives.  Field biologists were hired to protect and monitor seaducks during the breeding season and perform the following tasks: ensure that there was no physical disturbance to the seaduck habitat, monitor seaduck biological activity, and protect nest sites from human disturbance.  The final report produced from these monitoring activities (Allen et al, 2009) indicated that the long term estimate of nesting pairs on the island is 500-600.  The observed nesting success was high with an average of 79% from 2005 through 2007.  The estimated survival for Flag Island female eiders was 87% between the years of 2003-2008. Monitoring also determined that Flag Island is not utilized as a brood-rearing area for eider ducklings; crÁ¨ches left the island for the mainland within hours after reaching the water.  Duckling predation rates adjacent to Flag Island and on brood rearing habitats were not as high as those observed at other locations in previous studies along the Maine coast.   Overall productivity, ducklings per breeding female, averaged 0.316 from 2006 to 2007.  Based on the number of nesting pairs protected and the overall productivity, the restoration effort successfully restored the estimated marine-bird years lost.  For more detailed information regarding monitoring methods and results contact the USFWS New England Field Office. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: An average of 500-600 common eider and approximately 150 common loon nesting sites have been protected through the purchase of land and development rights.  The number of piping plover nesting pairs has increased sufficiently such that the 5 lost chicks have been replaced. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Common Loon
The number of territorial loon pairs has increased during the restoration.  Productivity varied by both season and region with the overall productivity in the restoration area below the amount needed to maintain a self-sustaining population.  Egg predation, water level fluctuations, elevated methylmercury availability, and heavy rain have caused nest failure and low hatching rates leading to declines in overall productivity.  Efforts to address these impacts will need to be implemented to stabilize the loon population in this portion of its breeding area.

Piping Plover
The number of nesting pairs of piping plovers and the beaches being utilized for production has increased during the restoration.  However, plover productivity is below the amount needed to maintain a stable population.  Development, human disturbance and predation are factors that negatively affect productivity.  Efforts to educate the public about vehicular traffic, dog leash laws and the plight of the piping plover will need to continue in order to minimize these impacts.  In recent years, climatic conditions have had a negative effect on productivity.  Extremely high tides during the nesting season have increased egg mortality due to nest overwash and young chick mortality has increased as a result of high temperatures and heavy rainfall shortly after hatch.
 
Common Eider 
Predation by herring gulls and great black-backed gulls is the major cause of mortality for common eider eggs and ducklings (Mawhinney, 1997).   Great black-back gulls (GBBG) are capable of virtually eliminating the reproductive output of some eider colonies during some years.  It is likely that current GBBG numbers greatly exceed historic levels due to the presence of open dumps and landfills, abundance of fish processing waste, and subsidized feeding from commercial fishing vessels.  Managers are concerned that elevated numbers of GBBG will further reduce the naturally low recruitment rates for eiders and decrease their ability to sustain current population levels.  Predation of hen eiders by a burgeoning bald eagle population, river otters (a relatively new predator to off shore islands) and mink is also cause for concern (Attachment 1).

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Birds are appreciated and enjoyed by millions of people throughout the United States.   Sixty four million people pursue bird-related recreation, such as birdwatching, backyard bird feeding, hunting, and photography.  Pursuit of these activities contributes nearly $40 billion to local economies annually. The restoration of common eider, common loon and piping plover populations will ensure that these birds continue to provide recreational opportunities in Block Island Sound as well as throughout their range.
The importance and value of monitoring was demonstrated in this restoration. Monitoring data were analyzed and the strategies employed were adjusted to keep the restoration heading along the desired ecological trajectory. Use of exclosures was discontinued at some piping plover nesting locations due to adult mortality associated with these structures and field methods were adjusted to minimize human disturbance to nesting birds while collecting monitoring data. Data analysis also furthered the knowledge of habitat requirements and environmental conditions that may impact these bird species. Elevated levels of methylmercury negatively affected productivity of loons and fluctuations in water level have led to egg and chick mortality and delayed nesting. Monitoring has aided in developing effective methods for restoration and management of these species so that they continue to provide ecological services to Block Island Sound. Monitoring also provided a means for evaluating the effectiveness of the overall restoration and provided important data for common loons that will help refine future restoration scaling efforts in the northeast.
Restoration managers also found that partnering with other agencies and organizations facilitated land purchases that protected far more nesting sites than the funds from the restoration alone would have accomplished. Monitoring efforts were also done in partnership with organizations that already had programs in place. In this way, the funds from the restoration were used to continue long term monitoring and the restoration benefited from information gathered through previous year’s efforts. All three of the bird species (common eider, common loon and piping plover) that were the focus of this restoration are birds of management concern for the USFWS Migratory Bird Program and consequently are given priority emphasis. The mission of the Migratory Bird Program is to conserve migratory bird populations and their habitats for future generations, through careful monitoring, effective management, and by supporting national and international partnerships that conserve habitat for migratory birds. For details regarding these monitoring and management activities see the USFWS “A Blueprint for the Future of Migratory Birds” Migratory Bird Program Strategic Plan 2004-2014 at http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/AboutUS/mbstratplan/finalmbstratplan.pdf.
The transport of oil and other hazardous substances along the East coast carries with it the risk of future spills or releases into the Block Island Sound ecosystem. Despite the United States’ best efforts to prevent spills, almost 14,000 oil spills are reported each year. The National Oil and Hazardous Substance Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) provides the organizational structure and procedures to prepare for and respond to discharges of oil and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants. The United States Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and other organizations have specially trained emergency response personnel ready to deploy advanced response mechanisms available for controlling oil spills and minimizing their impacts on human health and the environment. Since most spill response equipment and materials are greatly affected by factors such as conditions at sea, water currents, and wind; the key to effectively combating spills is careful selection and proper use of the equipment and materials best suited to the type of oil and the conditions at the spill site. Rapid response to spills and proper use of containment and recovery equipment can reduce the damage to shorelines and other threatened areas. "

The results of over 30 studies of potential resource injuries caused by the spill were reviewed and a variety of experts in relevant scientific and technical disciplines were consulted. Based on this work, it is believed that the spill caused significant injuries to biota in the offshore and salt pond environments and to a variety of birds. Under the natural resource damage assessment provisions of the Oil Pollution Act, a trustee council, made up of representatives of Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), was established to review, select, and oversee implementation of restoration actions for natural resources injured by the spill. A comprehensive restoration plan was developed and projects were implemented for American lobster, piping plover, common loon, and sea ducks. Projects were also implemented to restore alewife runs in the salt pond watersheds as compensation for lost recreational fishing opportunities, and open space lands have been protected to compensate for losses to other marine and salt pond organisms. This particular case study focuses on the shellfish restoration project which was an effort to restore quahog, bay scallop and oyster populations in the coastal Rhode Island salt ponds following injuries caused by the North Cape oil spill.Approximately 1.0 million kilograms of bivalve biomass were lost (direct mortality plus production foregone). The majority of the injury was to surf clams, (Spisula solidissma), of which 19.4 million animals were killed, resulting in a loss of 970,400 kilograms biomass. The goal of the restoration was to fully address the impacts to shellfish by returning injured natural resources to their pre-spill (baseline) conditions as well as compensate for interim losses of the shellfish resources. This was attempted by replacing the quantity of biomass (direct mortality plus forgone production) lost due to the spill. This replacement biomass is measured as the wet tissue weight of animals added to the system (stocked) plus weight added by the growth of stocked shellfish. Aspects of the restoration included quahog rescue from the Providence River Federal Navigation Channel dredge area, stock enhancement and restoration of quahogs, bay scallops and oysters through nursery, spat collection, spawning sanctuaries, and reseeding projects.Results from the research studies and monitoring have aided in developing effective methods for restoration and management of shellfish species. Cost effective methods of rearing shellfish have been developed, factors affecting survival (seed size, stocking density, available habitat, disease, etc) have been identified, the importance and value of monitoring has been demonstrated, and community interest and awareness of Rhode Island’s premier shellfish industry has been fostered by recruiting citizens to be actively involved in the restoration. The knowledge gained through these restoration activities will aid in the future management of shellfish so that they continue to provide ecological services to the Rhode Island salt ponds and Narragansett Bay.Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological) On January 19, 1996, during a severe winter storm, the tank barge North Cape, carrying 94,000 barrels (3.9 million gallons) of two blends of No. 2 home heating oil, struck ground off Moonstone Beach in South Kingstown, Rhode Island and began to leak oil into the surrounding water. Winds reaching 50 knots formed large, breaking waves that dispersed the oil throughout the water column and into contact with bottom sediments resulting in high concentrations of toxic components (i.e. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) in the shallow waters near shore (French McCay 2003). A second winter storm five days later brought the oil, which had been dissipating, back into the sensitive intertidal zone, resulting in substantial mortality of marine organisms (Gibson et al. 1997). In total, an estimated 828,000 gallons of the fuel oil were released into the coastal and offshore environments before the North Cape was refloated and moved to Newport, Rhode Island on Friday, January 26, one week after grounding.
The trustees reviewed the results of over 30 studies of potential resource injuries cause by the spill and consulted with a variety of experts in relevant scientific and technical disciplines. Based on this work, the trustees believed that the spill caused significant injuries to biota in the offshore and salt pond environments and to a variety of birds. While the effect of the oil spill was extensive, this case study is focused on the bivalve mortality and subsequent shellfish population restoration.
The trustees used a combination of field data and modeling to quantify injury to offshore community natural resources. Field data was used to document the abundance of biota in impact and reference areas and concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and PAH in sediment, water, and biota. These data were combined with information about oil fate and toxicity, and species abundances, to estimate the magnitude of injury through the use of a fate and effects model (SIMAP).
SIMAP estimates the distribution of spilled oil (as mass and concentrations) on the water surface, on shorelines, in the water column, and in the sediments. The model is three-dimensional, using a latitude-longitude grid to map environmental data. Algorithms based on state-of-the-art published research account for spreading, evaporation, transport, dispersion, emulsification, entrainment, dissolution, volatilization, partitioning, sedimentation, and degradation of the oil. Acute mortality of water column and benthic resources is estimated as a function of temperature, concentration of dissolved aromatics, and the length of exposure. Acute mortality of other wildlife is estimated as a function of area swept by oil, dosage, and vulnerability. Chronic effects of long-term exposure to sediment concentration of oil or via ingestion are not considered by this model.
The model was modified to more closely simulate the conditions of the North Cape spill by adding a surf entrainment algorithm. The results and output of the fates portion of the model were validated by comparison with overflight maps made during the response to the spill and with the measured concentrations of TPH and PAH in samples taken during the week following the spill. A complete description of the modeling is available in French (1998a).
Pre-spill abundance of bivalves was estimated using data from non-impacted sites as well as abundance data from previous studies in the literature. Areal extent of the injury was estimated by modeling. Bivalve injury was quantified with the SIMAP computer model. Bivalve exposure modeling accounted for all bivalves injured in the spill, not just those that washed up on shore. The modeling was based upon exposure to dissolved aromatic compounds in water at the bottom. Effects considered were acute toxicity as a result of this exposure. Chronic effects of long-term exposure to sediment concentrations of oil or via ingestion were not assessed in this analysis (French 1998a). The analysis indicates that approximately 1.0 million kilograms of bivalve biomass were lost as a result of the spill (direct mortality plus production foregone). The majority of the injury was to surf clams, of which 19.4 million animals were killed, resulting in a loss of 970,400 kilograms biomass. Limited amounts of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), quahogs/hard clams (Mercenaria merenaria), soft shell clams (Mya arenaria), oysters (Crossostrea virginica) and bay scallops (Argopecten irradians) were also killed by the oil spill. The area of impact was both within and outside the salt ponds, although injury to surf clams and other bivalves was primarily in the offshore environment, in the Nebraska Shoal area from Point Judith to Charlestown beach (French 1998a and b).
The trustees estimated that the injured bivalve populations would return to baseline levels through natural recovery within three to five years after the spill. This period of time encompasses the expected lifespan of the bivalves killed by the spill. Thus, based on information currently available there was no indication that bivalve larval abundance (and therefore future generations of bivalves) would be affected significantly in future years. A band of nine coastal ponds and contiguous marshes lies along the southern coast of Rhode Island. The salt ponds located within the North Cape spill area are described in File #4 (attached). The North Cape barge grounded immediately south of Trustom and Cards Ponds. Point Judith and Potters Ponds lie to the east and Ninigret and Green Hill Ponds to the west, with Quonochontaug and Winnapaug Ponds situated farther west. Of the nine salt ponds, five have permanent armored breachways constructed in the 1900s. Permanent breachways were constructed in Point Judith Pond in 1910 and in Ninigret Pond in 1952. Winnapaug and Quonochontaug Pond breachways were constructed in the late 1950s. A permanent tidal connection was established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for Green Hill Pond in 1962, by connecting a channel with Ninigret Pond. These ponds are affected by the ocean and influenced by tides, currents, and sedimentation processes. Only Cards and Trustom Ponds are closed to the ocean most of the year resulting in lower water salinity.
The physical environment of southern Rhode Island has been affected by land development in the watersheds of the coastal salt ponds in the towns of Charlestown, South Kingstown, Narragansett, and Westerly. These communities generate pollution to the ponds through release of road runoff, fertilizers, fish processing waste, and individual sewage disposal systems contamination of surface and ground waters. These contaminants have caused bacterial contamination and elevated nitrogen levels in some of the coastal salt pond waters. High nitrogen levels have led to increased eutrophication, decreased eelgrass beds, increased sediment hypoxia, and other detrimental effects to fish and wildlife habitats (Olsen and Lee 1985; Short et al. 1996). Storm-water runoff containing gasoline and fuel oils has also been identified as a potential threat to the salt pond ecosystems (Olsen and Lee 1985). The port of Galilee, situated at the entry to Point Judith Pond, supports a fleet of commercial fishing vessels. Fishing pressure has reduced once-abundant harvests of fish and shellfish in the salt ponds, as has habitat alteration caused by such activities as release of excess nutrients, dredge and fill operations, sediment transport, and damming of brooks and rivers.
Quahog
There is strong evidence that numbers of quahogs in Narragansett Bay and the coastal salt ponds have been substantially reduced from historic levels due primarily to overfishing (Baczenski et al. 1979; Boyd 1991; Crawford 1984; Ganz et al. 1992; Rice et al. 2000). RIDEM, as part of its shellfish management program, has designated quahog transplant and sanctuary areas in Narragansett Bay and the coastal salt ponds, and has a track record of transplanting quahogs from restricted waters into these areas for purposes of increasing population size and benefiting local fisheries. The Rhode Island Shellfishermen’s Association is also interested and engaged in quahog stock enhancement programs by working with the University of Rhode Island and Roger Williams University. These collaborative programs are aimed at reseeding quahogs in test sites to assess predation, survival, and growth rate factors to help evaluate the potential for conducting large-scale reseeding efforts in Narragansett Bay. Further, with the success of commercial shellfish hatcheries and advancing, cost-effective nursery techniques, quahog reseeding programs have flourished throughout the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States (Flimlin 2000). Many states and municipalities have successful quahog management programs that include transplanting as well as reseeding to enhance their quahog stocks.
Bay Scallop
Historically, Rhode Island salt ponds produced substantial amounts of bay scallops usually in a “boom-or-bust” fashion. Of the salt ponds targeted for shellfish restoration actions, Point Judith, Ninigret, and Quonochontaug have had a long history of producing bountiful crops of bay scallops. During the 1950s, bay scallop landings steadily averaged 81,160 pounds for the decade but declined drastically in the 1960s. However, the 1970s fetched 634,800 pounds, and 1978 was the “last great” bay scallop season when 448,700 pounds were harvested (National Marine Fisheries Service data). During the 1980s and 1990s, bay scalloping failed to produce any significant landings. Since that time, bay scallop recruitment failures have been widespread. The reasons for these failures are unknown, but evidence suggests multiple factors such as nuisance algal blooms, poor water quality, industrial waste, fishing pressure, anomalous environmental conditions, habitat loss, and predation are causes. A factor causing fluctuations in bay scallop populations is the short life span of the species, typically living only 20 to 24 months in New England waters. The short life span coupled with the other factors previously mentioned is presumably responsible for the decline in scallop harvests.
Oyster
Goode (1884) reported that oysters were once prevalent in Rhode Island’s coastal salt ponds, but populations have declined in recent years (Ganz 1997). The Narragansett Bay oyster fishery thrived between the 1800s and 1930s. In Rhode Island, the Oyster Act of 1864 set forth a requirement for oyster companies to comply with a mandatory cultch program stating that all disposal of oyster shell material must go to leased oyster grounds. At the height of Rhode Island’s oyster industry in 1910, 8,100 hectares of Narragansett Bay was farmed, producing 7,000 metric tons of oysters with the shell cultch recycled back into the bay (Rice et al. 2000). In addition to providing jobs, the Rhode Island Shellfish Commission (1880-1920) reported that the state received revenues from the oyster ground leases valued at over $700,000. By the 1920s, the oyster industry slowly declined for a number of reasons including industrial pollution, increased eutrophication from sewage disposal, increased sedimentation from land development, and the Great Hurricane of 1938 (Rice et al. 2000). In the late 1990s, Narragansett Bay oyster population rebounded in some locations, but recent decreases are probably due to fishing pressure, lack of successful sets and the effects of the shellfish parasite, Dermo (Perkinsus marinus) (Valliere, pers. comm. 1999; Gomez-Chiarri 2002). The economic importance and historical value of the state’s oyster industry is well recognized with the recent passage of the Narragansett Bay Oyster Restoration Act, RIGL 20-2- 45, enacted in 2001. This act declares the importance and need for the state to continue, “restoring and maintaining both the oyster population and oyster habitat.” The overall goal of the shellfish restoration is to replace the lost shellfish biomass through a variety of multi-species enhancement and restoration techniques. The restoration fully addressed the impacts to shellfish from the North Cape oil spill by attempting to return natural resources to their pre-spill (baseline) conditions, as well as compensate for interim losses of the shellfish resources. The trustees determined that restoration actions would be required to return the ecosystem to baseline conditions as the resources were not expected to recover in a reasonable amount of time without human intervention.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Under the authority of the Oil Pollution Act (OPA), Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) represented by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) were designated as natural resource trustees and had the responsibility to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of natural resources injured as a result of the North Cape oil spill.
The trustees, on behalf of the public, assessed the natural resource injuries, planned for appropriate restoration projects, prepared the draft and final restoration plans, and implemented and oversaw restoration activities. Restoration plans were reviewed by experts from industry, restoration scientists, and interested members of the public. Decisions guiding restoration implementation and monitoring were developed as a part of a settlement agreement between the natural resource trustees and responsible parties. Final authority to make determinations regarding injury and restoration rested solely with the trustees.
The trustees have considered and evaluated a full suite of restoration alternatives for compensating shellfish injuries from the North Cape oil spill. Quahog, bay scallop, and oyster provide ecological services (e.g., water filtration, benthicpelagic coupling from feeding activity, food for fish and invertebrates that prey upon molluscan larvae and seed, benthic biomass, and habitat value) similar to those functions lost due to the North Cape shellfish injuries. Since these shellfish species have declined relative to their historic populations due to heavy fishing pressure and habitat loss and degradation, it is reasonably certain that their restoration would result in enhanced ecological services in the area of spill impact. Thus a net ecological benefit to compensate for the oil spill injuries to natural resources is expected. Finally, shellfish restoration in the salt ponds and adjacent waters of Narragansett Bay is a feasible and proven technique, since restoration of shellfish has a long history in Northeast estuaries, with well-developed grow-out methods and reasonably well documented results.

Description of Project Activities: RESEARCH AND PLANNING
The existing shellfish resources of the coastal ponds were of particular importance to this shellfish restoration. In summer 2001, Ninigret, Quonochontaug, and Winnapaug Ponds were surveyed by RIDEM with assistance from the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography (URI-GSO) to collect baseline information on the shellfish populations. This survey was the initial phase of the North Cape Shellfish Restoration project and was funded by both settlement monies and a private grant to URI-GSO. To complete the study, RIDEM first established a 100-square meter (m2) grid overlay for each pond. For each grid selected for surveying, three 1 m2 substrate plots were sampled to a depth of one foot to determine sediment characteristics and shellfish species and their abundance and size.

This survey involved sampling 176 stations covering 1,711 acres in Ninigret Pond, 125 stations covering 632 acres in Quonochontaug Pond, and 118 stations covering 446 acres in Winnapaug Pond (Ganz, pers. comm.). Preliminary results indicated that these salt ponds were dominated by quahogs. Soft-shell clams were locally very abundant and very few oysters or bay scallops were observed in the ponds. The survey established quahog densities of 0.058/m2 in Winnapaug, 2.26/m2 in Ninigret, and 2.43/m2 in Quonochontaug, averaging 25.4 millimeters (mm) in width, and soft-shell clam densities of 0.023/m2 in Winnapaug, 1.04/m2 in Ninigret, and 1.25/m2 in Quonochontaug. Survey results are similar to previous shellfish surveys conducted by RIDEM (Ganz, pers. comm.). The trustees thoroughly evaluated the survey results as part of selecting shellfish restoration sites in these coastal salt ponds. Additional baseline surveys were conducted for Point Judith Pond and other coastal salt ponds during the summer of 2002. 

METHODS 
The North Cape Shellfish Restoration Project was accomplished through a variety of shellfish enhancement techniques; including shellfish grow-out and nurseries, direct seeding, and caged spawner sanctuaries.  Each restoration component included comprehensive monitoring that was conducted annually while restoration activities were being implemented.  The results of this monitoring have led to many adaptive management activities, and as a result, the methods outlined in the original restoration plan (File #1 attached) have changed to ensure the restoration is moving along an ecological trajectory that would most likely reach the goals stated in the restoration plan.

Quahog Enhancement
The quahog enhancement project was established in 2002 and was based on the release of hatchery-produced seed, grown out to a suitable size to enhance the breeding population, and ultimately, recruitment of subsequent generations.  The grow-out of quahog seed typically requires a two-year period in southern New England (Appleyard and DeAtleris 2001).  This necessitates ""over-wintering"" the juvenile quahogs for at least one winter prior to seeding.  At the end of 2005 both the 2004 and 2005 cohorts were over-wintered, as the 2004 cohort were the subjects of a grow-out experiment in Quonochontaug Pond.  During the over-wintering of 2005-06, remaining quahogs from the North Cape upweller were housed in troughs in the shallow sub-tidal waters of Point Judith Pond adjacent to the RIDEM Coastal Fisheries Laboratory.  Quahogs in the bottom grow-out treatments established in 2005 were left in those treatments after sampling in November 2005.  In 2006 the over-wintered seed from 2005 was retrieved, sampled, and the grow-out continued in the North Cape upweller at Camp Fuller.  The quahog bottom grow-out treatments were sampled at retrieval to determine annual performance, and added to the North Cape upweller for further grow-out prior to seeding.

All over-wintered quahogs were maintained in the upweller to the beginning of August 2006, when a portion of the seed was used to establish growth and mortality experimental plots in both Quonochontaug and Ninigret ponds.  The experimental plots were repeats of the design used in Quonochontaug Pond in 2004-05, and were designed to provide spatial information on mortality and growth within the seeding areas and between ponds, as well as temporal variation between years.  All remaining quahog were seeded into the protected spawner sanctuary in Ninigret Pond.  The final monitoring of experimental plots was completed in August 2007, and was the culmination of the North Cape quahog enhancement program.  See the individual North Cape Shellfish annual reports for the complete methodologies for each year of the quahog enhancement work: http://www.darrp.noaa.gov/northeast/north_cape/shellfishRestoration.html.

Bay Scallop Restoration
In 2002 and 2003, the North Cape Shellfish Restoration Program seeded approximately 1.5 million scallops directly into four coastal ponds (Ninigret, Potter, Quonochontaug, and Green Hill Ponds), in an attempt to re-establish an effective breeding population for the 2004 season (Hancock et al. 2005). In spring 2004, the ponds were surveyed to estimate the total abundance of the surviving scallops. The number of scallops in all ponds was low (Hancock et al. 2005). Ninigret Pond had the highest number of surviving scallops, estimated to be 9,300 and these were primarily in the western area of the pond. Diver observations of post release scallops suggested high mortality due to crab predation (Holly et al. 2005). As a result of the low survival of the seeded scallops, the focus of the scallop project was shifted to establishing ""˜caged spawner sanctuaries' where broodstock could be protected from predation within mesh cages to minimize mortality and maximize their reproductive output.  The caged spawner sanctuary technique was applied in Ningret Pond in 2004 and 2005, Quonochontaug Pond in 2006 and 2007, and Point Judith Pond in 2008.

In general, bay scallop spawning sanctuaries consisted of multiple floating wire mesh cages containing 10,000 to 20,000 adult scallops within mesh pouches.  The scallop cages were deployed in early June and retrieved in November.  Spatial and temporal spat settlement was monitored by the use of spat collectors deployed throughout the pond, and retrieved every 30 days from July to November. Diver surveys were conducted early the following summer season to obtain estimates of free living scallop populations.  Monitoring was continued in each pond, even after the spawner cages were moved to a different location, to monitor the continued population changes and fluctuations.

The bay scallop nursery, spat collection, spawning sanctuary, and reseeding projects allowed opportunity for community volunteer and educational institution involvement. There were also opportunities to assist in monitoring growth, survival, and recruitment. This community-based restoration effort promoted a stewardship interest in the bay scallop resource and fostered greater regard for following and enforcing fishery regulations and improving salt pond water quality.  See the individual North Cape Shellfish annual reports for the complete methodologies for each year of the scallop restoration work:  http://www.darrp.noaa.gov/northeast/north_cape/shellfishRestoration.html

Oyster Restoration
Remote Setting and Oyster Nursery
This project restored oyster populations in Rhode Island waters by using the remote setting technique.  Rhode Island oysters were collected and held in tanks as adult broodstock for the production of oyster larvae. The larvae were introduced to large setting tanks filled with shell known as cultch. Weathered cultch material was purchased from local suppliers.  The shell material was screened to retain large shell fragments.  Shells were placed into tubular extrusion netting and sealed at both ends. Within 24 hours, eyed larvae settled onto the cultch, and the shell bags were transported to designated nursery sites at Jenny's Creek on Prudence Island, Point Judith Pond near the RIDEM Coastal Fisheries Laboratory, and Trustom Pond, situated on the Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge.  Each nursery site required a small area, approximately 1,000 square feet.  Shell bags were placed on racks and/or wooden pallets within the intertidal zone region. The oyster spat grew to planting size (~20 mm) in these nurseries within three months.  Once the oysters reached this size, the spatted cultch material was transported to designated areas, 3/4 to 1 acre in area, with the material spread in a thin layer (~1-inch thick) on top of the bed cultch material.   In 2008, a different approach to raising broodstock was taken to maximize growth and reduce labor costs of remote setting.  Post settled oysters individually set on micro cultch were purchased from a commercial hatchery and raised in a floating upweller system (FLUPSY).   This approach proved to be an effective and efficient way to maximize growth in a given season.  The oysters in the FLUPSY are provided greater access to food due to high water flow-through, maintained with flow pumps.  Better nutrition results in larger oysters than those found in the nursery trays at the Coastal Fisheries Laboratory with natural flow.  The increased growth will optimally translate into increased survival, as the oysters enter their first winter with a higher energy reserve (Beal et al. 1995; Taborsky 2003). Planted sites were monitored to determine long-term survival, growth, and recruitment in evaluating the performance of the project. These sites were also monitored for the effects of predation and presence of any disease. Bed cultch will continue to be monitored to assess long-term stability, effects of sedimentation, and ecological characteristics.     

Habitat Enhancement
Natural oysters commonly grow on large clusters attaching to hard substrates and other shells, forming large oyster beds and reef structures providing a suitable substrate for oyster larvae settlement (Bahr and Lanier 1981).  This program stabilized designated oyster planting sites by utilizing shell material to harden the bottom substrate prior to planting. Free-planting locations were designated under the guidance of RIDEM. These locations were in close proximity to the oyster nurseries in the coastal salt ponds and Narragansett Bay. Shell fragments remaining from shell bag production were used for the bed cultch. Bed cultch material provided a firm foundation for the spatted cultch to minimize sedimentation and suffocation. Approximately 20 to 30 cubic yards were dispersed to a depth of no more than several inches over designated planting grounds approximately 1 acre in size. Bed cultch was loaded from the staging areas onto trucks, boats, or barges for dispersal. Components of this project involved community groups, volunteers, local universities and colleges, agencies, and non-governmental organizations. As part of this habitat enhancement component, monitoring evaluated the rates of spat settlement and growth, as well as sedimentation and other adverse effects.

RESULTS
Annual reports that present in depth information regarding monitoring methods and results additional research (University of Rhode Island Coastal Fellows research projects), as well as the types of adaptive management that has occurred for each species-specific restoration have been produced since 2003.  The reports are available electronically at http://www.darrp.noaa.gov/northeast/north_cape/shellfishRestoration.html.  Details of the annual reports are beyond the scope of what can be presented in this case study format.  Therefore the following is an overview of the information found in the reports for each species.

Quahog Enhancement
The quahog enhancement project conducted in Ninigret and Quonochontaug ponds was based on the release of hatchery-produced seed, grown out to a suitable size to enhance the breeding population, and ultimately, recruitment of subsequent generations (Hancock et al. 2005; Hancock et al. 2006; Hancock et al. 2007).  The project was completed in 2007, and included the evaluation of various rearing and grow out methods, habitat assessments to determine the most suitable sites for shellfish release, baseline monitoring for assessment of growth and survival, and discrete experiments to assess the growth and mortality of quahogs released at different densities and size classes.

Bottom grow out and overwintering in a protected nursery environment was determined to be the most cost effective and successful rearing method.  Quahog seed produced utilizing this method had two seasons of growth and reached sufficient size to avoid the very high mortality associated with the release of seed less than about 20 mm length.  Quahog seed reared in floating upwellers had higher survival and slightly better growth, but demanded a higher investment of staff time.  

The annual survival data collected support the conclusion that survival is significantly increased at lower seeding densities (Hancock et al. 2007).  Current thought is that predator search efforts are less concentrated in low prey density areas compared to areas where prey have been introduced at higher densities (Peterson et al. 1995; Hancock et al. 2007). The annual survey results also support the conclusion that survival significantly increases with increasing seed size.  However, this may not persist beyond a size of about 22.5 mm, indicating a ""size refuge"" exists (Peterson et al. 1995; Hancock et al. 2007).  Variation in quahog survival was also dependent on the location of test plots which were positioned no further than 100 meters from one another (Hancock et al. 2006).  These significant differences in survival of quahog within a few hundred meters may be due to fine scale habitat variations such as changes in sediment type and density, hydrology, or predator concentrations.

Bay Scallop Restoration
The bay scallop restoration project was based on the release of hatchery produced seed to re-establish effective breeding populations in coastal Rhode Island ponds (Hancock et al. 2005; Hancock et al. 2006; Hancock et al. 2007).  The project is on-going and includes monitoring scallop abundance and recruitment of juvenile bay scallops, baseline population estimates to determine efficacy of spawner sanctuaries, as well as discrete experiments to test the tolerance of juvenile scallops to low oxygen levels and examine habitat utilization.

The sanctuaries have proven to be a cost effective method for enhancing recruitment to the coastal ponds.  Spawner sanctuaries have been deployed in Ninigret (2004 and 2005), Quonochontaug (2006 and 2007) and most recently Point Judith (2008) ponds.  The sanctuaries are typically placed in a pond for two years to provide spat fall and eventual broodstock.   Broodstock surveys and scallop recruitment monitoring have revealed the success of this method in providing increased numbers of scallops in both Ninigret and Quonochontaug ponds.  Scallop abundance is consistently greater in the sandy/rubble habitats of these ponds.  Data indicates that location of spat settlement and subsequent recruitment into favorable habitat is an important factor to a successful population.

Eutrophication of the coastal salt ponds has caused dissolved oxygen levels to vary widely within a 24-hour period.  In order to determine if these variations were having an impact on bay scallop survival a laboratory experiment to test the tolerance of juvenile scallops to low oxygen was conducted.  The results indicated that the scallops are tolerant of the diurnal oxygen levels observed and that low dissolved oxygen is not significantly impacting survival.  The decline of sea grass beds and other vegetation in the salt ponds was also of concern.  To determine if this loss of vegetation was limiting bay scallops, habitat utilization was examined.  The data indicated that three-dimensional vegetation (e.g. sea grass) is not essential for successful scallop recruitment and therefore not limiting the success of the restoration.

Oyster Restoration
The oyster restoration project included the husbandry of hatchery produced juvenile oysters in floating upwellers for grow out and release to selected sites in an effort to enhance the breeding population and recruitment of subsequent generations (Hancock et al. 2005; Hancock et al. 2006; Hancock et al. 2007).  The project is on-going and includes, baseline monitoring for assessment of growth and survival and discrete experiments to assess spat recruitment, gonadal development, spawning and settlement as well as the impact of the Dermo parasite and seed size on the survival of seeded oysters.

To date, over 5.4 million North Cape oysters have been seeded into seven restoration sites in Rhode Island salt ponds and Narragansett Bay.  Survivorship and growth of oyster cohorts released in previous years were monitored and results indicate that survivorship varies from site to site and year to year.  The total numbers of oysters at each restoration site sampled in 2008 have decreased, despite successful seeding efforts in 2003 to 2006.  Monitoring the pathogen loads of Dermo in the seeded restoration sites has shown a 100% prevalence of disease at Smelt Brook Cove and Saugatucket River, moderate pathogen loads at The Cove and Potter Cove and low levels at Bissel Channel.  Disease testing in 2008 has shown an increase in prevalence and pathogen loads in all restoration sites.  The level of Dermo infection increases with age, as does the associated percent mortality (Encomio et al. 2005).  It is possible that the older animals seeded into the restoration sites are beginning to succumb to an accumulation of Dermo.  Traditionally survival rates at the sites have been high, therefore future monitoring of both newly seeded and older cohorts needs to continue to better understand the demographics of each site.  The experiment regarding seed size and survival is still in the data collection phase.  The oysters in the restoration sites are reproducing and exhibiting normal gonadal development, however there is a lack of spat recruitment.  The cause of the observed limited recruitment may exist somewhere between planktonic stage larvae and settlement.  Larvae observed in the water column but not observed as settled spat may be a result of a number of different factors including predation, disease, increased siltation, inadequate available substrate, or larval transport greater than the study area (Dickie 1995; Hancock 1973; Wolf 1988). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Bay Scallop
Increased numbers of bay scallops have been observed in both Ninigret and Quonochontaug ponds after deploying spawner sanctuaries in those locations.  Survey results from 2008 suggest that the bay scallop restoration efforts in Ninigret pond has been successful in restoring a bay scallop population which was sufficiently resilient to rebound from a population decline caused by extreme environmental conditions.

Oyster  
Seven oyster restoration sites have been seeded with 5.4 million juvenile oysters.  Traditionally survival rates at the sites have been high, however data collected in 2008 showed a decline in oyster abundance at each site sampled.  Continued monitoring will increase the understanding of the effects seed size, pathogens, and disease load have on oyster survival as well as factors influencing recruitment. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Many ecological impacts play a role in limiting the success of any shellfish restoration project.  Disease, predation, increased siltation, and lack of suitable settlement substrate often limit the success of recovering populations.

The oyster population is exhibiting limited recruitment.  Results from the studies conducted suggest the cause of this limited recruitment may exist somewhere between planktonic stage larvae and settlement. A number of different factors including Juvenile Oyster Disease may explain the observed larval abundance in the water column without observed settlement.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: This restoration project established a community-based program by recruiting citizens to be actively involved in the enhancement projects which helped to foster interest and awareness of Rhode Island's premier shellfish industry.
The importance and value of monitoring was demonstrated in this restoration. Monitoring data was analyzed and the strategies employed were adjusted to keep the restoration heading along the desired ecological trajectory. Broadcast seeding was determined to be an ineffective method of restoration, and nursery, grow-out, spat collection and spawning sanctuary techniques were developed and improved for the three shellfish species being restored or enhanced. Experiments conducted have furthered the knowledge of habitat requirements and environmental conditions that may impact shellfish. Results from the experiments and monitoring have aided in developing effective methods for restoration and management of these species so that they continue to provide ecological services to the Rhode Island salt ponds and Narragansett Bay. Despite the United States’ best efforts to prevent spills, almost 14,000 oil spills are reported each year. The National Oil and Hazardous Substance Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) provides the organizational structure and procedures for preparing for and responding to discharges of oil and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants. The United States Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and other organizations have specially trained emergency response personnel ready to deploy advanced response mechanisms available for controlling oil spills and minimizing their impacts on human health and the environment. Since most spill response equipment and materials are greatly affected by factors such as conditions at sea, water currents, and wind; the key to effectively combating spills is careful selection and proper use of the equipment and materials best suited to the type of oil and the conditions at the spill site. Rapid response to spills and proper use of containment and recovery equipment can reduce the damage to shorelines and other threatened areas.
Activities conducted in this restoration compliment and have been incorporated into the RIDEM shellfish management program. RIDEM will continue to manage and monitor shellfish populations long after this restoration program has been completed. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-maryland-anacostia-riparian-meadow-restoration/	USA: Maryland: Anacostia Riparian Meadow Restoration	United States of America	2007-01-04	2007-01-04	"In 2007 the Anacostia Watershed Society (AWS) initiated an experimental research project with the help of an interdisciplinary team of experts to look for alternative methods to riparian buffer restoration where reforestation is not permitted because of stream channel engineering constraints. AWS has been working at a short section of the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River, immediately downstream of the 38th Avenue Bridge in Hyattsville, Maryland, in the Washington Metropolitan Area. In the 1950’s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed levees that reach from the bridge down to the confluence of the Anacostia River with the Potomac River. The levees were designed to protect surrounding communities such as Hyattsville from a 100-year storm. As a consequence of levee construction, much of the natural river conditions were severely disturbed and the banks were reinforced with large, angular blocks of gray granite (known as “riprap”).AWS conducted an experimental habitat restoration project, called the 38th St. Bridge Project, on the rip-rap slope along the streambanks in order to demonstrate an alternative to the county’s annual mowing-and-spraying of herbicide. Mowing-and-spraying kills all the native plant species and leaves suitable habitat for non-native invasive plant species, which rapidly encroach upon these streambanks. The purpose of the project was to monitor the impact of three vegetation management regimens on plant species and how the proposed method of native herbaceous plant species would be an alternative to the mowing-and-spraying without increasing the channel roughness and thus the likelihood of a flood that could endangered the communities downriver.Our results and observations show that the plot cultivated with native herbaceous plant species and subjected to invasive plant control (planted plot) support more native plant species diversity (78 plant species; 43 native species and 35 non-native species) and wildlife than those that are subject to the mowing-and-spraying method (39 plant species; 12 native species and 27 non-native species). Planting native forbs and controlling the most invasive alien species could be a promising vegetation management that can be used by the public agencies to achieve a better management of urban green spaces. This could be done without meaningfully changing the hydraulic smoothness of the channel, and would return aesthetics for the benefit of the park users and improve the urban wildlife habitat.Deforestation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The project is located in the middle of a suburban area on the outskirts of Washington, DC; the area has been subject to urban development to some extent since colonial times. It is a highly fragmented landscape with some remnant woodland habitat and other greenspaces along house yards, riparian buffers and adjacent small patches of protected parkland. In the 1950’s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed levees that reach from the 38th Avenue bridge down to the confluence of the Anacostia River with the Potomac River. Before the construction of the levees the area was deforested. The Anacostia River watershed comprises an area of 456 square kilometers. It includes most of the eastern half of the District of Columbia and large portions of Prince George’s County and Montgomery County in Maryland. There are three major drainage areas comprising the Anacostia watershed: the Northwest Branch, the Northeast Branch, and the tidal drainage (AWRP 2009).
The Northwest and Northeast branches are, with the exception of their lowermost reaches, free-flowing (non-tidal) streams; this section includes the project site. The confluence of these two major streams forms the tidal Anacostia River in the vicinity of Bladensburg, Maryland. The tidal drainage area consists of the tidal river and its floodplain, as well as small Coastal Plain streams that flow directly into the tidal river; most of these streams are enclosed in storm sewer systems. The tidal reach of the Anacostia River is 8.4 miles (13.5 kilometers) in length from the confluence of the Northwest and Northeast Branches downstream to the Potomac River. The river joins the Potomac approximately 108 miles (174 kilometers) upstream of the Chesapeake Bay (AWRP 2009). The objectives of the research project were set by the Anacostia Watershed Society with the aid of experts in the fields of edaphology, hydrology, botany, ornithology, and entomology. Channel infrastructure maintenance practices required by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Public Works were important criteria for establishing the project goals. The idea of the project was to introduce a better model of vegetation management that would benefit native biota without jeopardizing the purpose of the infrastructure built along the river. Thus, the project’s primary goals included:
1. To introduce soft-stemmed, native, herbaceous vegetation to the site and see if it had the effect of reducing channel roughness (the vegetation should lie flat during a flood, softening the impact of the angular riprap on flowing water) thus improving channel conductivity,
2. To monitor the impact of three vegetation management regimens on plant community composition,
3. To determine if the different management regimens would impact the soils at the site (for example accretion or erosion), and
4. To determine if changes in plant community composition resulted in an increased use by native pollinators and native birds.
Having concluded the research phase of the project, AWS seeks to implement a habitat restoration project that puts into practice all the lessons learned from the research phase. The new implementation phase will focus initially on a 1.14-mile segment of the NW Branch of the Anacostia River from the 38th Avenue Bridge to the Rhode Island Avenue Bridge. Eventually, the effort will expand downriver and up the NE Branch of the Anacostia River. The new objectives set for the implementation phase are the following:
1. Remove 100% of the woody plants growing on the streambanks in all the areas that are currently subjected to the mowing-and-spraying vegetation management regime. This applies for all the plants containing woody tissues regardless if there are either native or non-native; this includes shrubs, vines, woody herbaceous plants (not true woody plants), and trees. This is a channel maintenance requirement set by the Army Corps of Engineers.
2. Stop the extensive use of herbicide to control the vegetation along the streambanks; and gradually reduce it through the use of a targeted herbicide application regime until an herbaceous plant community with a dominant cover of native species establishes successfully at the restored sites.
3. Replace the mowing-and-spraying vegetation management regime used along the streambanks with an open-land habitat restoration management approach that encourages the establishment of a diverse herbaceous native plant vegetation cover that supports more wildlife.
4. Reduce the populations of non-native highly invasive plant species at the restored sites to increase the area of habitat available for native plant species.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The infrastructure built by the Army Corps off Engineers had the purpose of protecting local communities from a 100-year storm. Ever since, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Public Works have been providing maintenance to the streambank, mostly avoiding the establishment of woody vegetation that would increase the channel roughness. The Anacostia Watershed Society has been working for the last 20 years to clean and restore the river watershed. It was this organization that identified the need to use an alternative vegetation management method that would increase native species diversity without jeopardizing the main purpose of the infrastructure built by the government agencies (which have recently agreed to implement the method proposed by AWS). AWS uses volunteer work to achieve its environmental mandate of recovering the shores.

Description of Project Activities: During the research and planning phase of the project, in which the project is currently situated, the proposed vegetation management regime has been analyzed and documented and the management practices determined. The overall goal was to satisfy the Army Corps of Engineers' objectives of high channel conductivity through introducing soft-stemmed native plants to the riprap bank and shoulder meadow areas. In turn, these native plants would support native pollinator and bird communities. A drought during the growing season of 2007 partially affected the research results since it impacted both the planted natives and the naturally occurring plant species. Flowering was greatly reduced for most plants, and this in turn reduced the attraction of all the plots to pollinators, and reduced seed set to attract birds (Tangren 2007). A list of all species observed within each plot was compiled during the period from 2007 to 2009. Most species were keyed using The Herbaceous Plants of Maryland (Brown and Brown, 1984). This taxonomic information was updated with a visit to the PLANTS database (http://plants.usda.gov). Additionally, a digital herbarium containing the common species was assembled and has been distributed to team members and printed in the study report. 

Three plots were marked for application of the following vegetation management approaches according to Tangren (2007):

1.  Blond Death Plot: First of all, what in the world is ""blonde death""? Dr. Sara Tangren used the term ""blonde death"" as a reference to the vegetation management method of mowing and spraying with herbicide. The unofficial term comes after the fact that the vegetation sprayed with herbicide turns into a light brown-yellow color which indicates the lethal fate of the plants. In this plot, the impact of the existing management regimen of semi-annual glyphosphate broadcasts and annual mowing of the shoulder meadows was sampled. For 2007 the shoulder meadow within the plot was not mowed so that plants would be able to grow, flower, and set seed to facilitate species identification. In most years, the riprap bank was sprayed twice (spring and late summer); in 2007, there was only one spraying date, June 26. This decision to omit the late season spraying may have been due to the drought; most vegetation does not respond to herbicide during a drought.  

2.  Control Plot  -  This plot was simply cordoned off and nothing was done to manage it.  The only exception was that any saplings observed were killed, as tree growth is not permitted on the riprap banks for flood control reasons.

3.  Planted Plot  -  This plot was similar to the Control Plot in that the regular spraying and mowing program was put off. However, here we selected certain invasive species to manage. Specific aspects of the invasive plant management regimen are to be provided in a separate report. Furthermore, in March 2007, 9,080 individual plants of 27 locally native species were planted on the riprap bank and in the shoulder meadow. Species with soft stems likely to lie down in a flood and reduce hydraulic roughness, and with habitat value likely to support birds or pollinators, were chosen. All plants were of local origin, many propagated from seed collected further upstream in the watershed of the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River.

The vegetation in the plots was measured quantitatively at the end of the growing season using the point-intercept method. Patch data was analyzed separately.

The results and observations show that the plot cultivated with native herbaceous species along the rip-rap slopes of the river (planted plot) support more native plant species diversity (78 plant species; 43 native species and 35 non-native species) and wildlife than those that are subject to the mowing-and-spraying method (39 plant species; 27 alien species and 12 native species). Observations from the project specialists have totaled 31 natives and 20 non-native species at the same plot throughout the growing season of 2009. The study and further observations also show that the blond death and control plot sites are havens for invasive plant species. On the blond death plot, 25 species were non-native and only 12 were native. This shows that the streambanks currently subjected to mowing-and-spraying with herbicides are areas of little diversity, lots of bare ground, and a prevalence of aliens (Tangren 2007).

The project seeks to replace the mowing-and-spraying vegetation management regime used along the streambanks with an open-land habitat restoration management approach that encourages the establishment of a diverse herbaceous native plant community that supports more wildlife. The management practices to be used in the implementation stage are as follows:

 -   Site preparation and seed sowing: This will be done by means of mechanical and chemical methods to control the existing vegetation (mostly non-native species) and prepare the soils for subsequent seed sowing. Seeds of native herbaceous plants of open-land habitat will be purchased from a commercial native seed retailer and sowed throughout the project site.
 -   Woody plant management: This is a requirement of the Army Corps of Engineers for flood control reasons. This consideration applies to both native and non-native woody plants. The plants will be removed using the cut-stump method.
 -   Non-native Invasive Plant Removal: The most invasive non-native plant species will be removed using manual, mechanical, biological and chemical control methods. With respect to the biological control methods, it is important to remark that a batch of 500 weevils (Rhinoncomimus latipes) was released in a site adjacent to the streambanks to control mile-a-minute (Persicaria perfoliata). It is expected that the beetle population will increase and expand to the streambanks considering that there is a population of Mile-a-minute established at the sites.
 -   ""Meadow mowing"": This method will be used to control undesirable vegetation without using herbicides and without having to damage the sowed native plants. It will be applied when the vegetation reaches 18 inches in height; the plants will be mowed no less than 8 inches with weed eater once a year. This will favor the sown, open-land-habitat native herbaceous plants to outcompete the non-native plants.

Most of the field work has been done by AWS volunteers supervised by the staff and the specialists that have contributed to the effort. AWS integrates a field work experience with environmental education that brings public awareness to the invasive plant problem, water quality in the Anacostia River watershed, ecological restoration and other subjects. AWS is currently fundraising to implement this project and put into practice the education programs during the research phase. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The Planted Plot has nearly twice the plant species diversity (species richness) of the Control Plot. This is mostly due to the larger number of native species observed within the plot. The Planted Plot was observed to contain 23 naturally occurring native species, half again as many as the Control Plot. It is reasonable to credit greater presence of naturally occurring native species to the management of invasive species, which frees up space and other resources that native plants can use. The diversity advantage of the Planted Plot was enhanced by the survival of 20 of the planted native species. Both individual native plants (35%) and patches of native plants (55%) thrived in the Planted Plot in comparison to the others. The difference is not due to the native plants that were added in March, as only 2 of those were intercepted, and none had made patches. The difference is entirely due to the control of invasive species. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The project is not trying to recover the ecosystem to its historic situation or trajectory; it is trying to establish an alternative plant community in an area where a normal ecological restoration approach is not possible. An overall problem facing this project is the persistence of invasive plant species that come from upriver or whose seedbanks were already established before the project started. Even though there is dominance by the native species as a result of the restoration efforts, invasive species pose an operative burden and cost.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The bulk of the benefits provided by this project fall within the cultural services dimension. The improvement of the urban landscape along a city nature trail, the Anacostia Tributary Trail System, is an important recreation service provided by the project. With the implementation phase of the project, we hope to improve the overall ecological conditions of the trail by providing another important habitat andimproving the urban wildlife watching experiences for parkland users.
1. The Blond Death method of managing the riverbanks nearly eliminates native plant populations and many of the pollinators and wildlife supported by native plant populations.
2. The Blond Death method of managing the riverbanks leaves the river an unsightly centerpiece in a busy park and neighborhood.
3. Summer mowing of the shoulder meadows promotes the growth of tall fescue and will destroy any chrysalises present. Summer mowing allows cool season grasses to flower and set seed before the mowing cycle is complete, while interrupting the reproductive cycle of most native sunny meadow plants. If the support of native plants, pollinators, and bird life becomes an objective of the riverbank management regimen, alternative mowing regimens should be tried.
4. A management regimen that targets the most aggressive alien plants should be considered as an alternative to the Blond Death approach. Results of this approach should be similar to those found in our Planted Plot. This could be done without significantly changing the hydraulic smoothness of the channel, and would return aesthetics and local character to the site. The park would offer far more rewarding butterfly and bird watching opportunities than currently available to visitors.
5. Native plugs should be planted in the fall to prevent exactly what happened in this study: a spring planting followed by a persistent drought. In the event that funds cannot be arranged in time for a fall planting to be organized, a one-year, no-cost extension of a grant is preferable to a spring planting.
6. As long as the Blond Death management plan continues, vines that survive the glyphosphate broadcast should be spot-killed to prevent the evolution of herbicide-resistant plants. Given the highly disturbed condition of the site and the flood prevention management practices carried out by the public institutions, this site will be under human assistance for an indefinite period of time, especially when it comes to woody plant removal to prevent increased levels of channel hydraulic roughness. The successful establishment of a soft-stemmed native herbaceous plant community will be critical for controlling non-native and woody plants without having to incur large expenditures. Even though the plot is not currently under systematic biological monitoring procedures, a checklist of the plant species found (both native and non-native) is recorded each year. During the implementation process, different management methods will be tested to find the method that best meets the goals in a cost-effective manner. For the long-term monitoring component, AWS will partner with academia to assess the benefits of the proposed vegetation management for wildlife species and flood prevention management purposes. "

The project uses Galerucella calmariensis and G. pusilla beetles and larvae as a biological control agent to control and reduce the presence of exotic, invasive Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) in the Fowl Meadow wetlands and surrounding area. The project is implemented by a partnership of the 501c3 nonprofit organization the Neponset River Watershed Association and the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation – South Region, with significant help from a large corps of volunteers. Project guidance is provided by the Wetlands Restoration Program (recently re-named the Division of Ecological Restoration) of the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management. Through reducing the presence of Purple loosestrife in the extensive Fowl Meadow wetlands, we hope to encourage the growth of native wetland plant species, the improvement of habitat for native wetland wildlife, and the return of native wetland wildlife. The project has provided an opportunity to educate local communities and the Metro Boston public about local wetlands (i.e., wetland “health”, what lives in wetlands, how wetlands are significant, and how to be a good wetland neighbor and steward); native vs. exotic, invasive species; and biological control agents. Now in our third project year, we have observed significant effects on the Purple loosestrife populations in our wetland treatment sites and also in surrounding wetlands. Purple loosestrife is visibly fed upon and damaged by the biocontrol insects, is shorter and sports far fewer than normal (if any) flowers during the growing season. We are looking forward to implementing the next several years of this project and observing more of the outcome.Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) The wetlands have been degraded by infestation by Purple loosestrife, hydrology changes due to ditching and surrounding development, and pollutants received via stormwater runoff, among other factors. The majority of the project treatment area consists of a freshwater wetland complex (forested and shrub wetlands and freshwater emergent wetlands [wet meadow]) in the floodplain of the Neponset River. Implementing regular site monitoring and inventories of plant and animal species at the project sites will help to describe and track changes, as will comparing the data to data gathered from similar species surveys prior to the start of the project, and to data gathered at other, similar wetland sites. Fowl Meadow has been known to host endangered, threatened and special concern species, and has been designated part of an Area of Critical Environmental Concern. The site also is a popular public destination for passive recreation and education. Unfortunately, exotic, invasive Purple loosestrife has a strong presence in the Fowl Meadow wetlands and in other local wetlands. Through reducing the presence of Purple loosestrife in the extensive Fowl Meadow wetlands, we hope to encourage the growth of native wetland plant species, the improvement of habitat for native wetland wildlife (including an endangered species previously recorded at Fowl Meadow), and the return of native wetland wildlife. Landowner the MA DCR was supportive of implementing the biocontrol project at Fowl Meadow and Brookwood Farm, with guidance from the Wetlands Restoration Program (WRP) of the MA Office of Coastal Zone Management. WRP helped us to determine project goals and strategy. Local communities in which the specific treatment sites are located also have been supportive of this project to control an exotic, invasive species, including the Towns of Milton and Canton and the City of Boston.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
This project is implemented by the Neponset River Watershed Association with the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation – South Region. We receive project guidance from the Wetlands Restoration Program (now called the Division of Ecological Restoration) of the MA Office of Coastal Zone Management. Volunteers from the communities surrounding the project sites help to implement the project. These volunteers consist of local residents, classes at local schools, members and staff of local environmental conservation organizations, staff of other local organizations, and more. Project partner the MA DCR is the landowner of our treatment sites.

Description of Project Activities: This is a 5-year project. We are following project protocols provided by the Wetlands Restoration Program of the MA Office of Coastal Zone Management, Cornell University, University of Connecticut and University of Minnesota. In Project Year 1: We selected treatment sites, set-up study plots, and in the late spring, monitored study sites. We purchased biocontrol beetles from a beetle-supplier and released these beetles in the field during the summer. In the late summer/early fall, we monitored the field sites. In Project Year 2, we recruited volunteers, trained them to cultivate biocontrol insects, and purchased seed biocontrol beetles. Throughout the spring and early summer, we worked with the volunteers to raise the insects. We also monitored the treatment sites. In the early summer, we released the cultivated beetles at the field sites. In the late summer, we monitored the sites. Now in Project Year 3, we plan to repeat the project activities of Year 2. Please contact NepRWA for more information: 781-575-0354, staff@neponset.org. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Now in our third project year, we have observed significant effects on the Purple loosestrife populations in our wetland treatment sites and also in surrounding wetlands. Purple loosestrife is visibly fed upon and damaged by the biocontrol insects, is shorter and sports far fewer than normal (if any) flowers during the growing season. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The Fowl Meadow wetlands are affected by a variety of factors - e.g., presence of exotic, invasive species; decades-old man-made changes to hydrology; pollutants; surrounding development and impermeable surfaces; etc. Also, there is only a limited number of local staff, staff time and funding available to work towards correcting problems in Fowl Meadow.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Hands-on participation in the project, whether in the form of site-monitoring, Beetle-Ranching, or any number of other project activities, has provided volunteers of a variety of ages, backgrounds and affiliations with a way to fully engage in a local environmental conservation project. Additionally, we have heavily publicized the project via on-line pictures and text, mass e-mails, newspaper stories, radio and TV. Thus, many people who have not had hands-on experience in the project have benefited from seeing, hearing and reading about the local wetland restoration project.
We look forward to conducting a full project evaluation at the end of the five-year project in 2012. For information on long-term land management, contact landowner the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) – South Region or the Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) Program.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-texas-lavaca-bay-restoration-point-comfort-calhoun-county/	USA: Texas: Lavaca Bay Restoration, Point Comfort, Calhoun County	United States of America	2001-02-05	2010-02-05	"From the late 1960s to early 1970s Alcoa (Alcoa, Inc and Alcoa World Alumina, LLC) operated a chlorine-alkali processing unit at its Point Comfort, Texas, plant that discharged mercury into Lavaca Bay. Coal tar processing contaminated other areas around the facility with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In 1988, a portion of Lavaca Bay was closed for the taking of finfish and crabs for consumption after mercury levels in these resources were found to exceed levels considered safe for human consumption.A trustee council, made up of representatives of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC), the Texas General Land Office (TGLO), the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), was established to review, select, and oversee implementation of restoration actions for natural resources injured by the release of mercury and PAHs. A comprehensive restoration plan was developed and Alcoa implemented a suite of projects in and around the bay to compensate for natural resource losses resulting from the site contamination. A staged approach to restoration was adopted with the first stage focused on recreational fishing service losses. To offset these losses, three fishing piers were constructed, a boat ramp was replaced, two timber docks were built and an existing jetty was modified to improve access and enhance recreational fishing opportunities in the bay. The second stage focused on natural resource injuries and service losses of an ecological nature. To restore these losses, 729 acres of land were purchased for transfer to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for preservation as part of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, 70 acres of inter-tidal salt marsh were created within the refuge and 11 acres of new oyster reef habitat were created in Lavaca Bay.The restoration projects implemented by Alcoa were identified through an expedited natural resource damage assessment (NRDA) process that was undertaken cooperatively with Alcoa and the natural resource trustees. The cooperative assessment process permitted comprehensive coverage of all NRDA issues associated with the site and led to good working relationships between federal/state partners, Alcoa, and the local community.Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological) From 1966 to 1970, the Alcoa Point Comfort (PCO) facility discharged mercury – containing wastewater into Lavaca Bay from its chlor-alkali processing operations. Alcoa terminated the direct discharge of this wastewater into the bay in 1970 after the Texas Water Quality Board notified Alcoa of potential adverse environmental impacts associated with this discharge. Other areas around the facility were also contaminated with PAH as a result of processing coal tar. In April 1988, the Texas Department of Health (TDH) issued a “˜closure order’ prohibiting the taking of finfish and crabs for consumption from a specific area of Lavaca Bay due to elevated mercury concentrations found in these species. The site was placed on the National Priorities List in 1994. Placement on this list was primarily based upon levels of mercury found in several species of finfish and crabs in Lavaca Bay, the fisheries closure imposed by TDH in 1988 and the levels of mercury detected in bay sediments in areas adjacent to the PCO facility.
The trustees used the Habitat Equivalency Analysis (HEA) method (Unsworth and Bishop, 1994) for scaling the size of the restoration actions to compensate the public for lost services from injured natural resources. HEA considers the loss or reduction in services provided by resources as the injury “measure”. Therefore, the trustees estimated how the mercury and PAHs could influence the ability of resources to provide ecological services.
The concept of using ecological services as the injury measure is relatively complex. One key concept underlying this approach is that natural resources in an ecosystem are interrelated through the services upon which they depend or provide. Ecological services can be identified as “the functions performed by a natural resource for the benefit of another natural resource and/or the public”. Thus, benthic invertebrates provide a “food” service to fish which consume them, and fish in turn provide a “recreational fishing” service to the public. Connections among physical resources, between physical and biological resources and services they provide for Lavaca Bay marshes are depicted in File#3.
The interrelationships among natural resources in the Lavaca Bay ecosystem were the cornerstone of this assessment. The trustees considered the effect of habitat contamination on resources dependent upon that habitat by determining reductions in likely service flows from that habitat, rather than by trying to directly assess injury to the dependent resources. This approach is consistent with a restoration-based assessment, where the focus is on the restoration of resources and services.
The HEA method requires the development of injury parameters to quantify lost habitat resources and services. The parameters needed to estimate losses within the HEA framework include the area of habitat injury, the degree of injury within that habitat, and how that degree of injury changes over time. The degree of injury is determined by the condition of key or representative resources or services in the habitat (for example, primary production or macrofaunal density). The losses are quantified by year, as lost service acre-years, where a service acre-year is the loss of one acre of habitat and its associated resources and services for one year. To make losses that occur in different time periods comparable, a discount factor is applied to the losses to determine discounted service acre-years (DSAYs). Using this methodology the discounted habitat losses were determined to be 747.12 DSAYs for Dredge Island Marshes, 489.5 DSAYs for other marshes and 244.72 DSAYs for oyster reef (see NOAA, 2001a for more information).
Other parameters are necessary to quantify the benefits of restoration actions in a HEA. They include when the habitat restoration project begins, the time until the habitat provides full services, the level of services provided between the time when the project begins and when it provides full services, and the relative services of the created or enhanced habitat compared to the injured habitat before the incident. Given the size of a project and the discount rate, these parameters define the discounted service acre-year benefits that result from the restoration action. The task is to determine the size of the projects (scale) such that the discounted service acre-year benefits just offset the discounted losses. It was determined that the creation of at least 9.3 acres of oyster reef and at least 61.3 acres of marsh would be needed to compensate the public for interim ecological losses from contamination and response actions initiated through the end of 1999. For additional details concerning the scaling calculations, see the Lavaca Bay Injury Quantification and Restoration Determination Technical Memorandum (Trustees, 2000).
The trustees developed a random utility model to estimate the recreational fishing service losses due to the fishing closure and the benefits from the implemented restoration actions (see Adamowicz, Louviere and Williams, 1994 and Adamowicz et al., 1997 as examples). Typically, a random utility model determines the change in value of a recreational trip for a change in an environmental condition at a recreation site. If a site’s environment is degraded, the model estimates the lost value per recreation trip resulting from the degradation. Likewise, for an environmental improvement at a recreation site, the model determines the added value per trip resulting from the improvement. Because the values are defined in a common metric, i.e., dollars, it is possible to add lost values for different degraded environments and to compare these lost values with values gained from environmental improvements. Based on the values calculated using this model, the trustees determined that the recreational restoration projects constructed (i.e. three fishing piers, replacement boat ramp, two timber docks and a modified jetty) were sufficient to fully compensate the public for all the recreational fishing losses resulting from the release of contaminants at the ALCOA PCO Site (see NOAA, 2001b, appendix B for more information). Lavaca Bay contains a variety of habitats, including intertidal mudflat, fringe marsh, high marsh, oyster reef, and open water, which support a large array of plant and animal species. Submerged vegetation is largely absent from Lavaca Bay, but shoalgrass (Halodule wrightii) and wigeongrass (Ruppia martitima) have been found on the southern shoreline of Keller Bay (Adair et al., 1994). Important habitats for many species include perimeter salt marshes, oyster beds, and freshwater marshes found in upper Lavaca Bay, Cox Bay, and Chocolate Bay. Smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) is prevalent around the northern section of the Dredge Island and along parts of the shoreline in proximity to the Alcoa Point Comfort (PCO) facility. It also occurs in mixed stands with other marsh grasses in upper Lavaca Bay near the mouth of the Lavaca River, and in portions of Cox Cove and Keller Bay. Marsh-hay cordgrass (Spartina patens) is found in the upper reaches of Keller Bay. Other marsh plants, such as shoregrass (Monanthochloe littoralis), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), back rush (Juncus roemerianus), saltwort (Batis maritime), and glassworts (Salicornia spp.) are found along the shores and inland reaches of upper Lavaca Bay. Phytoplankton, zooplankton and aquatic invertebrates living in these habitats provide food web support for a diversity of fish and bird species. In addition, to providing food, these habitats provide nesting services for birds such as the seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritime), black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis), and yellow rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis). There are also extensive oyster reefs in Lavaca Bay that provide habitat and food for a number of fish and invertebrate species and filtration of the bay waters (NOAA, 2001a).
Prominent aquatic invertebrates in river-influenced areas include the bivalve Rangi cuneata, chironomid insect larvae, oligochaetes, and the polychaete Streblospio benedicti (Gilmore et al., 1974). The upper portion of Lavaca Bay contains benthic assemblages of invertebrates typified by brackish water species of mollusks, amphipods, and polychaetes while the bivalves Macoma mitchelli and Mulinia lateralis and the polychaetes Mediomastus californiensis, Glycinde solitara, and Paraprionospio pinnata are abundant in the more saline parts of the bay (Kalke and Montagna, 1991). Dominant organisms found during the Prey Item Study for Lavaca Bay were the polychaets Mediomastus ambiseta, Capitella capitata, Parandalia fauveli, Laeonereis culveri, and Neanthes succinea and the bivalve Tagelus plebeius (Alcoa, 1998a). Larger invertebrates found in much of Lavaca Bay include blue crab (Callinectes spapidus), white crab (Litopenaeus setiferus), brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus aztecus), American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) stone crab (Menippe adina), mud crabs (family Xanthidae), fiddler crab (Uca spp.), lightening whelk (Busycon sinistrum), Atlantic brief squid (Lolliguncula brevis), and cabbage head jellyfish (Stomolophus meleagris). The first four of these invertebrate species are important to commercial and recreational fishing (Robinson et al., 1997).
A wide variety of fish species are found in Lavaca Bay. The most abundant species include Atlantic croaker (Micropgonias undulates), spot (Leiostomus xanthurus), bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), hardhead catfish (Arius felis), gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), striped mullet (Mugil cephalus), killifishes (Fundulus spp), sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegates), sand seatrout (Cynoscion arenarius), gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus), spotted seattrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), sheepshead (Archosargus probatochephalus), black drum (Pogonias cromis), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and southern founder (Paralichthys lethostigma) (Campbell et al., 1991; Robinson et al., 1997).
Approximately 300 bird species inhabit Lavaca Bay ecosystems. Several waterbird colonies have been indentified and monitored on or near the Site, including wading birds such as the roseate spoonbill (Ajaia ajaja), great blue heron (Ardea Herodias), little blue heron (Egretta caerulea), tricolored heron (Egretta tricolor), great egret (Casmerodius albus), snowy egret (Egretta thula), willet (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus), and black-necked stilt (Himantopus mexicanus); floating and diving birds such as the white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos), brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) and double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus); and aerial searching birds such as the Forster’s tern (Sterna forsteri), black skimmer (Rhynchops niger), royal tern (Sterna maxima), bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus),and laughing gull (Larus atricilla). Many species, particularly grebes, loons, ducks and geese, use the bay habitats during the winter but migrate North during the remainder of the year. Small dredge islands created by channel maintenance in the bay provide isolated nesting locations for several breeding bird species (NOAA, 2001a).
Estuarine organisms of commercial, recreational, and ecological importance typically have inshore and offshore components to their life histories (exceptions include the American oyster with an entirely estuarine life cycle). Many species in the Lavaca Bay estuary spawn offshore or near estuary passes, and their larvae migrate into estuarine nursery areas to grow and develop prior to offshore migration and maturation. Other taxa such as birds use estuarine habitats for seasonal feeding, refuge, and/or reproduction (NOAA, 2001a).
Numerous endangered and threatened species are seasonal or occasional visitors to the Lavaca-Matagorda Bay coastal ecosystem. Many of these species- including the reddish egret (Egretta rufescens), white-faced ibis (Plegadus chichi), wood stork (Mycteria Americana), whooping crane (Grus Americana), Arctic peregrine falcon (Falco peregrines tundrius), piping plover (Charadrius melodus), Eskimo curlew (Numenius borealis), green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), Kemp’s ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys kempi), loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), Texas tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri), scarlet snake (Cemophora coccinea), and South Texas siren (Siren sp. 1)- have been documented in Calhoun County (Campbell, 1995; Poole and Riskind, 1987; Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 1988, 1993). Most of these species would be present in Lavaca Bay only during migration through the area.
Lavaca Bay is a valuable cultural resource due to its history and the significant amounts of recreational fishing the system supports. It is a popular spot for saltwater anglers, offering numerous fishing access points in Point Comfort, upper Lavaca Bay, Port Lavaca, Chocolate Bay, Magnolia Beach, and Keller Bay. These sites differ from one another in terms of facilities, access, aesthetics, and available species of fish. These human activities are dependent upon the condition of the coastal and marine habitats. The overall goal of the restoration was to make the environment and public whole for injuries to natural resources and/or service losses resulting from the releases of hazardous materials and clean-up activities at the site. The restoration addressed the recreational fishing service losses by increasing and improving angler access in Lavaca Bay. Ecological service losses were compensated through in-kind restoration (e.g. the creation of a new marsh to compensate for lost marsh services) of marsh and oyster reef habitats. The trustees determined that restoration actions would be required to return the ecosystem to baseline conditions as the resources were not expected to recover in a reasonable amount of time without human intervention.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The designated natural resource trustee agencies involved are the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the US Department of Commerce, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC), the Texas General Land Office (TGLO), the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) on behalf of the US Department of the Interior (DOI) (collectively, “˜the trustees’). TPWD was the lead trustee on the project.
Restoration alternatives were evaluated by the trustees, experts from industry, and restoration scientists, to determine the best options to compensate the public for recreational fishing losses and ecological services impaired or lost by the release of hazardous materials. Restoration plans were reviewed by interested members of the public and the potential for both on-site and off-site restoration was considered. Decisions guiding restoration implementation and monitoring were developed as a part of a settlement agreement between natural resource trustees and responsible parties. Final authority to make determinations regarding injury and restoration rests solely with the trustees. All restoration activities were completed by Alcoa with oversight by the trustees.

Description of Project Activities: 1) Research and planning
The trustees consulted with local scientists and state agency personnel to obtain perspective on the benefits and feasibility of restoration alternatives.  These efforts were important in assisting the trustees in identifying restoration actions that had the potential to be feasible, had strong net environmental benefits, and met restoration requirements to compensate for injuries resulting from Site contamination.  The trustees also considered public access and recreational opportunities provided by a restoration project as positive attributes.  An additional factor considered was the acceptance of the projects by the community.  Restoration alternatives that were complimentary with other community development plans/goals were considered more favorably.  The trustees determined that the restoration activities must have an ecological and geographical relationship to the injured resources and service losses.  They approached restoration planning with the view that the Lavaca/Matagorda Bay system represented the relevant geographic area for the restoration actions because the injuries and losses occurred in that area.  The suitability of potential restoration sites was evaluated through site visits, aerial overflights, and ground surveys.  The Trustees held public meetings in Port Lavaca to solicit public input and suggestions for restoration activities and sites prior to and after developing the restoration plan.
The restoration alternatives chosen included land purchase, salt marsh and oyster reef creation, construction of fishing piers and docks, and improvements to an existing boat ramp and jetty.  Performance criteria and monitoring events for each project were established.  Although a monitoring program increased the cost of the restoration, it was necessary as knowledge of the status of early restoration actions was critical in determining the need for maintenance and corrective actions to ensure that the long-term project goals were attained.

The Whitmire Property, 729 acres (see File #2, area labeled ""Habitat Preservation Location""), was purchased and will be transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for addition to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge where it will be protected and preserved for the ecological services it provides.  Transfer of this property will occur within thirty days following the certification of the marsh restoration project by the lead trustee.  The parcel contains about 60 acres of estuarine marsh habitat, 205 acres of upland coastal prairie and shrubland, 78 acres of freshwater marsh and transitional shrubland, and an approximately 370 acre shallow freshwater lake.

Marsh Restoration (See Consent Decree Exhibit 3 Marsh Implementation Plan in links section, below)
Intertidal marsh was created along the northshore of Powderhorn Lake.  The marsh was created by scraping down an area of approximately 31 acres of existing land to appropriate elevations for planting marsh vegetation and creating tidal channels.  The soil from the 31 acres was placed into Powderhorn Lake to create approximately 39 additional acres of marsh.  A breakwater was constructed on the southern edge of the created marsh to protect against erosion.
Once the construction was completed and the area was ready for planting, Spartina alterniflora plugs were planted on 5 foot centers where the elevations were appropriate for this species.  Spartina patens was planted at higher elevations in 2 to 3 rows, on 3-5 foot centers.  The marsh contains both primary and secondary channels and 25% open water in the area constructed on existing land and 35% open water in the area constructed in existing water.  To maximize function, the marsh was constructed so that no planted areas are more than 10 meters from a primary or secondary channel.

Oyster Reef Restoration (See Consent Decree Exhibit 4 Oyster Reef Implementation Plan in links section, below)
An 11 acre oyster reef was constructed in the southeast portion of Lavaca Bay near the pass between Keller Bay and lower Lavaca Bay, adjacent to natural reefs and scattered oyster clusters.  It is composed of 27 parallel segments, perpendicular and/or diagonal to the tidal currents, separated by 50 foot wide gaps of open bay bottom.  The reef was constructed from limestone base rock placed on top of geotextile filter fabric.  After settling, the top of the reef base was on average 12 inches higher than the surrounding bay bottom, with no spot less than 6 inches, to prevent burial by natural sedimentation.  All activities were completed from April 13 through May 2, 2005 prior to the June spawning peak so that clean substrate was available for the oyster spat.

Recreational Projects (See Consent Decree Exhibit 5 Recreational Projects Implementation Plan in links section, below)
To compensate for recreational fishing loses, three fishing piers, one each at Six-Mile Park, Point Comfort, and Port Lavaca Bayfront were constructed.  In addition an existing auxiliary boat ramp was replaced, two timber docks were built and an existing jetty was modified to improve access and enhance recreational fishing opportunities in the bay.  The projects were designed consistent with current engineering standards for piers and docks on the Texas Gulf coast to achieve a 30-year life span.  Surveys were conducted to document utilization of these projects.  The surveys were for information purposes only and no corrective actions were conducted based upon the results.

3) Results
Marsh Restoration (See Phase 1 Marsh Monitoring Report in links section, below)
The constructed marsh has been monitored to determine percent foliar cover, as well as ensure the primary channels remain free flowing and the low water depth in no less than 0.5 feet.  After an initial vegetation survival survey in December 2006 corrective action was taken to reduce erosion across the transition zone.  Some areas of the marsh have required the addition of fertilizer and replanting.  The results of the 2008 monitoring indicate that the average percent foliar cover was 85.5%, the marsh acreage determined through aerial photography was 72.1 acres, all of the channels met the flow requirements outlined in the consent decree, and the breakwater was performing exceptionally well.  The marsh has developed to the point where no further corrective action is anticipated.

Oyster Reef Restoration (See Oyster Reef Ecological Performance Evaluation Report in links section, below)
After at least 70% settlement, the reef had a suitable solid base with a surface elevation that was on average 12 inches higher than the surrounding bay bottom and no individual spot was less than 6 inches above the bay bottom.  The combined areal size of the reef segments was at least 10.9 acres.  Data collected at 14 sampling stations distributed over the reef complex has indicated that the entire reef is providing oyster habitat.  Oysters dominated the organisms found on the rocks collected at the sample sites and, based on the abundance of small oysters and oyster spat, the construction of the reef was timed very well and the oyster set was excellent. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Oyster Reef
The oyster reef restoration will not required further restoration activities and has been certified by the lead trustee.

Marsh
The marsh system is steadily maturing into a productive self-sustaining estuarine ecosystem and supports a variety of aquatic, avian, and terrestrial wildlife species.  The abundance of birds and fish in the Alcoa marsh, compared with the abundance of wildlife in surrounding marshes, suggests that the Alcoa marsh is as attractive to coastal wildlife as any of the natural marshes in the area.  The resiliency of the restoration was demonstrated in 2008 when the marsh was inundated by Hurricane Ike.  Despite minor debris deposition, there was no change in the percentage of foliar cover.  Monitoring will continue and the marsh restoration will not be considered complete until the planted areas continue to have at least 75% foliar cover and this condition is maintained without major corrective action for a period of two years.

Recreational Fishing
The projects constructed have been extremely popular with the public and are providing the increased access for which they were designed (Rice, personal communication).

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Marsh Construction
Constructing the marsh has provided ecological services (e.g. fish spawning and nursery habitat, nutrient cycling, erosion control, shorebird nesting and loafing habitat, etc) similar to those lost due to the hazardous material release.  The marsh also provides recreational opportunities such as bird watching, walking and nature study.

Oyster Reef Restoration
Establishing the oyster reef has provided ecological services (e.g., water filtration, benthic-pelagic coupling from feeding activity; food for fish and invertebrates that prey upon molluscan larvae and seed, benthic biomass; and habitat value) similar to those functions lost due to the hazardous material release.  The oyster reef also provides recreational fishing opportunities that were lost due to the fishery closure imposed as a result of elevated contaminant levels.

Recreational Projects
In addition to the improved access and additional fishing opportunities provided by the docks, piers, etc., all of the projects benefit non-anglers by providing or enhancing opportunities for other recreational activities, such as boating, walking, picnicking and bird watching.  The projects also help support existing property values and fishing related commercial activities.
The cooperative agreements between Alcoa and the trustees avoided costly and time-consuming litigation and resulted in accelerated investigations and restoration of natural resources and compensation for the lost use of some resources by the public. The parties ultimately agreed to a set of reasonable, conservative assumptions of natural resource injuries and losses based upon available information rather than expending additional time and money on more focused assessment.
Another benefit of cooperative assessment is increased public participation and awareness. Public outreach is a fundamental element of the remedial process under CERCLA (Superfund). By participating in both the remediation and restoration, the trustees were able to capitalize on this opportunity and involve the community in their decision-making. In particular, the trustees were able to review the potential restoration project alternatives during these meetings and select projects with a high potential for success and public approval. Lavaca Bay has been designated as a Superfund Site by the Environmental Protection Agency, and as such, long term monitoring of sediments and fish are required to confirm the recovery of sediment and fish tissue contaminant concentrations to acceptable levels. In addition, monitoring of surface water is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a hydraulic containment system for both mercury and PAH that was installed.
Monitoring of the restoration sites (marsh and oyster bed) is outlined in the consent decree, exhibits 3 and 4, respectively. All of the restorations are required to meet success criteria before the trustees will consider them complete. These success criteria ensure the restorations are on a trajectory to provide the ecological services lost as a result of the hazardous material release as well as demonstrate resiliency for the long term.

In January of 1996 the tank barge, North Cape, struck ground off the coast of Rhode Island spilling approximately 828,000 gallons of No. 2 heating oil into Block Island Sound. The spill caused more than 2.9 million lobsters to wash ashore and the natural resources damage assessment estimated a total of 9 million lobsters were killed from the toxic effects of the oil. A species-specific restoration plan was developed, aimed at increasing local lobster egg production and recruitment. The plan accounted for sex ratio, size distribution, survivorship between life stages, delay between the kill and implementation of the restoration project and time required for growth and maturation of lobsters lost as a result of the spill.The strategy called for 1.248 million legal-size female lobsters to be v-notched and released. “V-notching” refers to the practice of cutting a v-shaped notch in a lobster’s tail to mark the animal for conservation (Attachment 2). Once marked, these lobsters were protected from harvest until the v-notch was no longer present due to molting. Extending the reproductive lives of the notched females allowed an estimated 17.2 billion eggs to be produced which are expected to yield 9 million lobsters replacing those lost by the spill.During 2000, the first year of the project, approximately 300,000 adult female lobsters were purchased from dealers, v-notched and released from a research vessel within a ten-mile radius of Point Judith, Rhode Island. This method of restoration was problematic with non-compliance issues and excessive recapture rates of v-notched lobsters within the restoration area. To correct for these problems a new approach was adopted the following year. With this new method lobster fishermen, accompanied by trained observers, were paid to capture, v-notch, and release female lobsters. These activities were conducted as far as 60 miles offshore and 30 miles east towards Martha’s Vineyard (Attachment 2). This expansion of the v-notching area improved lobster restoration efforts by allowing more fishermen to participate in the program and more widely dispersing the marked lobsters. From 2001 to 2005 the number of female lobsters notched and returned to the ocean each year was approximately 38,000; 212,000; 123,000; 214,000; and 412,000 respectively. In 2006, close to 43,000 female lobsters were notched, with the 1.248 millionth notched by early summer. Data from restoration monitoring has indicated that the lobster population increased 6 percent each month while restoration activities were being conducted.Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological) On January 19, 1996, during a severe winter storm, the tank barge North Cape, carrying 94,000 barrels (3.9 million gallons) of two blends of No. 2 home heating oil, struck ground off Moonstone Beach in South Kingstown, Rhode Island and began to leak oil into the surrounding water. Winds reaching 50 knots formed large, breaking waves that dispersed the oil throughout the water column and into contact with bottom sediments resulting in high concentrations of toxic components (i.e. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) in the shallow waters near shore (French McCay, 2003). A second winter storm five days later brought the oil back into the sensitive intertidal zone, resulting in substantial mortality of marine organisms (Gibson et al., 1997). In total, an estimated 828,000 gallons of the fuel oil were released into the coastal and offshore environments before the North Cape was refloated and moved to Newport, Rhode Island on Friday, January 26, one week after grounding.
Natural resource trustees (See Stakeholder Involvement, below) reviewed the results of over 30 studies of potential resource injuries cause by the spill and consulted with a variety of experts in relevant scientific and technical disciplines. Based on this work, the trustees believed that the spill caused significant injuries to biota in the offshore and salt pond environments and to a variety of birds. While the effect of the oil spill was extensive, this case study is focused on the American lobster mortality and subsequent population restoration.
Data were collected to estimate total lobster losses and the expected time for natural recovery. The studies were designed to evaluate and quantify lobster losses resulting from the acute toxicological effects (immediate mortality) of the spill, delayed mortality and factors affecting the natural recovery of the local lobster population, including migration, larval abundance and egg production.
To estimate the total number of lobsters stranded on the beaches in the spill impact area, transects were set up by Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) on beaches from Point Judith to Charlestown Beach. Sample quadrats along those transects were counted daily, classifying lobsters by sex and size. The areas sampled were swept so that lobsters coming ashore on subsequent days could be identified. The statistical analysis of the data provided an estimate of cumulative (summing daily counts up to February 2 when new strandings had tapered off to negligible levels) lobster abundance on the beach in the affected area. Corrections were made for sampling biases, including lack of observations on the smallest (young-of-the-year) lobsters. Details are provided in Gibson et al. (1997).
Based on this analysis, the trustees estimated that 2.92 million lobsters killed by the spill washed up on the beach (Gibson et al. 1997). The majority of these lobsters (by number) were less than 40 millimeters in carapace length, although about 6,000 legal size lobsters (greater than 82.6 millimeters or 3.25 inches carapace length) were included in the strandings. This number is a lower bound estimate of mortality, as it is extremely unlikely that all lobsters killed by the spill washed ashore.
Total lobster mortality was estimated by diver surveys of lobster abundances performed directly in their habitat (Cobb et al. 1999). The sampling stations were classified as impact (nearest the site of the spill), control (clearly unaffected by oil), and transitional (between control and impact areas) based on reported records of beach strandings of lobsters and results of model simulations of the trajectory of the oil in the sediments.
Comparison of lobster densities in impact and reference areas provided estimates of acute mortality that included both immediate and delayed impacts. During the spring, summer and fall of 1996, diver surveys were made at 21 stations in spill impact and reference lobster habitat (Cobb and Clancy 1998, Cobb et al. 1999). Historical survey data were available from 1991 to 1995 at six sites, three of which were included in the reference sites sampled in 1996. The diver surveys were of two types: airlift samples, used to count the smallest lobsters (less than 60 millimeters carapace length); and visual counts, used for larger (greater than 20 millimeters carapace length) lobsters. Abundance by size class was derived from these data for each sample station. Abundances were interpolated to all affected habitat areas, and estimates were made of total lobsters missing from the affected area.
Based on these data, the trustees estimated that approximately 9.0 million lobsters were killed by the spill. Roughly 82 percent of the lobsters were in their first or second year of life. Legal size lobsters, which are five or more years old, accounted for about 15,300 (0.52%) of the killed lobsters (French 1999). Natural recovery time was estimated to be four to five years for the lobster population to return to baseline levels. This estimate reflected the fact that juvenile lobsters grow to legal size within four to five years after which most are quickly caught by lobstermen. The offshore waters of Block Island Sound support a diversity of fish species including cod, cunner, flounder, skates, tautog and herring. Marine mammals are represented in the Block Island ecosystem by harbor seal communities on Point Judith, Newton Rock and possibly other remote rocky areas. Lobsters, surf clams, starfish, and crabs dominate the marine benthic community. Mussels, sea urchins and sea cucumbers also are resident benthic megafauna. These species are allied with an abundant and diverse benthic microfauna population in the offshore environment.
Moonstone Beach, the site of the grounding, is part of the Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), a highly productive salt pond and wetland system. Cordgrasses (Spartina spp) dominate the salt marsh environment in the salt ponds of Rhode Island, but are accompanied by other plant species such as seaside gerardia and salt marsh bulrush (NAWMP 1998). The marsh vegetation plays an essential role in the coastal ecosystem by generating primary production, trapping sediment, fixing nitrogen and providing habitat for aquatic species.
The salt ponds serve as essential spawning, nursery and growth areas for coastal fish, shellfish, and benthic species (Braczenski et al. 1979, Crawford and Carey 1985, Ganz et al. 1992, Crawford 1990). Other commercially and recreationally important species include striped bass, bluefish, quahogs, oysters and lobsters. Like most estuaries, the ponds are also important links between terrestrial and marine environments, converting terrestrial nutrients into marine biological production; in the shallow, well-lit waters of the salt ponds, benthic activity is an important component of this process (Nixon 1982, Nowicki and Nixon 1985). Silversides, striped killifish, mummichogs, sheepshead minnows, polychaetes and amphipods are important components of the complex food web on the salt ponds.
Rhode Island waters offer considerable economic resources. The coastline along Block Island Sound harbors an extensive network of town and state beaches that supports a large travel and tourism industry. Recreational diving and charter boat fishing also contribute to the local economy. Lobsters, quahogs and winter flounder comprise a sizable portion of the annual fish and shellfish catch. These species are harvested extensively in the Block Island Sound and associated salt pond communities (Olsen and Seavey 1983).
The lobster resource is of particular importance because it supports the most valuable commercial fishery of the Northeast Unites States (ASMFC 2000). Southern New England (Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maryland) is the second largest fishery, and accounted for 21percent of the total US landings between 1981 and 2003 (ASMFC, 2006). An increase in landings began in the 1980’s and continued to record highs from 1997 to 1999 (ASMFC, 2006). Landings subsequently declined for the next six years with record low landings in 2003 comprising only 12 percent of the total US catch (ASMFC, 2006). The goal of the v-notching project was to replace the estimated 9 million lobsters that were killed by the North Cape oil spill through protection of female inshore, Southern New England lobsters. Delaying the harvest of these females was expected to increase egg production leading to increased future juvenile and adult lobster populations. The restoration activities were designed to make the environment and public whole for injuries to natural resources and service losses resulting from the spill. The trustees determined these restoration actions would be required to return the ecosystem to baseline conditions as the resources were not expected to recover in a reasonable amount of time without human intervention. These restoration actions further compensated for resource and service losses for the time between the oil spill and the anticipated return to baseline.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Under the provisions/authority of the Oil Pollution Act (OPA), Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI; represented by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, FWS) were designated as natural resource trustees and had the responsibility to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of natural resources injured as a result of the North Cape oil spill.
The trustees, on behalf of the public, determined the natural resource injuries, planned for appropriate restoration projects, prepared the draft and final restoration plans and implemented and oversaw restoration activities. Restoration plans were reviewed by experts from industry, restoration scientists, and interested members of the public. Decisions guiding restoration implementation and monitoring were developed as a part of a settlement agreement between resource managers and involved parties. Final authority to make determinations regarding injury and restoration rested solely with the trustees.

Description of Project Activities: Research and Planning.
To appropriately scale this project, it was first necessary to determine the number of eggs needed to produce a size distribution of lobsters equivalent to those lost due to the spill.  Trustee analyses indicated that the 9 million lobsters killed were produced from approximately 17.2 billion eggs (French 1999, Gibson 1998).  This estimate was developed using available information on lobster mortality rates, growth rates, sexual maturation and fecundity-size relationships in female lobsters.  Lobster population demographics are considered relatively stable over time (i.e., ""in equilibrium""); it was expected that replacement of 17.2 billion eggs would eventually produce a similar age and size distribution of the lost lobsters.

The next step in the scaling analysis involved estimation of the number of adult females needed to produce the 17.2 billion eggs.  This estimate relied on projections of the length of time lobsters will be protected by the v-notch (v-notches only last between one to two molts), program compliance rates and handling loss.  With regard to the likely duration of V-notch protection, the trustees assumed two years.  This assumption reflected certain identification of the v-notch after one molt and partial recognition after two molts, and an average intermolt period of approximately 1.6 years (Gibson 1998).

Program non-compliance losses were expected to be 50 percent, which is an average over the proposed five-year notching period.  Rhode Island lobstermen were unaccustomed to considering the presence of v-notched lobsters in their harvest, and adaptation to the new program required education, effort, and time.  Therefore, the trustees estimated that 50 percent of restocked lobsters would be harvested inadvertently because of this learning process. Based on the egg equivalence calculation and the program assumptions described above, the trustees estimated that v-notching 0.97 million adult females would be necessary to meet restoration objectives.

The preceding analysis did not account for the lag between the date of injury and restoration.  Female lobsters were reintroduced between four and ten years after the spill and there was a lag before the restocked females produced eggs, that matured to the sizes of the lobsters killed by the spill.  To account for these timing differences, the required number of lobsters was increased by three percent per year for the appropriate number of lag years, resulting in a total of 1.26 million v-notched female lobsters, which were expected to produce 23 billion eggs.  These discounting calculations are described in more detail in French (1999).

In the final step of the scaling calculations, the trustees slightly reduce the 1.26 million female lobster total to account for adult lobsters already introduced into the environment by the responsible party.  By prior agreement with the responsible party, the trustees allowed restoration ""credit"" for lobsters purchased by the responsible party immediately after the spill, tested, and returned to the environment after meeting all state and federal standards.  Trustee records indicate that approximately 12,300 lobsters were purchased by the responsible party for this purpose.  Therefore, the trustees reduced the v-notching requirement from 1.26 million to 1.248 million female lobsters from the inshore, Southern New England population.

Implementation
In order to protect the females and make the v-notch effective, regulations were passed making it illegal to harvest a v-notched lobster.  To be legally protected, the v-notch was required to be 1/4 inch in depth, without any setal hairs (Gibson and Angell 2006).  Rhode Island passed the regulation in 1998, and Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York followed shortly thereafter.
During the first year of the project, approximately 300,000 female lobsters were purchased from dealers, v-notched and released from a research vessel within a ten-mile radius of Point Judith, Rhode Island (For a detailed description of these activities see Attachment 1).

It was soon discovered that, among other complications, the recapture rate of v-notched lobsters within the restoration area was too high; there were too many marked lobsters in too small of an area.  To correct for this problem a new approach was adopted the following year using trained observers and commercial fishermen.

With this new method, trained observers were assigned to lobster boats to accompany fishermen on their trips.  As female lobsters were captured, they were inspected to determine eligibility.  Eligible lobsters had to be legal size, could not be soft shells, could not have visible signs of shell disease, could not be carrying eggs and could not be missing both claws (double culls), (single culls could only constitute 15% of the catch).  If deemed eligible, the lobster was v-notched and released at their capture location.  V-notching took place 32 to 38 weeks of the year, from April to December when lobstermen typically fish.  Eighty vessels and ninety-one observers were used for a total of over 9000 trips.  The lobstermen participating in the program were paid for each released lobster.  These activities were conducted as far as 60 miles offshore and 30 miles east towards Martha's Vineyard.  This expansion of the v-notching area improved lobster restoration efforts by allowing more fishermen to participate in the program and more widely dispersing the marked lobsters.

The observers recorded information on new and recaptured v-notched lobsters including whether or not the recaptures were carrying eggs.  A tagging project was also conducted in conjunction with the v-notch program to gather additional data on v-notched lobsters and allow for ancillary data analysis and monitoring of the restoration program.  Over 35,000 lobsters were equipped with individual tags from 2003 to 2006.  The initial location and date of capture were recorded for all tagged lobsters.  Upon recapture, the date, location, size, shell condition, and presence or absence of eggs was recorded.

Results
From 2001 to 2005 the number of lobsters notched and returned to the ocean each year was approximately 38,000; 212,000; 123,000; 214,000; and 412,000 respectively. In 2006, close to 43,000 lobsters were notched, and the 1.248 millionth lobster was notched by early summer.  Data collected by the on board observers confirmed that the target number of v-notches and intended egg production were achieved.  Analysis indicated that the lobster population increased six percent each month during the restoration program (Stokesbury and Bigelow, 2009).  This suggests that the methods employed in the restoration program were effective at increasing lobster abundance which will lead to increased egg production.  The tagging data offered scientists and marine managers valuable information regarding migration patterns and survival which will aid in lobster management and help to ensure a strong lobster fishery in the future. 

A tank study was conducted to evaluate the effects of v-notching on the lobsters and v-notch retention time.  Results of the tank study indicated that v-notching did not increase mortality or increase the incidence of disease (B. DeAngelis, unpublished data).  However, it was determined that v-notch retention time may be shorter than previously thought.  These results were in agreement with studies conducted by Castro et al.(2003) evaluating v-notch retention.  As a result of these studies, in 2008, fisheries regulations were changed, reducing the size of a protected v-notch from 1/4 inch to 1/8 inch, regardless of setal hair presence in the notch.  This change ultimately increased the protection time of a notched lobster for a minimum of one additional molt. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The v-notching program was successful at increasing the lobster population by six percent each month during the restoration (Stokesbury and Bigelow, 2009) and should lead to increased egg production.  The fate of the additional eggs produced by restocked adult females is uncertain.  The dispersal of lobster larvae by currents makes it difficult to predict settlement locations. In addition, it is difficult to isolate the effects of the restocking program from other environmental and behavioral factors that affect local larval abundances and lobster populations.  However, current and proposed lobster management efforts by state and federal agencies are focused on increasing egg production.  Therefore, the restocking project was consistent with current lobster management measures. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Natural recovery of the lobster population that was expected after the oil spill (Mauseth, 2001) did not occur.  This lack of natural recovery indicates there were other factors that exacerbated the impact of the spill.  In addition, the lobster is heavily exploited and high fishing mortality rates in the US and Canada have raised concerns about its population in general (Castro et al., 2001).  Despite changes in fishing regulations and other management activities there is an overall decreasing trend in the southern New England lobster stock (ASMFC, 2006).  Further management activities will be required to rebuild the stock and sustain the fishery.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The New England lobster fishery is the most valuable commercial fishery in the Northeastern United States (ASMFC 2000).  It supports a regional fishery of mainly small vessels that make day trips in nearshore waters as well as an offshore component.  Restoration of the lobster population was necessary to ensure the resource continues to provide the ecosystem goods and services so important to the region's workforce and economy.
The lobster restoration program has been evaluated through monitoring during the restoration activities and post restoration by the resource trustees and a graduate research project at the University of Massachusetts. Monitoring conducted during the restoration led to corrective actions that improved the efficacy of the restoration activities. Post restoration evaluation of the monitoring methods indicated that the v-notch data effectively documented an increase in lobster abundance and the banding data offered valuable information for studying the local lobster population. However, neither method was designed to evaluate egg production or recruitment. The mark-recapture analysis was not sufficiently robust statistically to estimate ancillary population parameters such as intermolt period and reproductive cycles. Future restoration efforts that rely on v-notching should consider monitoring egg production and recruitment more directly and a more effective design of the banding program would improve statistical analyses. Lobstermen have voluntarily continued to v-notch and release lobsters even though the restoration activities have been completed. This continuation of the marking program should pay dividends in the future and help to maintain the fishery.
Despite the United States’ best efforts to prevent spills, almost 14,000 oil spills are reported each year. The National Oil and Hazardous Substance Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) provides the organizational structure and procedures to prepare for and respond to discharges of oil and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants. The United States Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other organizations employ specially trained emergency response personnel ready to deploy advanced response mechanisms available for controlling oil spills and minimizing their impacts on human health and the environment. Since most spill response equipment and materials are greatly affected by factors such as conditions at sea, water currents, and wind; the key to effectively combating spills is careful selection and proper use of the equipment and materials best suited to the type of oil and the conditions at the spill site. Rapid response to spills and proper use of containment and recovery equipment can reduce the damage to shorelines and other threatened areas. Of equal importance, rapid and appropriate biological response protocols help to minimize injury to biological resources that utilize those habitats. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-indiana-maumee-river-riparian-zone-restoration-allen-county/	USA: Indiana: Maumee River Riparian Zone Restoration, Allen County	United States of America	2000-05-06	2006-01-11	"The Maumee River Riparian Zone Restoration is a reforestation effort on 75 acres of farm land with a goal of restoring riparian bottomland habitat. The restoration plan, developed by the state of Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) and Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), provides compensation for natural resource injuries along the Maumee River resulting from hazardous substance releases from the Fort Wayne Reduction Site. The 35-acre Fort Wayne Reduction Site, a former municipal landfill and waste disposal facility located on the Maumee River east of the City of Fort Wayne, Indiana, was placed on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites in 1986. A settlement agreement with the responsible parties provided for the restoration of 75 acres of farm land located in the Maumee River floodplain to protect approximately one mile of riparian habitat along the river. The plan called for reforestation of bottomland/riparian habitat with native and naturally-occurring tree and shrub species that are tolerant of wet conditions.
After six growing seasons, the area averaged 83 percent total stem survival and had an average of nine different species present. The property was conveyed to a local parks department that has made improvements in public access and has planted additional tree seedlings on the property. The restored riparian habitat has provided a number of environmental benefits, including wildlife habitat, improved water quality, and streambank stabilization as well as recreational opportunities such as hiking, bird watching, and nature studies.Agriculture & Livestock The land was cleared of native vegetation and has been row-cropped in a corn/soybean rotation for more than 50 years despite frequent damaging floods. Prior to clearing of the land for agricultural purposes riparian zones supported a mixture of water-tolerant bottomland hardwood trees and shrubs. These wooded riparian buffer zones protected streams by trapping sediment and pollutants, capturing flood debris, reducing bottomland erosion, improving water quality, enhancing fish and wildlife habitat, improving streambank stability, and helping to reduce streambank erosion. In addition, the riparian forest floor acted like a sponge absorbing both precipitation and runoff. This action helped to reduce flood peaks, recharge the water table, and maintain base flows by storing and slowly releasing excess water. Riparian buffer zones also provided areas for local wildlife to feed and nest.
Restoration of riparian hardwood forests should improve water quality and increase sediment deposition in the riparian zone, seedling survival, occurrence of native tree volunteers, and wildlife use. The project was designed to provide compensation for natural resources injuries along the Maumee River that occurred due to the Fort Wayne Reduction Site. The restoration goal was to permanently retire farm land located in Maumee River floodplain while restoring structural and functional riparian habitat along the river. Specifically, a target of 50 percent seedling survival after five years, with a minimum of five native species represented in the surviving seedlings was selected. This bottomland/riparian reforestation project fits within the context of other basin restoration efforts outlined in the Maumee River Basin Commission Flood Mitigation Master Plan (CBBEL, 1995 and 2008).

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Maumee River basin has a number of organizations (Maumee River Basin Commission, Indiana Natural Resource Commission, Save Maumee Grassroots Organization) working with citizens, government agencies, businesses and industries to restore the health of the basin’s waterways to “fishable and swimmable” conditions. These groups had an interest in the restoration project because it contributed significantly to their ongoing conservation efforts in the watershed.
Under the authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the natural resource trustees (IDEM, IDNR, and USFWS) have the responsibility to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of natural resources injured as a result of the hazardous substance release, and to manage injury-related settlement funds. The natural resource trustees developed the restoration plan with input from the general public and entered into a consent decree with SC Holdings Inc. and Participating Generators Group to resolve all natural resources damages claims arising out of or associated with the Fort Wayne Reduction Site.

Description of Project Activities: (1) Research and Planning;
Restoration alternatives were evaluated by federal and state resource trustees, experts from industry, and restoration scientists to determine the best options to compensate the public for ecological services impaired or lost by the release of hazardous substances.  Restoration plans were reviewed by interested members of the public, and both on-site and off-site restoration options were considered.  Decisions guiding restoration implementation and monitoring were developed as a part of a settlement agreement between resource managers and the involved parties.

The final restoration plan developed by the natural resource trustees used a habitat equivalency analysis approach, similar to that described by Unsworth and Bishop (1994), and an off-site restoration option was selected. 

(2) Implementation; 
This bottomland hardwood reforestation project employed a scheme that resulted in the planting of approximately 25,400 trees, with a density of 540 trees per acre.  The trees were planted every 9 feet within the rows and 9 feet between the rows. The planting density provided a seedling diversity that allowed both natural mortality and natural regeneration of hardwoods and encouraged the establishment of a diverse natural bottomland hardwood forest.

Native water-tolerant trees and shrubs were used to restore the original habitat.  A diverse selection of trees (bur oak, pin oak, swamp white oak, swamp chestnut oak, overcup oak, green ash, sycamore, river birch, shellbark hickory, buttonbush, silky dogwood, and red osier dogwood) were used to allow for micro-changes in topography, soils, and drainage patterns.  All trees were obtained from reputable private nurseries or state nurseries located within the same geographic area (not more than 200 miles away) to prevent problems related to geographic adaptability.  A minimum of eight species were planted.  All nursery material was free of pests and disease.

The project was maintained through herbicide applications to control competing weeds and grasses.  A pre-emergent herbicide was applied in April 2000, prior to the initial planting and again in May 2002, to provide additional weed control and promote establishment of the tree seedlings and shrubs.

The reforested bottomland habitat was to be monitored for a period of five years after completion of the initial planting.  Site visits (two per year) were made between May and October.  Special effort was taken to visit the site during flood events to document the impact on the project area.  The monitoring plan incorporated the following components:
1.Three permanently marked 1-acre transect test plots were established within the reforested areas.  Total percent stem and species survival rates were estimated in each.
2.Three permanent photographic stations were set at key vantage points within the reforested areas and provided visual documentation of site development.
3.Wildlife use was noted through informal surveys.
4.An annual report based upon the results for each year's monitoring was provided to the natural resource trustees.

(3) Education and Outreach;
The property was conveyed to the New Haven-Adams Township Parks Department for inclusion in their natural area/greenways program.  There is a small parking area, and an additional 5,200 tree seedlings have been planted.  A local Boy Scout troop is in the process of establishing nature trails throughout the area to encourage public access.

(4) Results.
75 acres of bottomland have been retired from agricultural production and 47 acres of this bottomland have been planted with native hardwood trees and shrubs.  After six growing seasons, the planted area has averaged 83 percent total stem survival and had an average of nine different species present.  Volunteer tree species and planted seedlings are beginning to provide additional cover for wildlife, and water quality is benefiting from sediment deposition and nutrient removal from the water column. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The high seedling survival rate and species diversity present in the planted area indicate that the resources and processes are in place to successfully restore the riparian forest ecosystem.  Since the cessation of row cropping and the subsequent tree planting activities, the site has been undisturbed and natural vegetation is becoming established.  The results of this project have exceeded the short-term goals with regard to seedling survival, acres reforested, and the addition of a wetland restoration. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Despite the occurrence of frequent flooding, seedling survival has exceeded expectations at the restoration site.  Early in 2008, late winter flooding followed by extreme cold and ice formation caused damage to individual trees.  Most trees successfully generated new growth from stem or roots and there was very little mortality, suggesting resiliency in the restored species.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The establishment of a parking area and natural trails has increased access and provided recreational opportunities to the public.  This restoration project fits well within the activities of the Maumee River RAP, which prescribes watershed actions that will restore aquatic ecosystems and increase the aesthetic and recreational value of the river for the public's use and enjoyment.
Five years of annual monitoring following initial tree planting demonstrated that seedling survival exceeded project goals, and volunteer seedlings of native species (silver maple, red maple, slippery elm, box elder, white ash, green ash, sycamore and cottonwood) were observed in the monitoring plots. By conveying the property to a local parks department improvements in public access were made and long term management of the area will continue. A deed restriction (in the form of a conservation easement) was imposed on the entire 75 acres. The deed restriction prohibits any future alteration of the property which would detract from its intended ecological function. The land use restriction does not, however, restrict the construction and maintenance of walking trails, observation platforms, or similar facilities created for public use. The property was conveyed to the New Haven-Adams Township Parks Department and is included in their natural area/greenways program. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/australia-the-regent-honeyeater-habitat-restoration-project/	Australia: The Regent Honeyeater Habitat Restoration Project	Australia	1996-05-04	2009-05-04	"The Regent Honeyeater Habitat Restoration Project is a landscape-scale community effort to protect and restore all significant remnants of native woodland habitat in the agricultural district of the Lurg Hills, near Benalla, Victoria. Relying heavily on volunteer labour, the project conducts planting activities to revegetate old agricultural fields, enhance the understorey in existing stands of forest, and reconnect isolated forest fragments. While focus is placed on restoring and improving habitat for the Regent Honeyeater, a critically endangered bird species native to these Box-Ironbark forests, many other declining birds and mammals also benefit from the restoration effort. To date, the project has garnered the active support of more than 95% of local landowners and has successfully restored almost 1060 hectares.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation Clearing of the Box-Ironbark forests for agriculture has removed about 85% of the original habitat and left only small, isolated remnants of native plant communities that are often connected only by roadside or streamside vegetation. The areas most affected have typically been those on lower slopes and plains where greater fertility and moisture create more favorable conditions for farming, and yet, it is these same areas that support the greatest diversity and abundance of wildlife.
Subsequent to the initial wave of deforestation for agriculture, much of the remaining forest was cut for timber and firewood during the goldrush era of the 1850s to support the rapid population growth and development of industry. Furthermore, until the 1970s large, old trees were systematically ringbarked in some forests to create a “˜pole’ forest for timber production. This young, pole-forest structure is typical of the Box-Ironbark forest today.
The repercussions of deforestation on the region’s wildlife have become evident, as many species have declined in number and are now considered threatened. The threatened fauna include: the Regent Honeyeater, Grey-crowned Babbler, Bushstone Curlew, Squirrel Glider, Bushtailed Phascogale and Quoll. Many species of plants are also threatened, among them: Deane’s Wattle (Acacia deanei ssp. paucijuga), Drooping Wattle (A. difformis), Ploughshare Wattle (A.gunnii), Silver-leaf Tea Tree (Leptospermum multicaule), and a host of declining native peas including Slender Tick-trefoil (Desmodium varians), Western Golden-tip (Goodia medicaginea), Austral Trefoil (Lotus australis), Broughton’s Pea (Swainsona procumbens) and Leafy Templetonia (Templetonia stenophylla). Among the Box-Ironbark forests and woodlands of Victoria, there are few if any undamaged reference sites to guide restoration work. The project therefore uses roadside linear remnants and the more intact bush areas as a guide to what might have grown on the specific topography of nearby work sites. The accumulated information from 14 years of such observation has enabled project staff to compile a comprehensive planting guide for the different topographies and soils of the whole district.
On the crests and upper slopes of ridges, soils are usually shallow (<10 cm) and stony. They are relatively low in fertility and do not hold water well. Such soils support open, sparse vegetation such as heathy dry forest and grassy dry forest with red stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorhyncha) being the dominant species.
As the soils become deeper on the mid to lower slopes, the Box-Ironbark forest takes over. Common tree species of the Box-Ironbark and Box-Gum Grassy Woodland habitats include: Mugga Ironbark (Eucalyptus sideroxylon), Red Box (E. polyanthemos), White Box (E. albens), Grey Box (E. microcarpa), Long-leaf Box (E. goniocalyx), Yellow Box (E. melliodora), Blakelys Red Gum (E. blakelyi), River Red Gum (E. camaldulensis), and Red Stringybark (E. macrorhyncha). Shrubs include a range of Acacia spp., Bursaria spinosa, Dodonaea viscosa ssp angustissima, Calytrix tetragona, Kunzea parvifolia and Grevillea alpina, with groundcovers including a wide range of native forbs and grasses.
Soils become more fertile and retain more water as the landscape flattens from undulating rises through to alluvial plains. Ecological communities such as low rises grassy woodlands, alluvial terraces herb-rich woodland and creekline grassy woodland are found in these areas. To the north of the Box-Ironbark region, the soils of the northern plains have deep profiles with good drainage, high infiltration rates and high permeability. They originally carried grassy woodlands, dominated by Grey Box (E. microcarpa), White Box (E. albens) and Buloke (Allocasuarina luehmannii).
Over 200 bird species have been recorded in the Box-Ironbark region, including waterbirds and other species that visit local wetlands or occur intermittently in Box-Ironbark forests. Over half the species recorded are considered regular visitors or year-round residents.
Nectar is a major food source in these forests, with different tree species producing nectar at different times of year. Some of the richest forest areas have different tree species flowering all year, allowing them to support resident populations of honeyeaters, including two species characteristic of Box-Ironbark forests–Fuscous Honeyeater (Lichenostomus fuscus) and Yellow-tufted Honeyeater (L. melanops)–as well as the endangered Regent Honeyeater (Xanthomyza Phrygia). When drought inhibits flowering, normally sedentary species may be compelled to disperse and seek food in new habitats. The ebb and flow of nectar-feeding birds to and from the region, and within it, contributes to the unique nature of these forests.
Other characteristic fauna of the Box-Ironbark forest includes: 12 species of frogs, including 3 species of Tree Frogs; 40 reptile species, including skinks, tortoises, geckoes and venomous snakes; and 44 species of mammals, including 13 species of bats, the Arboreal Squirrel Glider, Brush-tailed Phascogale and Yellow-footed Antechinus. The broad aim of the Regent Honeyeater Project (RHP) is to protect and restore all significant remnants of Box-Ironbark and Box-Gum Grassy Woodland habitat in the Lurg Hills and to reconnect them through revegetation. Strategic focus is placed on higher fertility sites while also forming links to drier upland habitats.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Because over 18% of the remaining Box-Ironbark habitat in Victoria lies on private land, the support of private landowners is essential to ensuring its restoration and conservation. Consequently, this project has worked in close collaboration with local landowners in the Lurg Hills area and has garnered widespread support from farmers keen on protecting what remains of the forest. To date, 125 landowners have set aside land for the project and close to 400 sites have been protected. Moreover, local farmers actively participate in the decision making process vis-Á -vis the project management committee, and volunteers from the community play a vital role in the implementation and long-term monitoring of restoration activities.

Description of Project Activities: The project works systematically on a number of integrated fronts using insights from past field observations and the best information available from biologists to guide activities. Work involves: 
 -  protecting remnants by fencing 
 -  removing woody weeds to improve the long-term viability of core habitats 
 -  enhancing understoreys to improve nesting and feeding opportunities for wildlife 
 -  enlarging remnants by add-on plantings 
 -  reconnecting patches either directly or through 'stepping stone' patches 
 -  building biolinks beyond the project area to ensure long-term genetic exchange 

--Fencing--
Some 295 sites have been protected from further disturbance due to livestock with a total of 190 km of fencing. This has included remnant vegetation as well as sites that were planted.

--Planting-- 
With the help of volunteers, the project collects all its own seed and propagates 40-45,000 seedlings each year, including several threatened species and others that are seriously depleted in the region. Each year, propagation and planting days are organised for 1500 students from more than 20 local schools, as well as hundreds of volunteers from universities, walking clubs, church groups, bird observers, scouts and environment groups. Some 400 sites have been planted using over 385,000 seedlings, and 27 sites have been direct seeded. 

Anywhere from 30-40 species of trees, shrubs and ground cover are typically planted at each site, with species selection based on overstorey indicators of the likely pre-existing plant associations. On the more micro level, species are carefully matched to changing soils and moisture levels, as various parts of each site are analyzed. The rich planting mix increases the potential for species to shift dominance up or down slope, as the soil moisture changes in coming decades. The basic planting technique utilized has been developed over years of experience and has been shown to be extremely effective.

A few weeks before a site is planted, the landholder or a local contractor ploughs a series of riplines: deep cuts a metre or so into the soil. Although the ripline closes straight up again, it loosens the soil and encourages the young seedlings to root rapidly and deeply. They only have a couple of months to be ready for the heat of summer, and if the roots are deep enough already, the tiny amount of moisture remaining in the subsoil will be enough to see them through. 

Once the riplines have been plowed, the site is sprayed with herbicide in order to reduce competition from weeds and imported pasture grasses. This step doesn't eliminate weeds altogether, but it sets them back a month or two and gives the seedlings a chance to get established and compete on more even terms. Over the next couple of years, other weeds will colonise the disturbed ground, but over time the newly planted natives will shade them out. 

Ripping and spraying the planting sites has been shown to be effective in promoting natural regeneration in many cases, either from soil-stored seed or recent seed fall from parent plants nearby, and various site treatments (e.g. soil disturbance, spraying, burning) are being tested to accelerate this process. 

On most sites at about this time, the landholder or a contractor will erect a fence to exclude livestock and set the stage for revegetation.

Before the main labour of planting actually begins, the layout team assesses the site to determine what mix of trees and shrubs would best approximate a natural plant community and how they should be positioned. Spacing is an important consideration, as the planting needs to be dense enough to achieve good cover, but not so dense as to waste good tubestock or hinder the development of the smaller and slower-growing species. The layout team also takes special care to put species with particular needs in places where they will grow well. Even on a small site, there is usually a lot of variation between different areas; for example, species like Red Box that thrive on a dry and stony rise will soon drown if planted in the heavy, wet clay near the bottom of the slope where Blakley's Red Gum and the Prickly Tea-tree are at home.

When it's time to begin plating, the top few inches of soil are first removed with a mattock and shovel over an area of about two-thirds of a square metre around each seedling. This is done to eliminate unwanted weeds because although herbicide has been applied, the top layer of the soil is still full of weed seeds. The native plant species are adapted to barren soils and can thrive without this topsoil, while nonnative species will find it more difficult to become re-established.

Finally, once the seedling has been planted, a milk-carton treeguard is fitted around it. The guard helps conserve moisture and protects the seedling from herbivory by rabbits, hares, and kangaroos. The guard has to be anchored firmly, as kangaroos and cockatoos can easily pull out treeguards if they are not weighted down. Clean, weed-free soil left by the planting team is used to cover the treeguard all around to about one-third of its depth and provide added durability. Over the next few years, the treeguard not only discourages hungry herbivores, it also protects the seedling from the elements and functions like a tiny humidicrib, collecting dew and retaining moisture in the soil for hot summer days. Because it is made of cardboard, it will gradually decompose, and by the time the young tree is three or four years old and growing strongly, the guard has completely rotted away. 

Once the seedlings have been successfully planted, they are left on their own to become established. As part of the CMA agreement, the farmers are required to continue weed control and to exclude livestock. In cases where seedling losses are excessive for any reason, the project staff and volunteers install replacement plantings in the second year to ensure the high vegetation density required for target species. 

--Pruning mistletoe (Amyema spp.)--
Mistletoe infestations are a clear sign that natural checks and balances are no longer working. Ten heavily invested sites have been pruned by project participants, and in an effort to enhance natural biological controls, supplemental measures have been undertaken at these sites such as fencing, understorey establishment and nest box installation to attract Common Brush-tailed and Ring-tailed possums. These possums prefer mistletoe over tough eucalyptus leaves, but there are often no tree hollows to provide them with the necessary shelter. Thus, it is hoped that by installing nest boxes in heavily infested bush blocks, the possums will take up residence and help bring the mistletoe back into balance.

--Forest thinning--
Ecological thinning of regrowth 'pole' forests has been carried out (under permit) on one 0.85-ha trial site. The objective is to reduce severe competition for moisture and nutrients and thus enable better flowering and nectar production among the remaining trees. 

--Pest animal control--
Predator reduction is carried out against the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) in order to protect wildlife using the restored sites. Permits have also been arranged for farmers to cull Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) in order to reduce severe browsing of understorey vegetation in remnants and planted areas. Ongoing controls are also carried out for hares and rabbits in the interest of protecting the palatable, nitrogen-fixing peas, wattles and sheoaks.

--Nest boxes--
More than 378 nest boxes have been placed in strategic locations all across the district to provide much needed habitat for important species as well as opportunities for community education and involvement--chiefly through the annual monitoring program. There is an extreme shortage of natural tree hollows due to the heavy clearance of old trees and the immaturity of regrowth forests. Nest boxes therefore provide much needed shelter and breeding sites for such critical species as Sugar Gliders, Squirrel Gliders and Brush-tailed Phascogales. These nest boxes are monitored biannually by volunteers, to record and analyse habitat preferences, seasonal movements and breeding success of target species. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Since its inception in the early 1990s, the project has protected and restored almost 1060 ha of Box-Ironbark habitat, and planted more than 385,000 seedlings. Plantings have shown exceptional survival rates (over 90%), even in dry conditions, and the structural development of the replanted sites is progressing well, despite many years of below-average rainfall.

The project has achieved the rapid closure of numerous high priority gaps in the local habitat network, and is currently connecting the Lurg Hills project area to other major regional habitats nearby. The oldest tree plantings are now more than 12 yrs old and up to 6 m high, with more and more starting to come ""on stream"" in terms of producing flowers and nectar. The first Ironbarks flowered in 2006, and some Eucalypts have even been found flowering as young as 8 years in the more fertile sites. Sites with serious dieback are slowly returning to health through understorey plantings of shrubs and ground covers, and understorey species have been observed regenerating quickly from natural seed fall, especially in sites with native grasses. 

Trials of mistletoe pruning, enrichment planting, and fencing around degraded remnants have shown that stressed trees return to full vigour in 2 or 3 years, and produce copious flowers that are of benefit to Regent Honeyeaters and other important species. 

The gap closure achieved within the district seems to have substantially benefited the Grey-crowned Babbler, as these birds have been observed in 35-40 of the revegetated sites, usually within 5 or 6 years of planting. Many family groups are also moving through the planted corridors, or via ""stepping stone"" planting sites, to join other family groups, a development with critical genetic benefits for the species.

In addition to the Grey-crowned Babbler, the following birds, all widely considered to be rare and declining, have been observed on previously deforested sites revegetated by the project: Brown Treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus), Diamond Firetail (Stagonopleura guttata) Hooded Robin (Melanodryas cucullata), Red-capped Robin (Petroica goodenovii), Speckled Warbler (Chthonicola sagittatus), Painted Honeyeater (Grantiella picta), and Black-chinned Honeyeater (Melithreptus gularis) (D. Ingwersen, Birds Australia, unpub. data 2008). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The Regent Honeyeater has not returned in any great numbers as of yet, as it is still only represented by a very small population at the national level and the revegetated sites are years away from their nectar production peak. Once the planted trees become reliable producers of nectar, however, the likelihood of Regent Honeyeater use of the habitat is expected to rise.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The re-establishment of a healthy, balanced ecosystem promises to benefit local farmers by providing ecosystem services, such as salinity mitigation, erosion control and biological controls for a number of pest problems. An understorey of Silver Wattle, Golden Wattle or Late Black Wattle, for example, attracts Glider Possums in search of the sugary wattle sap. These gliders then feed on Christmas beetles--sometimes eating their own body weight in a single night--and help prevent infestations that would otherwise kill valuable old trees.

Understorey shrubs also provide nesting habitat for many different bird species. Studies have shown that birds can take up to 60% of the available insects in a healthy woodland; therefore, attracting birds is another effective way to help counter insect infestations that lead to forest dieback.

Nectar-rich shrubs like Sweet Bursaria, tea-trees, rice flowers and everlasting daisies attract a range of parasitic wasps and flies that prey on insect pests such as Cockchafer Grubs and Christmas Beetle larvae that destroy the roots of pastures.

Mistletoe infestation has been another problem arising out of ecosystem degradation and imbalance. The natural control agents for mistletoe include certain butterfly larvae and possums--both of which eat the leaves--and a host of birds that eat mistletoe fruit without spreading seeds around the trees. Without a shrubby understorey, there is no habitat for these beneficial animals, and the control mechanism breaks down. Thus, mistletoe proliferates, and the parasitic load eventually kills the trees.
The Regent Honeyeater Project is one of the most active volunteer conservation projects in Australia. It has engaged a whole farming community in restoring remnant Box-Ironbark habitat for the endangered species still living in the district, and attracted ongoing support from a wide cross section of the community to help farmers with the on-the-ground works. Informal monitoring is conducted on an ongoing basis by project staff and landholders, who continually check the progress of restoration sites to anticipate and correct any problems. As part of this process, photo-monitoring has been undertaken at every site to readily demonstrate the dramatic structural changes that are being achieved.
Formal monitoring has also been undertaken each year over the past decade to document the distribution and population of Grey-crowned Babblers (by exhaustive survey) and Squirrel Gliders (by nest box monitoring). Furthermore, Birds Australia has been active in arranging systematic surveys of over 150 sites to document the woodland birds that are using local remnant patches and planting sites. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/spain-el-corredor-verde-del-rio-guadiamar/	Spain: El Corredor Verde del Río Guadiamar	Spain	1998-04-22	2002-04-22	"Ha transcurrido una década desde que la cuenca del río Guadiamar sufriera una de las mayores catástrofes medioambientales del último siglo: el vertido de lodos y aguas ácidas tras la rotura de los muros de la balsa minera en Aznalcóllar, Andalucía. El accidente tuvo trascendencia internacional por su proximidad a uno de los espacios naturales más importantes de Europa, la Marisma Doñana, y la gravedad de la situación exigió que se tomaran decisiones inmediatas y se aplicaran medidas de gran alcance para minimizar las repercusiones ambientales y socioeconómicas generadas. En respuesta a estas circunstancias, la Consejería de Medio Ambiente de la Junta de Andalucía emprendió un ambicioso proyecto de limpieza y recuperación de la cuenca, el cual pretendía no solamente restaurar las condiciones previas al vertido, sino restablecer la integridad ecológica de toda la región mediante un nuevo Corredor Verde que conectara las marismas del litoral y los ecosistemas de Sierra Morena Occidental para salvaguardar los procesos naturales y las relaciones biofísicas de la zona. Las medidas de restauración constaron de la limpieza de todos los cauces y márgenes aguas abajo de la balsa; la corrección de los suelos contaminados através de enmiendas y aportes de materia organic; el restablecimiento de la geomorfología natural del río; y la revegetación con especies autóctonas en determinadas secciones de la cuenca. Un coordinado programa de investigación y seguimiento a largo plazo ha afirmado la eficacia de muchas de estas medidas y en general, los indicadores de calidad ambiental han sido favorables, reflejando un ecosistema en proceso de recuperación.Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry La rotura del muro de contención de la balsa de estériles mineros de la mina de Aznalcóllar, durante la madrugada del sábado 25 de abril de 1998, ocasionó una de las mayores catástrofes ecológicas de las últimas décadas en Europa. Unos 6 millones de metros cúbicos de lodos piríticos y aguas ácidas con altas concentraciones de metales pesados y otros elementos traza como el arsénico, procedentes de los procesos de flotación de la pirita, se vertieron a los cauces de los ríos Agrio y Guadiamar.
Se anegó la ribera del Guadiamar y las tierras colindantes a lo largo de unos 62 km, con una anchura variable de entre 500 y 1000 metros, desde Aznalcóllar hasta Entremuros, en el límite con el Parque Nacional de Doñana, donde quedó retenido casi la totalidad del vertido por una serie de muros de contención. En total se vieron afectadas 4.634 hectáreas, en su mayor parte zonas agrícolas (cereal, oleaginosas, arrozales, algodón, frutales, olivares y cultivos hortícolas) así como pastizales, pertenecientes a nueve municipios de la provincia de Sevilla. De las 4.634 hectáreas, 2.656 pertenecían al Parque Natural de Doñana y 98 ha al Parque Nacional (ambos englobados hoy en el Espacio Natural Doñana).
La incidencia del vertido sobre los hábitats que conformaban el cauce del río y sus riberas fue brutal, siendo mayor sobre la fauna piscícola. De hecho en los primeros días se produjo la desaparición de la totalidad de la fauna acuícola (principalmente carpas, albures y barbos, aunque también ranas y cangrejos) no sólo por los tóxicos disueltos o en suspensión, sino también por el severo episodio de anoxia provocado por la fina granulometría de los lodos. Los ambientes presentes en la llanura aluvial del río Guadiamar también fueron afectados por la riada tóxica en forma importante. Suelos, plantas y fauna edáfica quedaron sepultados por una capa variable de lodos tóxicos, incompatibles con la vida.
A pesar de la destrucción que se vió como resultado del accidente, es de interés recordar que ya se trataba de un río sometido a numerosas alteraciones y un avanzado nivel de degradación. En los últimos 50 años, la intensa presión humana ha comprendido tales disturbios como la eliminación de antiguos brazos, las extracciones de grava, la instalación de barreras transversales y laterales, la invasión agrícola del cauce, el sobrepastoreo, la roturación de márgenes y la contaminación de sus aguas por vertidos urbanos, industriales y, por supuesto, procedentes de la minería. Estas perturbaciones han ido provocando la pérdida progresiva de la mayor parte de los valores naturales y culturales de la cuenca. Los frondosos bosques de ribera que cubrían la cuenca media y baja y la vegetación de las marismas naturales han desaparecido paulatinamente. Además, se ha perdido la variedad morfológica del cauce (meandriforme, cauces entrelazados y comportamiento divagante), convirtiéndolo en un río estructuralmente más simple, casi restringido a un solo cauce principal con un trazado rectilíneo. Como resultado de estos impactos antrópicos y la transformación del territorio, la cuenca del Guadiamar ha perdido las dos funciones más importantes que desempeñaba en su estado primitivo: la de servir de corredor de especies y procesos naturales entre la sierra y el litoral y la de agente primordial en el régimen de inundación de las marismas del Guadalquivir. Más allá de conformarse con restaurar los ecosistemas de la cuenca del río Guadiamar a la situación previa al vertido, este proyecto fue planteado desde una perspectiva integral y con unos objetivos de mayor alcance. Se pretende crear un Corredor Verde que restablezca los procesos naturales entre los paisajes del litoral de Doñana y Sierra Morena Occidental y así, recuperar todo el sistema de relaciones biofísicas y conducir los ecosistemas hacia las condiciones dinámicas originales, previas al accidente minero y a otras importantes transformaciones que ha sufrido la cuenca a lo largo de su historia.
El proyecto también busca compatibilizar el desarrollo de la agricultura, la gestión de los recursos naturales, la mejora ambiental, y el fomento del conocimiento y el contacto con el medio. A fin de cuentas, lo que se busca es poner de acuerdo a la naturaleza y al ser humano através de un modelo de desarrollo sostenible.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Tanto el fomento de la participación ciudadana en el seno de la población afectada como las distintas posibilidades que ofrecen la educación ambiental y la comunicación social, impregnaron en gran medida, desde un primer momento, el Plan de Actuación de la Junta de Andalucía para hacer frente de forma inmediata a las consecuencias del accidente minero.
La participación de personas y colectivos que desde el voluntariado ambiental se sumaron al Plan de Actuación, fue crucial para llegar con éxito hasta las previsiones de recuperación pretendidas. Esta participación, organizada a raíz del accidente y apoyada por diversas ONGs (WWF-ADENA, la SEO, Greenpeace), tuvo lugar en una primera fase de emergencia, en la que las acciones voluntarias de recuperación de la avifauna, huevos y pollos sobre todo, o de seguimiento ambiental de la vegetación, fueron fundamentales. A continuación, desde la Consejería de Medio Ambiente se apoyaron distintas iniciativas y proyectos concretos de participación activa propuestos por asociaciones y grupos de voluntarios.
La culminación de este primer Plan de Actuación o Plan de Medidas Urgentes dio paso de forma natural a un proyecto de futuro, planteado a largo plazo en el que el río Guadiamar comenzaba a ser considerado un sistema complejo (con interacciones humanas y naturales, socio-económicas y paisajísticas) sobre el que sería imprescindible desarrollar la gestión integral de su cuenca.
En base a un estudio de investigación social realizado en los municipios de la cuenca, se desarrolló el Programa de Participación y Educación Ambiental del Corredor Verde, el cual tiene varios subprogramas para fomentar la integración entre las dinámicas humana y natural en la cuenca. Entre estos subprogramas se destaca el Voluntariado Ambiental, iniciado en 1995, como la fórmula estrella de participación activa de los ciudadanos, de forma libre y altruista, para comprometerse en la mejora del medio ambiente mediante acciones concretas, aunque no solo con pequeños logros a corto plazo, sino también con una pretensión de objetivos a medio o largo plazo. Esta fórmula de participación supone un compromiso solidario del voluntario con el medio ambiente y el resto de la sociedad, de modo que su actitud y comportamiento pueden llegar a extenderse al resto de las personas de su entorno y provocar un cambio social proambiental positivo.
Pero la participación debe extenderse a otros sectores de población menos proactivos que los propios voluntarios ambientales y para ello se han diseñado diversos planes de promoción de la participación socio-ambiental y cultural. Desde finales de 1999 se han venido desarrollando distintas Jornadas de Participación e Información sobre el Corredor Verde del Guadiamar, que han estado dirigidas a sectores poblacionales y de actividad concretos. De este modo ya se han celebrado Jornadas dirigidas a representantes municipales, con la colaboración de la Asociación par el Desarrollo Rural Aljarafe-Doñana; dirigidas a los agricultores, con la colaboración de la Unión de Pequeños Agricultores; dirigidas a consumidores y usuarios, con la colaboración de la Federación de Asociaciones de Consumidores y Usuarios de Andalucía o dirigidas al movimiento vecinal, con la colaboración de la Confederación de Asociaciones de Vecinos de Andalucía.
La experiencia derivada de estas Jornadas está convergiendo hacia una comisión consultiva, que se está integrando con representantes de los diferentes municipios implicados y colectivos sociales, perfilándose en la misma la figura de los mediadores sociales o personas implicadas y la red de entidades vinculadas a la participación activa.

Description of Project Activities: La recogida de lodos se inició el 3 de mayo, 8 días después del accidente. Los trabajos duraron unos siete meses, hasta el 30 de noviembre. En total se extrajeron unos 7 millones de metros cúbicos de lodos y tierras contaminadas, que fueron depositados en la antigua corta de la mina de Aznalcóllar, tras los informes pertinentes de viabilidad aportados por el Instituto Tecnológico Geominero.

La limpieza de cauces y márgenes supuso un reto importante. Buena parte del cauce permaneció durante meses cubierto de aguas, por lo que las labores de limpieza eran muy complejas, hubo que esperar al verano para que estas labores resultaran más fáciles de acoÂ¬meter. Aquellos fragmentos anegados, incluso en verano, fueron sometidos a un proceso de drenado y desecación al objeto de que la maquinaria pesada pudiera operar con eficacia. Los taludes fueron limpiados con especial cuidado de no interferir con la morfología del propio río. 

Mención aparte requirieron las acciones sobre las graveras abandonadas, sobre ellas se acumularon grandes cantidades de lodos, por lo que tuvieron que ser objeto de una más intensa labor de limpieza, sobre todo por el hecho de que estas zonas eran puntos vulnerables como lugares de posible contaminación a los acuíferos sobre las que se ubicaban.

El agua embalsada en la zona de Entremuros fue tratada por una depuradora construida al efecto. Hasta tres meses después del accidente, el día 24 de julio, no se inició el desembalse, una vez ya depurada, a las marismas del Guadalquivir. A mediados de septiembre se concluyó el tratamiento y desembalse de aguas, desmontándose los equipos y las infraestructuras.

El almacenamiento del agua durante más de tres meses provocó la contaminación por metales pesados de la vegetación y de la capa superficial del suelo. Tras la depuración de las aguas, la zona fue objeto de actuaciones de recuperación en los últimos meses de 1998, que consistieron en la retirada de toda la vegetación y de la capa superficial del suelo. En octubre, siguiendo las recomendaciones de técnicos y científicos, se iniciaron los tratamientos de suelos mediante enmiendas calizas para la neutralización e inmovilización de la contaminación residual y estabilización del sustrato edáfico.

La decisión de adquirir la titularidad de los terrenos afectados por el vertido se adoptó por el Gobierno de la Junta de Andalucía sobre la base de criterios técnicos, tanto ecológicos como sanitarios y económicos. Ciertamente, el alcance y proyección de las labores de restauración emprendidas planteaban conflictos con la preservación de la propiedad privada que, en cualquier caso, tendría que verse condicionada por severas limitaciones, que en la práctica supondrían una limitación indefinida de derechos.

Además, aunque las cosechas contaminadas por el vertido fueron destruidas y las explotaciones en zonas de riesgo suspendidas, la extensa repercusión mediática de la catástrofe afectó a la comercialización de productos agrarios y pesqueros de todo el Bajo Guadalquivir. Frente a unas 3.000 hectáreas agrícolas afectadas, más de 80.000 podrían estar bajo sospecha. La gravedad de la situación y la necesidad de devolver la tranquilidad tanto a la población como a los mercados, hizo que el Gobierno de la Junta de Andalucía adoptara la importante decisión de retirar definitivamente de la producción agrícola la totalidad de la superficie afectada.

El proceso de adquisición de tierras se efectuó en dos etapas. En una primera fase se abrió un procedimiento de venta voluntaria, tramitado por la Consejería de Agricultura y Pesca, y en una segunda de expropiación forzosa, bajo la responsabilidad de la Consejería de Medio Ambiente. De hecho, fue la primera expropiación de tierras llevada a cabo en España por motivos estrictamente medioambientales.

Una vez retirados los lodos y adquiridos los terrenos se procedió a un intenso proceso de caracterización de los suelos, mediante muestreos, análisis y posterior cartografiado de los resultados. El objeto no era otro que el de concretar de manera eficaz las medidas de corrección que sobre ellos había que realizar. Se tomaron muestras de fondo y superficie, así como de aquellos lugares que no fueron afectados para que sirvieran de blancos de referencia. Se evaluó el contenido de metales pesados y otros elementos traza como el arsénico, así como otras variables indicadoras de la naturaleza del sustrato edáfico como el contenido en S, en varias de sus formas, o en nutrientes esenciales para la vegetación como el fósforo o el nitrógeno. 

Como resultado de los análisis efectuados se estimaron una serie de medidas correctoras encaminadas a la recuperación de los suelos, los cuales estaban desprovistos de vegetación en su mayor parte, con restos de elementos traza y con un notable desequilibrio edáfico (pH y ausencia de materia orgánica). Además, hay que tener en cuenta que las labores de retirada de lodos tuvo como consecuencia que en múltiples localizaciones se alterara de manera importante el perfil de los suelos, hasta el punto de que no era infrecuente que quedaran totalmente desmantelados los horizontes arcillosos y limosos del lecho del río hasta llegar a las capas de gravas. Esta circunstancia tuvo que ser tenida en cuenta a la hora de planificar las actuaciones de repoblación forestal.

Las principales actuaciones correctoras sobre los suelos se agruparon en tres bloques principales: 
 -  Tratamiento correctivo de la acidez: Una vez finalizadas las acciones de retiradas de lodos y con el fin de corregir la acidez de los suelos y de las aguas alteradas, dotándolas de la necesaria capacidad amortiguadora ante posibles episodios ácidos, se elaboró un proyecto de realización de enmiendas calizas. Se emplearon restos de espumas de azucareras (en dosis de 3 a 50 Tm/ha, según el estado de los suelos) que se generaban como consecuencia del proceso de fabricación de pasta de celulosas. Este fue un procedimiento de sumo interés, ya que por un lado se le daba uso a residuos agrícolas generados en la comarca, se compensaba el déficit de materia orgánica existente y, por supuesto, se corregían los importantes desequilibrios de pH ocasionados por el vertido. 
 -  Tratamiento correctivo de la componente orgánica: Los aportes de materia orgánica buscaban de manera principal el favorecer un ambiente reductor, con la consiguiente proliferación de bacterias reductoras de sulfato, de forma que se consiguiera el paso de sulfatos a sulfuros, altamente estables.
 -  Tratamiento sobre la componente inorgánica: Esta actuación se realizó mediante aportaciones de materiales ricos en carbonatos y óxidos de hierro amorfos con el objetivo principal de inmovilizar los restos de arsénico que en el medio pudieran quedar.

Con la finalización de las medidas de recuperación dentro del área afectada por el vertido minero, comenzaron los trabajos de restauración ecológica en el Guadiamar. Estos trabajos se proyectaron en dos grandes ámbitos de actuación, según las características de sus ecosistemas: las marismas del sector de Entremuros y los terrenos de riberas y de la llanura aluvial situados aguas arriba del anterior.  

Las obras de restauración en las marismas de Entremuros""”dentro del Espacio Natural Doñana""”se realizaron sobre una zona de casi 1.800 has que resultó afectada por la retención, durante varios meses, de las aguas ácidas provenientes del vertido. Las actuaciones desarrolladas en esta área (tras la depuración del agua contaminada y la regeneración de la vegetación de saladares) consistieron en la restauración de la funcionalidad geomorfológica, hidrológica y ecológica de este espacio, mediante la reconstrucción de los elementos hidro-geomorfológicos de la marisma (cauces, vetas, bancos laterales, etc.) que habían sido destruidos, primero, por las actividades agrícolas y, después, por las tareas de limpieza tras el vertido minero, así como la eliminación de los elementos artificiales (canales, muros y sistemas de drenaje) que desviaban el sistema de su funcionamiento natural. Entre las actuaciones más importantes están la recuperación de más de 15 km del antiguo cauce del Brazo de la Torre y del Caño Travieso, el relleno de canales de riego y de drenaje de antiguas tablas de arroz, la eliminación de sistemas de bombeo y obras de derivación de aguas para riego y la permeabilización de los dos vados que cruzan Entremuros. 

En cuanto a la restauración vegetal se descartó una posible replantación generalizada de las más de 1.600 ha de la zona, optándose por facilitar la recolonización natural de la vegetación marismeña. Para impulsar este proceso se llevaron a cabo plantaciones de pequeñas parcelas con plantas de saladares características de la zona para que funcionaran como áreas de dispersión. 

Las obras de restauración están permitiendo que las marismas de Entremuros recuperen la funcionalidad y la diversidad de hábitats que tenía en los años 50 del siglo pasado y que, pese al breve tiempo transcurrido, los ecosistemas restaurados estén experimentando un acelerado proceso de maduración.

Por otro lado, la restauración de los ecosistemas de la llanura aluvial del río Guadiamar""”desde Entremuros hasta la balsa minera""”que se vieron afectados por la deposición de lodos piríticos, con una superficie aproximada de unas 3.000 has, estuvo dirigida a la recuperación de la dinámica del sistema fluvial y a la restauración de los hábitats y paisajes naturales de ribera y de monte y matorral mediterráneo para convertirlo en un corredor ecológico. La adquisición de la totalidad de la superficie afectada por el vertido minero permitía llevar a cabo la restauración funcional del sistema fluvial en toda su integridad incluyendo la totalidad de los brazos de crecida que habían perdido su funcionalidad hidrológica por diversos motivos (roturaciones, muros de protección, extracciones de gravas, etc.) y toda la llanura de inundación, al no haber problemas de afectación a predios privados.

En lo que respecta al propio cauce, se consideró mucho más importante recuperar los procesos de la dinámica fluvial que intentar reconstruir su estructura morfológica. Por esta razón, se dejó libre de actuación el espacio limítrofe con el cauce o ""espacio de libertad"", donde el río pudiera reconstruir su perfil sin restricciones adquiriendo sus atributos característicos de sinuosidad y heterogeneidad y dejando también que fuera la propia vegetación espontánea la que cubriera sus márgenes. En todo momento se tuvo en cuenta la capacidad de autorrecuperación que poseen los sistemas naturales, en modo especial los presentes en ambientes mediterráneos. Se favoreció la restauración de los flujos, tanto en sentido longitudinal como lateral, eliminando las barreras que lo impedían o dificultaban. Se eliminaron estructuras transversales que interrumpían la continuidad del cauce, provocando la división del curso del río en diversos sectores estancos de encharcamiento artificial, alterando drásticamente el régimen del río e interrumpiendo el flujo de las especies acuáticas. 

Para la restauración del flujo en sentido longitudinal, se procedió a eliminar todas aquellas barreras (muros de defensa, roturaciones de antiguos brazos de crecida, extracciones de gravas, etc.) que interrumpían la continuidad de los cauces de funcionamiento temporal, conocidos localmente como ""madres viejas"".

Aparte de las barreras físicas, se consideraron también las barreras químicas, producidas por los vertidos contaminantes, que dificultan la colonización y el desplazamiento de las comunidades acuáticas (aguas residuales urbanas, vertidos de la industria de aderezo de la aceituna de mesa). En este aspecto se puso especial atención en el control y denuncia de los episodios de contaminación ligados a la industria aceitunera que dificultan el proceso de recuperación de las comunidades acuáticas.

En relación con la vegetación, se consideró conveniente proceder al recubrimiento de los suelos con la plantación de especies autóctonas por varias causas: las labores de limpieza habían dejado los suelos prácticamente desnudos y en ausencia de un banco de semillas, lo que acrecentaba los posibles riesgos de erosión. Por otra parte, la permanencia de la zona expropiada como terreno calmo podría infundir en la población la idea de falta de actuación de la administración o de proyecto inacabado. Y, por último, la repoblación contribuiría a incrementar la calidad ambiental de la zona afectada y dotarla de un mayor grado de protección, al pasar a tener la consideración de terrenos forestales, además de favorecer su función como corredor ecológico, al dotar de refugio a la fauna terrestre. 

La restauración vegetal se ha desarrollado con diversas tareas y fases, entre las que destacan la preparación de los suelos, los aportes de materia orgánica y la plantación de los antiguos terrenos agrícolas. La reforestación se llevó a cabo según distintos modelos de plantación, de acuerdo con las condiciones naturales propias de cada zona, no siendo concebida como meta en sí misma, sino más bien como el inicio de un proceso de recolonización y desarrollo de las comunidades vegetales naturales, destinado además a frenar los fenómenos erosivos presentes en la zona.

Todas las plantas utilizadas fueron especies autóctonas, desde las propias de ribera (álamo, fresno, sauce, almez, etc.) hasta las características del bosque mediterráneo (encina, alcornoque, acebuche, algarrobo, así como numerosas especies arbustivas). Además, se han reutilizado plantas de gran porte transportadas, con la técnica del escayolado, desde lugares en los que se realizaban diversas obras de infraestructuras. Así, por ejemplo, han sido numerosas las encinas procedentes de las obras de excavación del vaso de la presa del Andévalo en Huelva, alcornoques de la autovía Jerez-Los Barrios y también ejemplares procedentes de entresacas en diversos montes públicos como acebuches de la finca La Alcaidesa (San Roque) y alcornoques de Madroñalejos (Aznalcóllar). La densidad de plantación osciló entre 700 y 900 plantas por hectárea, siendo distribuidas de manera no lineal para conseguir una mayor sensación de naturalidad.

Aparte de la forestación, se realizaron otras intervenciones destinadas a facilitar la reforestación autóctona, como la eliminación de vegetación exótica (casuarinas, acacias y sobre todo eucaliptos) que cubrían amplios sectores de las riberas del tramo norte. Buena parte de los restos vegetales extraídos se emplearon para la construcción de obras menores como escolleras, diques o refugios para liebres y conejos. 

En cuanto a la restauración de las riberas inmediatas al cauce se optó por la no intervención en la mayoría de las situaciones, bajo la filosofía de la restauración pasiva. De este modo se favoreció el desarrollo espontáneo de la vegetación riparia. En algunas localizaciones, en cambio, sí fue plantada, siguiendo las recomendaciones de la bibliografía especializada.

Para la realización de los trabajos de restauración y adecuación para el uso público del Corredor Verde del Guadiamar ha sido necesario, como paso previo, la delimitación precisa de los terrenos que lo integran y la instalación de un cerramiento perimetral de separación de los terrenos agrícolas privados.
 
El cerramiento se hacía necesario también para proteger las nuevas plantaciones de la posible entrada de ganado desde las explotaciones limítrofes, así como para evitar aprovechamientos no permitidos, como la siembra, el furtivismo o la recogida de productos de la zona afectada por el vertido.

Para el cerramiento se optó por un tipo de vallado que, además de efectivo, resultara permeable para la fauna silvestre. Se trata de una malla de seis hiladas de alambre, dos de doble hilo de espino y las otras cuatro de alambre galvanizado, que se apoyan en postes de madera tratada separados cada cuatro metros. El vallado perimetral suma una longitud de 118 km.
 
Dentro de estos trabajos de cerramiento, con el fin de impedir el acceso de vehículos no autorizados que puedan interferir a los usuarios a pie, en bicicleta o a caballo por el interior del Corredor Verde del Guadiamar, se ha procedido a la instalación de barreras en todos los accesos al mismo desde carreteras y caminos. Se trata de unas barreras permeables que sólo impiden el paso a los vehículos motorizados, permitiendo el acceso por los medios antes citados. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: El efecto ambiental de los residuos mineros en las aguas todavía es observable en la zona, desde la mina hasta el puente de las Doblas, en el municipio de Sanlúcar la Mayor, aunque en modo muy atenuado. Desde esta localización hacia el sur, el pH se encuentra cerca de la neutralidad, mientras que la concentración de elementos traza disminuye de manera ostensible. De hecho, a partir del año 2002 las tendencias de pH convergen en todas las estaciones de seguimiento, ajustándose a un rango de variabilidad próximo a la normalidad, establecido por consenso entre 6 y 9. 

Con respecto a otros indicadores de calidad de las aguas como el oxígeno disuelto, las concentraciones encontradas, sobre todo a partir del año 2000, se corresponden con aguas adecuadamente oxigenadas (por encima de los 4 mg/l) para tramos medios y bajos de ríos. El comportamiento de las medidas de oxígeno disuelto comienzan a converger a partir del otoño de ese año, de forma que a partir de esta fecha los patrones encontrados de descensos en momentos de estío y aumentos en momentos invernales, tras lluvias, se repiten para todas las estaciones con algunas excepciones (en el Vado del Quema y localizaciones próximas a la marisma). 

Con respecto a la evolución seguida por los elementos traza como metales pesados o arsénico, puede servir de ilustrativo ejemplo el caso del As o del Zn, elementos químicos de referencia en seguimientos de calidad ambiental de zonas afectadas por la minería. Durante el mes de abril de 1998 (justo después del vertido) se alcanzaron altas concentraciones de arsénico en agua en varias localizaciones; sin embargo unos años después (2002), se superaron los orientadores de calidad solo de manera puntual en aquellos lugares cercanos a la mina y la balsa sellada. Aparte de estos sucesos concretos, las concentraciones encontradas en las aguas del río han sido en estos años, en general, muy bajas. 

Al igual que con el arsénico, se alcanzaron altos niveles de Zn (más de 350 mg/l). Sin embargo, en el mismo año no se superaron los 2 mg/l (valor de referencia) en ninguno de los muestreos realizados; mientras que en las estaciones más alejadas a la balsa de Aznalcóllar los valores registrados fueron en todo momento muy inferiores.

No sólo los indicadores físicos y químicos de calidad de aguas, sino también los biológicos han puesto de manifiesto el claro proceso de recuperación ambiental que se ha dado en esta década. Los estudios efectuados sobre las poblaciones de diatomeas bentónicas, algas que viven adheridas a las rocas y fondo del lecho del río, o de las comunidades de macroinvertebrados acuáticos ""” como las libélulas ""” ponen claramente de manifiesto una diferenciación de los tramos de la Cuenca situados aguas arriba de la influencia de la mina con respecto a los demás. Si bien los últimos estudios reflejan una mejoría de las aguas, con los exigentes criterios de calidad del agua establecidos por la Directiva Marco del Agua (DMA) sería preciso la implementación de medidas correctoras al objeto de alcanzar los objetivos marcados para el año 2015 en buena parte de las aguas del cauce, al igual que en la mayoría de los ríos y arroyos andaluces.

Con respecto a la evolución seguida en el río por especies de vertebrados acuáticos, son claros bioindicadores de calidad ambiental de estos ambientes los anfibios. Si bien la única especie de este grupo zoológico presente en la zona en los años siguientes al vertido fue la rana común (Pelophylax perezi), en los últimos muestreos exhaustivos llevados a cabo en mayo del año 2006 se encuentran larvas de siete especies: Bufo bufo, Discoglossus galganoi, Pelobates cultripes, Pelodytes ibericus, Pleurodeles waltl, Hyla meridionalis y Rana perezi. Actualmente, y debido a la escasez de hábitats reproductivos adecuados, el espacio protegido posee una menor diversidad de especies de estos vertebrados que la esperable, por lo que la restauración debería continuarse mediante la implementación de sencillas pero eficaces medidas como la creación de charcas temporales. 

Con respecto a las poblaciones de peces, actualmente el río Guadiamar consta con un total de 19 especies, de las que 13 son nativas. Dos de ellas ""” carpín (Carassius gibelio) y gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) ""” no habían sido documentadas anteriormente. El barbo (Barbus sclateri) es la dominante del area fluvial afectada. En la marisma lo son la carpa (Cyprinus carpio) y la gambusia. 

El proceso de colonización del río por parte de este grupo zoológico ha sido adecuado, como reflejo de una paulatina mejoría de la calidad del agua del Guadiamar. Partiendo de una situación de cero que supuso la práctica desaparición de todas las comunidades acuáticas en los primeros días, a los cinco años comenzaron a reproducirse de forma natural las primeras especies piscícolas; en siete años ya estaban presentes todas las especies que existían antes del vertido y a los nueve años la recuperación había sido tal que permitió la reanudación de la pesca deportiva en el río. 

En el momento presente todo apunta a que el proceso de colonización por las especies piscícolas está estabilizado, aunque también parece claro que la zona no afectada presenta índices de biodiversidad más altos, lo que parece indicar que el proceso de colonización no ha terminado. Además, la presencia de las primeras fases larvarias de estos animales indica que sus ciclos vitales se completan, indicio claro de la recuperación ambiental del área. Dicha recuperación debería seguir avanzando con el paso del tiempo conforme las fuentes difusas de contaminación sean controladas y las estructuras transversals que siguen alterando puntualmente la continuidad física del río, afectando a su dinámica natural, sean desmanteladas.

El desarrollo vegetal que se está produciendo en una parte significativa del Paisaje Protegido parece reflejar la idoneidad de muchas de las medidas acometidas para paliar los efectos ambientales del vertido de lodos. Sin embargo, la porción norte del espacio (con suelos más castigados de manera secular) denota un grado de recuperación más lento en cuanto al crecimiento de la vegetación se refiere, situación que se irá corrigiendo con el tiempo. 

La situación es bien diferente en el tramo centro. Esta zona, con un río más maduro desde el punto de vista geomorfológico y una llanura aluvial con suelos ricos en materia orgánica y humedad, muestra una vegetación que comienza a adquirir un porte adecuado en el 54.9% del tramo; más de 25 hectáreas presentan una cobertura considerada como de ""muy buena"". Es importante destacar que es notable el desarrollo del bosque de ribera en no pocas localizaciones, sobre todo al sur del municipio de Aznalcázar. Sin embargo, esta zona presenta el problema del enorme desarrollo de la vegetación herbácea en primavera (principalmente ruderal) que, aprovechando la adecuada mineralización de los suelos y la humedad presente por la cercanía del cauce y del nivel freático, llega a dificultar el desarrollo de los plantones de matorral y arbolado de forestación.

El último tramo se corresponde con una unidad geoambiental bien diferente, la del dominio de la pre-marisma, antesala de los ambientes marismeños que definen en buena medida al Espacio Natural Doñana. Aquí el 90.2% de la zona presenta una cobertura media o buena y los ejemplos de bosque de ribera presentan un estado óptimo de desarrollo, con series catenales bien estructuradas que dan abrigo a numerosas especies de invertebrados y aves.

En paralelo con la recuperación vegetal, se han producido importantes avances en cuanto a la recolonización del espacio por las comunidades faunísticas. 

En los estudios sobre poblaciones de nematodos, se han detectado en el Guadiamar 103 especies. No sólo se han identificado especies cosmopolitas, sino que se han encontrado algunas de carácter exclusivo en toda la región, lo que refuerza el interés de la zona desde el punto de vista de la conservación ambiental. Si bien en los primeros años se observó un gradiente norte-sur creciente de diversidad, éste se ha ido atenuando progresivamente al mismo tiempo que se ha producido la recuperación ambiental del territorio. Actualmente, los niveles de diversidad en la nematofauna del área afectada son equivalentes a los encontrados en áreas limítrofes de cultivos, aunque inferiores a los esperables para áreas forestales bien conservadas, lo que también refleja con claridad que el proceso de recuperación ambiental aún no ha concluido.

Las especies de avifauna han recolonizado el territorio de manera notable. En fechas recientes, los censos arrojan la cifra de 144 especies de aves observadas en el Corredor Verde del Guadiamar, algunas de ellas en serio peligro de extinción como la cigÁ¼eña negra (Ciconia nigra). Si bien en un principio se alcanzaron altos valores de riqueza y diversidad, con el paso del tiempo estos índices se han ido estabilizando. De hecho, en el momento presente sólo la abundancia sigue aumentando, favorecida por la proximidad de Doñana y el restablecimiento gradual de la vegetación arbustiva y arbórea. Al mismo tiempo, la restauración de numerosas graveras abandonadas en lagunas artificiales con agua de calidad y abundante vegetación palustre ha propiciado la llegada de numerosas de especies de aves acuáticas, entre las que destacan las garzas.

En cuanto a la recolonización por mamíferos, parece claro que los fragmentos que aún quedan de foresta en el agrosistema del Guadiamar cumplen un destacado papel en la recolonización del Paisaje Protegido, posibilitando su papel como elemento conector entre Doñana y Sierra Morena. La recolonización del corredor ecológico por especies de elevada movilidad como los mamíferos carnívoros se está produciendo fundamentalmente desde el sur, donde la estructura del paisaje es más compleja. El tejón (Meles meles), la gineta (Genetta genetta) y el meloncillo (Herpestes ichneumon) ocupan la mitad meridional del espacio protegido, adyacente al Parque Natural de Doñana, pero no la mitad septentrional próxima a Sierra Morena. Esta distribución asimétrica se relaciona con un mayor grado de forestación de las riberas, una mayor superficie de áreas forestadas próximas en posición lateral, y una mayor diversidad y complejidad estructural del paisaje en las inmediaciones de la sección meridional con respecto a la sección norte. Otras especies de mamíferos como el zorro (Vulpes vulpes), la liebre (Lepus granatensis) o el conejo (Oryctolagus cuniculus) están bien representadas en buena parte del territorio.

Tras la realización de las actuaciones de restauración, el río Guadiamar ha empezado a recuperar su dinámica natural, volviendo a funcionar muchos de los antiguos brazos de crecida que habían sido obstruidos o transformados por las actividades agrícolas. Por ende, cuando se producen fenómenos de desbordamientos, las crecidas se manifiestan con entera libertad en toda la amplitud de la llanura de inundación, como corresponde a un sistema hidrológico natural. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: El tramo norte del corredor verde se caracteriza por poseer un escaso desarrollo de su vegetación, en parte por haber sido la zona más afectada por el vertido minero y en parte por poseer unos suelos menos desarrollados con un fondo natural de elementos traza consecuencia de la minería histórica y de la propia naturaleza del sustrato edáfico y la roca madre. El 61.9% del territorio se corresponde con la categoría de ""sin cobertura o con baja cobertura"" y tan sólo el 21.2% con cobertura media o buena así como con bosques riparios. Este tramo también se caracteriza por presentar un río con geomorfología poco madura, consecuencia indirecta de las labores de limpieza y remediación posteriores al accidente ambiental. Estas circunstancias se reflejan en un bosque ripario escasamente desarrollado.

El desarrollo de la vegetación en los otros tramos ha sido adecuado, a pesar de que el último muestreo de suelos realizado en la zona del corredor verde demuestra que éstos están aún influidos en cierto grado por el vertido tóxico. Se encontraron concentraciones totales de elementos traza que indican la existencia de contaminación residual (en buena medida ya presente antes del vertido minero), a pesar de la remoción de los lodos y las labores de recuperación llevadas a cabo mediante la aplicación de enmiendas de distinto tipo a los que fueron sometidos. Los valores más altos de As y Pb, elementos menos móviles, se han registrado en las localizaciones más próximas a la balsa, primeros 13 km, tramo que resultó más contaminado por el accidente. En cualquier caso, es importante reseñar que estos niveles residuales de contaminación se encuentran en fracciones escasamente biodisponibles, por lo que la posible incidencia sobre los sistemas naturales es, hoy, poco preocupante por la dificultad de que difundan por las redes tróficas. 

Los estudios que determinan las relaciones entre planta y suelo han puesto de manifiesto que la acumulación de elementos traza en plantas superiores puede ser muy distinta en función del elemento en cuestión, especie y órgano vegetal del que se trate. La mayoría de árboles y arbustos empleados en las reforestaciones apenas acumulan elementos traza en sus hojas. Sólo los árboles adultos y plantones de álamo blanco (Populus alba) y sauce (Salíx sp.) acumulan cantidades importantes de Cd y Zn. Algunas crucíferas acumulan talio en sus estructuras reproductoras muy por encima de los niveles normales en plantas superiores, aunque la magnitud de este proceso está muy condicionada por la humedad del suelo. Otras herbáceas frecuentes de la zona también pueden acumular distintos elementos traza en órganos aéreos; algunas Plantagináceas, por ejemplo, pueden acumular cantidades comparativamente altas de As, Pb, e incluso Tl, en sus hojas y espigas florales. En general, la aplicación de enmiendas orgánicas (realizada a lo largo del proceso de limpieza y recuperación de suelos) tuvo un efecto positivo, limitando la acumulación de estos elementos en las plantas herbáceas.

Uno de los aspectos de mayor trascendencia del proyecto de restauración del río Guadiamar y su llanura aluvial ha sido el relacionado con los procesos de recolonización de las comunidades faunísticas. Pese al poco tiempo transcurrido, una década, se manifiestan importantes signos de recuperación, aunque con grandes variaciones entre los diferentes grupos, dependiendo del nivel de requerimientos ecológicos y de su capacidad de dispersión.

Entre los vertebrados, la suerte que han sufrido las diferentes especies ha sido desigual. Mientras que las especies reptiles ligadas al medio acuático, como el galápago leproso (Mauremys leprosa) y la culebra viperina (Natrix maura), han presentado un ritmo de recolonización mucho más rápido, con importantes poblaciones a lo largo de todo el río, los reptiles terrestres están recolonizando el territorio mucho más lentamente. De hecho sólo se han citado seis de las trece especies potenciales que correspondería estuvieran presentes en la región: un gekónido (Tarentola mauritanica), dos lacértidos (Psammodromus algirus, Timon lepidus) y tres colúbridos (Malpolon monspessulanus, Hemorrhois hippocrepis, Natrix maura). Ello se explica, entre otras causas, por su menor capacidad de dispersión y por el efecto negativo y perturbador que han tenido las intensas labores de retirada de lodos y las labores realizadas posteriormente de desbroces y enmiendas de suelos. Suelen ser especies muy sensibles a la existencia de refugios y la ausencia de éstos ha convertido esta zona en un hábitat poco propicio para su asentamiento y posterior dispersión. Para compensar la falta de estos refugios naturales se han construido a lo largo del Corredor Verde del Guadiamar una serie de refugios artificiales aprovechando los troncos de los eucaliptos eliminados.
Diez años después del accidente minero, la restauración ambiental en el Guadiamar es un proceso vivo. Se puede constatar como después de las intensas labores de forestación con especies autóctonas son ya claros los indicios de recuperación vegetal (tanto de ribera como de bosque y matorral mediterráneo). Esta vegetación es expresión clara de la emergencia de unos paisajes que, en buena medida, ya estaban olvidados en esta zona de la cuenca del río Guadiamar tras décadas de profunda alteración antrópica en un territorio marcado por la minería y la agricultura.
Puede afirmarse, en suma y sin riesgos a equivocarse, que la velocidad a la que se están dando muchos de los procesos de restauración han desmentido buena parte de los negros presagios que pocos días y meses después de uno de los mayores accidentes medioambientales de España se dieron. La celeridad y contundencia de las medidas adoptadas, muchas arriesgadas, pusieron a prueba a la administración ambiental de la región y la capacidad humana para superar una crisis de esta gravedad. En este aspecto, el principal legado positivo del vertido minero de Aznalcóllar ha sido el convertir la respuesta dada por las administraciones en una referencia obligada a nivel internacional como modelo de intervención para superar catastrophes ambientales de gran calado ambiental y socioeconómico. Esta es una conclusión que se desprende de la mayoría de organismos internacionales que han analizado en detalle este caso.
Particularmente interesante fue la evaluación a posteriori de los resultados del proyecto que realizó el Banco de Desarrollo del Consejo de Europa en 2003 desde su condición de organismo que prestó ayuda financiera a la Junta de Andalucía para las operaciones de limpieza. En su informe se establecía como conclusión principal que la actuación pública emprendida para superar esta catástrofe debía considerarse como referente para la corrección de otros desastres de naturaleza similar y se destacaban los siguientes puntos fuertes:
–Para la superación de catástrofes de este tipo, la respuesta a tiempo es un factor clave y determinante en los resultados finales. A pesar de los agravantes que suponían la necesidad de hacer frente a una situación de extrema gravedad y de gran complejidad, sin disponer de antecedentes, se considera acertado que se reaccionara con rapidez tomando entre otras medidas la retirada inmediata de los lodos depositados, lo que ha significado una medida crucial para la recuperación posterior de la zona.
–El diseño de los planes de actuación frente a catástrofes de este tipo debe ser sencillo y participativo, con la implicación de los principales agentes sociales, considerándose muy positiva la implicación de la comunidad científica para superar las posibles incertidumbres y elegir las medidas más adecuadas.
–Es muy importante tener bien definidos unos protocolos de actuación para actuar adecuadamente frente a desastres ambientales. Aunque no se habían establecido de forma previa protocolos de intervención, se valora muy positivamente la capacidad organizativa y de coordinación de las administraciones actuantes para controlar la situación. Dentro de estas medidas destaca la creación sólo cinco días más tarde, de una Comisión Mixta de Coordinación al más alto nivel entre la Administración General del Estado y la Junta de Andalucía, en la que quedaron claramente establecidos los órganos que debían intervenir y sus respectivas funciones
–Se considera muy positivo aprovechar el contexto de oportunidad que generan estas situaciones para realizar proyectos de mayor alcance o con objetivos a más largo plazo. Entre otras cosas, se considera que la expropiación ha constituido una medida muy importante para poder llevar a cabo los trabajos de descontaminación y de restauración posterior de los terrenos. Hay que tener en cuenta que en una situación social tan grave como la que se creó tras el vertido si las administraciones hubieran decidido no intervenir hasta que no se determinara judicialmente las responsabilidades por los hechos ocurridos, además de unas consecuencias muchísimo más graves para el medio ambiente, se habría creado un clima socialmente insostenible para los propietarios afectados y un enorme daño para la agricultura de las comarcas más próximas al Guadiamar. En abril de 2003, el Consejo de Gobierno de la Junta de Andalucía adoptó el acuerdo de integrar el Corredor Verde del Guadiamar en la Red de Espacios Naturales Protegidos de Andalucía (RENPA) bajo la figura de Paisaje Protegido, representando el primer espacio al que se aplica esta figura de protección en Andalucía.
La declaración de los terrenos que conforman el corredor como espacio protegido no ha sido fruto de la casualidad, sino que es resultado de un proceso de reflexión que hunde sus raíces en el momento en que el Consejo de Gobierno de la Junta de Andalucía adoptó la decisión de expropiar los terrenos afectados por el vertido minero de Aznalcóllar para convertirlos en un corredor ecológico libre de usos agrícolas. Durante el período de ejecución de las obras de descontaminación y restauración ambiental se estuvo debatiendo la oportunidad y conveniencia de dotar a estos terrenos de alguna figura de protección específica.
Una vez que los principales parámetros de medición de la calidad ambiental mostraban una clara tendencia a la normalización, tras cinco años de intensos trabajos de restauración, el Consejo de Go-bierno de la Junta de Andalucía tomó la decisión de declararlo Paisaje Protegido mediante el Decreto 112/2003 de 22 de abril, siendo la primera vez que se aplicaba esta figura de protección en Andalucía. La zona incluida en el Paisaje Protegido ocupa una superficie de 2.706,8 ha que corresponden a la totalidad de la superficie expropiada excluyendo del mismo a Entremuros, al estar ya incluido en el Espacio Natural Doñana.
La declaración del Corredor Verde del Guadiamar como Paisaje Protegido respondía al objetivo de favorecer la protección a largo plazo de este territorio con la garantía jurídica que suponía el dotarlo de un régimen especial de protección y de una normativa que permitiera establecer las pautas de funcionamiento adecuadas con las funciones que se pretendían para este espacio de conservación, de Uso Público y desarrollo sostenible. Es decir, no bastaba con que la titularidad de los terrenos fuese pública, sino que se pretendía otorgarles un marco jurídico que asegurase a largo plazo el cumplimiento de los objetivos de conservación y uso sostenible para los que fueron expropiados bajo el estatus especial que suponía su declaración como espacio protegido.
Las siguientes finalidades, establecidas en el Decreto 112/2003 de 22 de abril, se pretendían con la declaración del Corredor Verde del Guadiamar como espacio protegido:
— Establecer los mecanismos oportunos para llevar a cabo una gestión y ordenación del espacio que contribuya a la mejora de la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos.
— Garantizar la calidad de las aguas que abastecen los espacios protegidos de Doñana y el estuario del Guadalquivir.
— Llevar a cabo la dotación de equipamientos e infraestructuras que contribuyan al uso público y al disfrute del paisaje, potenciándose programas de educación ambiental y otras actuaciones participativas y de implicación de los ciudadanos.
— Conservar, ordenar y gestionar los sistemas naturales existentes en su ámbito territorial y colaborar en programas internacionales de conservación.
— La sensibilización de la sociedad respecto a los valores naturales, faunísticos, botánicos, paisajísticos, y culturales presentes, articulando para ello los mecanismos de difusión necesarios.
— Promover la investigación científica cuyo objeto sea el conocimiento de aspectos relacionados con la regeneración, conservación, ordenación y gestión de este espacio natural.
— Propiciar conexiones funcionales con los espacios naturales del entorno, en particular con la comarca de Doñana y Sierra Morena, facilitando el desplazamiento de la fauna silvestre.
— Continuar el seguimiento de los indicadores ambientales establecidos para conocer la evolución y el proceso de recuperación de sus ecosistemas. "

The project also provides employment and training to local people from poor communities, while ensuring that the benefits of their work are experienced by a broad range of people. People were hired to remove alien plants, plant indigenous gardens, stabilize sand dunes and build pathways. The hope is that in the longer-term, this project will lead to improved integrity of and low-impact public access to coastal areas of interest, improved capacity and employability of people from local poor communities, and improved inter-cultural communication in the coastal area. Combining restoration with job creation is an important way to increase public appreciation for conservation.Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry 
The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The project is conducted by the Kommetjie Environmental Awareness Group (KEAG), a non-profit organization. Also affected or involved are the Kommetjie Residents and Ratepayers Association, the City of Cape Town, and residents of the poorer communities Masiphumelele and Ocean View. The City has power. Decisions have been made within KEAG.

Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: In progress (early stages). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Sharing of wealth would assist in speedier recovery through the hiring of more people and the acquisition of more indigenous plants. Concerted resources to remove the rubbish at the old dump would also help.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: 8 people have been hired during the course of this project. Environmental education and life-skills training (e.g. career planning, business presentation) have also been provided.
Aliens are being removed from the root using a tree popper, which will prevent regrowth without the use of herbicide. Hardy indigenous plants have been chosen that can survive without maintenance. Local residents are informed about the project. Signs are being put up to explain the ecosystems and restoration projects. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/mauritius-forest-habitat-restoration-in-the-ile-aux-aigrettes-nature-reserve/	Mauritius: Forest Habitat Restoration in the Ile Aux Aigrettes Nature Reserve	Mauritius	1984-03-26	2009-03-26	"Managed and leased by the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation (MWF), Ile aux Aigrettes is a 25-hectare island just off the southeast coast of mainland Mauritius that contains the last remnant of Mauritian coastal ebony forest. Exotic plant and animal species had driven the ecosystem to the brink of extinction by the 1980s, and it was then that MWF began its ongoing restoration program. Initial interventions included the removal of non-native plant species, revegetation with nursery-reared seedlings, and the eradication of rats, cats and mongooses. Several endemic and critically endangered species were subsequently reintroduced to the island, and diligent monitoring has reflected steadily increasing populations. Monitoring and control of non-native plants is ongoing, and studies are currently underway to determine the most effective methods for eradicating the Indian house shrew, Indian wolf snake and giant African land snail, three species that have thus far eluded management attempts.Deforestation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) Degradation of the islet began with the arrival of Europeans in the seventeenth century and has been driven by two primary causes: deforestation to meet the demand for its valuable hardwoods and enable the cultivation of sugar cane, and the introduction of a large number of exotic plant and animal species. By the time restoration activities began in 1984, the island had become a threatened ecosystem, and native species were under intense pressure from non-native competitors.
There are 97 known introduced plant species on the island, 28 of which are considered major weeds, including: false acacia (Leucaena leucocephala), prune malgache (Flacourtia indica) and tecoma (Tabebuia pallida). Others such as Asparagus setaceous and Kalanchoe pinnata are not currently present at high densities but represent a potential threat.
Rats, cats, mongooses, goats and chickens were previously present on the island, and although they have been successfully eradicated (mostly through trapping), there are still a number of alien animal species present. These include: shrews, Giant African landsnails (Acatina spp.), the Indian wolfsnake (Lycodon aulicus) and the agamid lizard (Calotes versicolor). Several species of house geckos are also present on the island. These species impact native species in several ways: they affect native invertebrate and reptile species both as competitors and predators; they feed on native seedlings and fruit, inhibiting natural succession; and they eat birds’ eggs, posing a threat to important avifauna species. MWF’s objective is to restore Ile aux Aigrettes to a condition much as it was before the arrival of Europeans in Mauritius, with all the flora and fauna necessary for it to be a self-sustaining indigenous ecosystem. This includes conserving and re-establishing native plant and animal species by first removing exotic invasive species and then reintroducing native vegetation and endemic birds and reptiles.
A secondary objective is to develop a model for ecological restoration that can be applied to other sites.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The key stakeholders in the project are: a) the national government (in the body of the National Parks and Conservation Service), which has the national responsibility of ensuring that Mauritius’s native and endemic species and habitats are conserved under the NEAP, b) the project executing agency, the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation c) the national and local communities, and the tourism operators who will all gain economically from any increased volume of ecotourists, d) Global Environment Facility (GEF), the World Bank and other co-financing organisations, and e) The national and international tourists who visit Ile aux Aigrettes.
Throughout its 16-year existence, MWF has collaborated closely with the Government of Mauritius National Parks and Conservation Service. MWF’s links with the national media, its newsletter and its Wildlife Supporters Club have provided regular information about all of MWFs projects to the national public and conservation enthusiasts. More recently, MWF has been involved in public education through the activities of MWF’s Community Conservation Educator for nearby Rodrigues Island, and the ecotourism project in Mauritius. The Rodrigues community education project and Ile aux Aigrettes tourism projects have integrated public consultation and involvement in awareness-raising and planning. MWF’s forest restoration projects in Mauritius and Rodrigues have made opportunities available for community participation.

Description of Project Activities: Upon assuming responsibility for the management of Ile aux Aigrettes, one of the first steps taken by the MWF was to contract a resident watchman in order to stop illegal entry into the island reserve and protect the forest from massive firewood harvesting.

Invasive plant eradication programmes on Ile aux Aigrettes began in 1985 and have been carried out by off-season sugar cane workers, contract labourers and a handful of volunteers, with the main target species being Leucaena leucocephala, Flacourtia indica and Tabebuia pallida. Weeding is done mechanically by uprooting (pulling by hand or removing mechanically for larger plants) and, where this is not possible, by simply cutting the tree stems and brushing a ten percent solution of herbicide (usually Tordon 101 (picloram) or Roundup (glyphosate)) on the cut stem. Labour costs for initial weeding have been estimated at approximately US$3,000 per hectare.

Once these areas are cleared of invasive plants, it is necessary to replant immediately with native species in order to slow down secondary invasions and regrowth of non-natives from the seed bank. The island is divided into 12.5 x 12.5m grids for management purposes, and each grid is surveyed and given a planting prescription ranging from no planting to full planting. Seedlings are replanted at a density of up to four plants per square metre, and the main species planted include: Dodonaea viscosa, Gastonia mauritiana, Pandanus vandermeeschii, Tarenna borbonica and Dracaena concinna. Seedlings are produced in a nursery established on the island in 1997 from seeds collected on Ile aux Aigrettes and from some well defined areas on the mainland (although where possible, efforts are made not to mix mainland populations, as they may have separate genotypes). Planting occurs during the rainy season (February to April) in square plugs 4 - 5 cm deep, and the seedlings are usually about 20 cm high when planted.

After initial weeding and replanting, regrowth and reinvasion of exotic species must be regularly monitored and controlled. Continuity is absolutely crucial to deplete the soil seed bank and to assure successful re-establishment of native vegetation. On Ile aux Aigrettes, the first maintenance weeding of the newly planted areas is carried out between one and six months after the initial weeding and replanting, with a second several months later (depending on the state of weed regrowth). All species except grasses are removed by hand. Weeding is subsequently carried out once a year with an estimated long-term cost of approximately US$140 per hectare per year (Mauremootoo and Towner-Mauremootoo in press). Although it is expected that once the native canopy is restored, regrowth of exotic species will sharply decline, low-intensity weeding will almost certainly have to be continued indefinitely. 

In 1991 rats, cats and mongooses previously present on the island were successfully eradicated. Based on advice from experts in New Zealand, anti-coagulant poisons were used to kill rats without affecting native species. Cats and mongooses were removed by trapping. No efforts have yet been made to eradicate the Giant African landsnails (Acatina spp.) or the Indian wolfsnake (Lycodon aulicus), although the populations have been surveyed. 

Once these predatory species had been eradicated from the island, the process of restoring native fauna began. Over 30 Mauritius Kestrels (Falco punctatus), formerly regarded as the world's rarest bird, were reintroduced between 1990 and 1994. In 1994, an aviary was set up on the island, and 35 Pink Pigeons were reintroduced. The critically endangered Mauritius Fody (Foudia rubra) was reintroduced in November 2003 and is now successfully breeding. Finally, in December 2006, 4 Olive White-eyes (Zosterops chloronothos) and 39 Telfair's skinks (Leiolopisma telairii), a native repile once widespread throughout Mauritius, were reintroduced to celebrate 20 years of conservation work on Ile aux Aigrettes.

Mauritius once had two endemic giant tortoise species (Geochelone inepta and Geochelone triserrata), but these became extinct about 200 years ago as a result of excessive exploitation by man and predation by introduced animals. In 2000, 18 adult and sub-adult Giant Aldabran Tortoises (Geochelone gigantean) were released on Ile aux Aigrettes to simulate the impact of browsers on the island's vegetation and help control the regeneration of exotic species. The release of G. gigantea on a larger scale will only be carried out after it has been proven that native species do not suffer from grazing. Moreover, before the giant tortoises could be released island-wide, herbivore-dispersed weeds such as Leucaena leucocephala would have to be eradicated. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: At the time of writing, nearly 90% of the island (all but 5 ha) had been weeded at least once and replanted with native plants. Some 30 endangered endemic/native plant species had been reintroduced to the island, including the critically endangered Round Island Bottle Palm and the Round Island Hurricane Palm, of which only one adult tree remains in the wild. Intense weeding efforts will be maintained until 2010 and will gradually be reduced as the forest canopy is restored. Under a good canopy, an area will require weeding about once every five years.

The reintroduction of native fauna has been largely successful and has contributed significantly to stabilizing waning populations of important and critically endangered species. The island's population of Pink Pigeons has grown from 35 to approximately 70 and currently represents 20% of the world's remaining population, being 1 of only 5 sub-populations of this vulnerable species. The number of Fodies on Ile aux Aigrettes has increased every year since their release, and in December 2008, there were 152 individuals counted, the largest number on record. In fact, the Fodies have done so well that they will be used as the source population for a new sub-population to be reintroduced on Round Island (north of Mauritius) in 2009. The 4 Olive White-eyes released in 2006 have grown to 6 nesting pairs, and in December 2008, 35 nesting attempts were recorded, of which 13 produced eggs. 

The Mauritius Kestrel, reintroduced on Ile aux Aigrettes in the early 1990s, now visits the island only on rare occasions, preferring instead the nearby Bambous Mountains on the mainland. In spite of the fact that a population has not become established on Ile aux Aigrettes, Mauritius Kestrels now number between 800 and 1000 and are considered one of the MWF's greatest success stories after standing on the brink of extinction with only 4 individuals left in the wild in 1974.

The release of reptiles on Ile aux Aigrettes has also been successful. The Aldabran tortoises show a grazing preference for exotic plant species and are thus helping to control weeds. The Telfair's skink, reintroduced in 2006, is also aiding in the restoration of the island, as it is reducing the number of problematic introduced animals that can't be removed by the MWF (e.g. Indian House shrew, Indian wolf snake) and dispersing the seeds of such endemic plants as Ebony. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: In spite of the efforts made by the MWF, there are still a number of introduced or alien animal species present on the island. This includes the Indian House shrew (Suncus murinus), Indian wolfsnake (Lycodon aulicum), and Giant African land snail (Achatina fulica), all of which affect native biodiversity as competitors and predators. In 1999, an attempt to eradicate the House Shrew proved unsuccessful, as managers of the island have yet to find a completely effective bait that attracts House Shrews to live traps or for poisoning. Furthermore, poisoning has proven problematic because an effective poison has not been found yet either. Managers are currently investigating new baits, possibly using micro-encapsulated shrew scent, and considering the use of dogs that can find ""˜trap-shy' individuals. Once shrews have been successfully eradicated, a number of indigenous reptile species will be reintroduced.

Other problematic species include the agamid lizard (Calotes versicolor) and house geckos. Researchers on the island feel that, given current technology, there is little hope of eradicating either of these two species. Nic Cole, the project's herpetologist, is currently investigating the interactions between the native and introduced geckos on the island. Fortunately, he has found that there are relatively more native geckos in restored vegetation than in invaded communities. Agamid lizards have been found to be much more common in open areas that are newly weeded and appear to decrease once the vegetation cover increases.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: This project is working to save a number of endemic and critically endangered species that would otherwise be lost to future generations. The coastal ebony forest on Ile aux Aigrettes is the last such remnant in Mauritius, and the restoration and protection of this unique resource is of paramount importance not only for the local population but also for the entire world. It provides habitat for rare and endemic species and represents a symbolic and invaluable hotspot of Earth's remaining biodiversity. 

Besides helping to conserve irreplaceable resources and safeguard Mauritius's natural heritage, MWF's work on Ile aux Aigrettes has made significant contributions to local livelihoods. Activities directly associated with the restoration effort have afforded employment and training opportunities, and the development and promotion of ecotourism on the newly restored island has generated additional income for local communities.
The lessons learned from this project have helped guide the development of restoration work on nearby Rodrigues Island and Round Island. In a couple of notable cases (e.g. Mauritius Fody), species reintroduced to Ile aux Aigrettes have even been used as a source population for the reintroduction of species in these other locations. MWF has long-term leases to manage Ile aux Aigrettes and is expected to continue to raise funds internationally and domestically for its conservation activities (e.g. monitoring and maintenance of project sites). As the project is executed, diminishing maintenance is expected since the restored ecosystems should grow toward a stable climax state. Steps to promote ecotourism on Ile aux Aigrettes began in 1995 as a means of raising public awareness, generating income and employment, and contributing to the sustainable development of Mauritius. In the unlikely event MWF does not renew its lease, the Government of Mauritius may consider visitor fees for Ile aux Aigrettes in order to raise funds to support conservation activities. The project emphasizes strengthening local technical and administrative capacities to identify and respond to similar biodiversity threats in the future, and takes full advantage of the cooperative spirit between government, NGOs and the private sector to establish long-term relationships.

The resultant decomposition of the bog’s peat deposits caused a dramatic influx of mercury and nitrogen levels in runoff from the site and adversely affected the entire Albemarle/Palmico estuary system. In response to increasing anoxia and eutrophication in the estuary, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency funded a non-point-source pollution reduction project in 1994. This project, implemented by the North Carolina Division of Water Quality and North Carolina Division of Forest Resources, was intended to reduce nitrogen and mercury loading of downstream waters by restoring wetland hydrology and native bog vegetation to a 640-acre research area. Practitioners will use the project as a demonstration to guide future restoration efforts over the entire 18,000-acre Pocosin Lakes Atlantic white cedar bog.Deforestation, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry In the 1980s, the Atlantic white cedar bog at Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge was owned by a commercial operation that proposed to mine the area’s peat and construct a large peat-to-methanol synthetic fuel plant. The proposal was later abandoned, but the area had already been cleared, ditched, and drained. The site became part of the wildlife refuge in 1990, and although the transfer of property to Federal ownership ended the threat of peat mining in the area, the site remained devoid of a natural community of plants and animals. Moreover, ditching had aerated the peat, causing it to decompose and release mercury. While total concentrations in surface water reported for the site have been variable, the highest total concentrations recorded after ditching ranged from 800 to 1,100 parts per thousand (Environmental Science and Engineering, Inc. 1982), far exceeding North Carolina’s water quality standards for mercury at 12 parts per thousand. Subsequent reports have documented lower concentrations (N.C. Division of Environmental Management 1983, Evans and others 1984), but levels still exceed accepted standards and jeopardize the integrity of the entire watershed. In addition to high concentrations of mercury, nitrogen in the runoff has likely contributed to eutrophication downstream. Given the low species diversity of the canopy and understories of typical Chamaecyparis thyoides stands””and the importance of this species in its habitat””the restoration of Atlantic white cedar wetlands is largely accomplished by the establishment of C. thyoides. To reduce nitrogen and mercury loading of downstream waters by restoring wetland hydrology and vegetation to a 640-acre research area

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: --Hydrology Restoration and Monitoring--
A water-control structure was installed downstream from the demonstration area in 1996 so that the wetland hydrology could be restored. This structure controls the water regime on 1,500 acres.

--Reforestation--
Approximately 100,000 trees of Atlantic white-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides (L.) B.S.P.), pond pine (Pinus serotina Michaux), and bald cypress (Tawodium distichum (L.) Richard) were planted by machine and by hand on Block B6 (0.5 mile x 1.0 mile) in April 1995. The tract had 16 columns (20 acres each) separated by small V-ditches (oriented north-south), spaced about 320 feet apart. Ditches drain to the south toward Clark-Mill Creek and the upper Pungo River. Elevation is approximately 16 feet above sea level, and depth to water table has varied from 7 to 13 inches.

The experimental design is a randomized complete block with five replications and 14 treatments. Four vegetation types (Atlantic white cedar, pond pine, bald cypress, and control), were combined with two tree-to-tree spacings (8 x 8 feet, and 10 x 10 feet) and two site preparation treatments (none vs. heavy disking). Plots are 2.0 acres, with six plots in each column. There are 70 plots, totaling 140 acres. Undisturbed border areas separate experimental plots, and riparian strips are maintained along v-ditches and canals to protect waterways.

Block 85 (320 acres) was planted in late February 1996, with no site preparation and no protection from deer. Trees were planted directly into the existing vegetation, primarily broom sedge (Andropogon spp). A commercial crew hand planted 233 acres (28,000 Atlantic white-cedar, 27,000 bald cypress, and 15,000 pond pine), using a target density of 300 trees/acre. An additional 25,000 trees, consisting of eight hardwood species, were machine planted. About 2,000 acres have been planted since 1995, mostly with bald cypress and Atlantic white-cedar.

Plots in Block 66 were measured for survival and growth in January 1997. Two circular sub-plots (radius of 30 feet) were installed in each 2-acre plot, yielding a 6 percent sampling intensity. Total number of living trees was noted. Heights and diameters were measured on 5 to 10 trees in each sub-plot. If there were fewer than 10 trees, all were measured. Survival counts were converted to trees per acre, and subjected to analysis of variance to determine treatment effects. Average height of plants was also calculated for each species.

--Water Sampling--
Total mercury, nitrite, nitrate, total ammonia, and pH were sampled at fixed surface-water stations and ground-water wells. Nitrogen samples were analyzed in the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering at NC State University. Samples for total mercury analysis were shipped on ice overnight to Frontier Geosciences (414 Pontius Ave. North, Seattle, WA 98109) for analysis. Mercury concentration was determined in nanograms/liter (parts per thousand). Surface-water samples for total mercury were run unfiltered but were preserved with 5 percent BrCI, due to the turbidity of the samples, and allowed to oxidize overnight prior to analysis. Aliquots of the samples were analyzed using SnCI, reduction, dual gold amalgamation, and cold vapor atomic fluorescence detection (Bloom 1993). Sample analyses, which included quality-control samples and lab performance on precision (repeatability of results based on relative percent deviation of duplicates) and accuracy (based on percent spike recoveries and analyses of standard reference material and blanks), were acceptable.

--Rainfall--
There were two local weather stations from which rainfall data could be compiled for calculations relative to annual rainfall, nutrient inputs, evapo-transpiration, runoff, and nutrient loading. One station was located on the Pungo Unit of the Refuge (approximately 4 miles from the experimental site), the other on Allen Rd (approximately 1 mile from the experimental site). The average of these two stations was used in calculations. Atmospheric inputs of mercury were obtained from data collected as part of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) at Pettigrew State Park on the north side of Lake Phelps (approximately 5 miles from the experimental site). Atmospheric inputs of nitrogen were estimated from air deposition data from the National Acid Deposition/National Trends Network at the Lewiston Station in Bedie County (approximately 60 miles northeast of the experimental site). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: --Survival and Growth in Block B6 (Planted in 1995)--
Target stocking levels were 680 trees/acre at an 8 x 8 foot spacing, and 435 trees/acre at 10 x 10 feet. No inventory was conducted immediately after planting to determine actual plant densities.

The effect of spacing was significant after 2 years in the field. Bald cypress, Atlantic white-cedar, and pond pine planted at 8 x 8 feet averaged 366, 186, and 265 trees/acre, respectively, which was 11, 68, and 27 percent greater than the stocking at 10 x 10 feet. A target density of 8 x 8 feet initially has 55 percent more trees than 10 x 10 feet. The number of trees surviving after 2 years also varied significantly among species. Cypress performed best, averaging 352 trees/acre. This represented an average survival of 63 percent. Atlantic white-cedar sustained the greatest losses, averaging 148 trees/acre. Only 25 percent of the Atlantic white-cedar seedlings survived the first 2 years. Pond pine averaged 237 trees/acre, indicating that 43 percent of the plants lived through the first 2 years.

The result of site preparation varied by species. The difference was primarily with bald cypress; without site preparation, there were 277 trees/acre after 2 years, compared to 427 trees/acre in disked plots. A stocking of 427 trees/acre equates to an average spacing of slightly more than 10 x 10 feet. Stocking levels of Atlantic white-cedar and pond pine were relatively similar between disked and nondisked plots, with Atlantic white-cedar and pond pine averaging 134 to 162 trees/acre, and 224 to 245 trees/acre, respectively.

After 2 years in the field, the only variable that significantly influenced tree height was species. Average total height of bald cypress, Atlantic white-cedar, and pond pine was 24.6, 11.6, and 13.1 inches, respectively. Average height at planting was not determined, but bald cypress was initially much taller than the other two species. In addition, most trees were browsed during the first and second year despite the presence of a Gallagher electric fence. No stem diameters were measured in the 1996 inventory.

--Nitrogen Analysis--
Total Kjeldahl N (TKN), which includes organic N and ammonia, averaged 1.8 to 3.5 mg/liter in surface water. On occasions when NO,-N was measured, the readings (3 decimal places) were zero mg/liter. In addition, the concentration of NO,-N never exceeded 0.02 milligrams/liter, and was usually â‰¤ 0.01 mg/liter. NO,-N was equivalent to approximately 1 percent of the TKN. 

Ammonia in surface water ranged from 0.05 to 0.67 mg/liter, but was mostly I 0.2 mg/liter. The ammonia fraction in surface water was 110 percent except in July 1996 (22 percent).

TKN in surface water exiting the demonstration plot (1.8 to 3.5 mg/liter) is higher than levels recorded at the State downstream ambient water-quality monitoring station, which ranged from 0.5 to 1 mg/liter in 1996 samples. The current level of TKN is only slightly less than levels reported by Environmental Science and Engineering, Inc. for this area in 1982, of 2 to 4.95 mg/liter. In contrast, nitrate/nitrite levels (< 0.01 mg/liter) in surface water exiting the site were lower than those recorded at the ambient station, which ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 mg/liter.

--Mercury Analysis--
Mercury concentrations in unfiltered surface water at the demonstration site ranged from 5.7 to 255 parts per thousand. In both years, the only samples higher than the State standard of 12 parts per thousand were taken in the winter, and all other samples were within the range of values reported for rainfall (National Atmospheric Deposition Program 1997). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: In general, it appeared that bald cypress was less severely browsed than Atlantic white-cedar and will likely outgrow the adverse influence of browsing. Most of the surviving Atlantic white-cedar were heavily browsed, and many plants might eventually succumb or never grow into good trees. On this site, it has been concluded that achieving survival of Atlantic white-cedar commensurate with that of bald cypress will demand additional protection against deer, e.g., plastic or metal netting, sleeves, cages, or different types/configurations of electric fencing. Consequently, experiments are currently being carried out at the site to evaluate various types of deer exclusion.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The restored area should provide downstream water quality benefits (i.e., reduced erosion and surface-water discharges with concentrations of total nitrogen and mercury less than or equal to those in rainfall). Other project benefits include wildlife habitat restoration, contributions to the scientific literature on wetland restoration, and the potential for this large demonstration project on restoration of Atlantic white-cedar, bald cypress, and pond pine to serve as a catalyst for the replanting of these wetland trees on private lands with deep organic soils. All these species are valuable for timber and are adapted to grow under wetland hydrologic regimes.
Restoration of the Atlantic white cedar ecosystem at Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge is a long-term effort. Improvements to the site’s hydrology and vegetative community have already reduced mercury runoff to levels that are better than the State water quality standard. The ultimate goal is to have water leaving the site with mercury and nitrogen concentrations equal to, or less than, rainfall concentrations. Restoring the hydrology has also encouraged the growth of moss (Spagnum spp) and improved habitat for small mammals and amphibians. In 3 to 4 more years, the trees should be large enough to provide nesting sites for many neo-tropical songbirds. Researchers believe that the level of TKN can be reduced by raising water levels so that the peat is saturated during the winter and part of the growing season. Now that all tree planting and work requiring machinery on site have been completed, the water level can be elevated so that the site is wet enough to be delineated as a jurisdictional wetland, which requires that “the soil is saturated to the surface at some time during the growing season of the prevalent vegetation” (Environmental Laboratory 1987). A covering of several inches of water over the peat will be maintained from December through February, and the site will be inundated or saturated at or near the peat surface between 12.5 and 25 percent (30 to 60 days) of the growing season so that the area meets the hydrologic criteria for seasonably flooded wetlands (Tiner 1994). The goal is to have water exiting the site no higher in concentration of total nitrogen than rainfall, which was approximately 1 mg/liter in 1996. Maintaining water on the site will also prevent the peat from freezing and thawing in the winter, which is thought to have contributed to the high winter values of mercury recorded.
In addition to the 640-acre research area, another 1,330 acres have been replanted to primarily bald cypress and Atlantic white cedar. Plans are underway to restore wetland hydrology on the remaining acreage by installing a total of 14 water control structures on canals that drain the area. "

The oil spill injured seabirds and other aquatic life from Point Reyes to the Big Sur coast (Map, File 1). Approximately 9,000 seabirds were killed, including 6,300 common murres (Uria aalge; Carter et al. 2003). Restoration funds were recovered from the responsible party under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and National Marine Sanctuaries Act, the California Harbors and Navigation Code, and other state law. Under the natural resource damage assessment provisions of the CWA, recovered damages shall be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of natural resources injured or destroyed as a result of the oil spill. A trustee council, made up of representatives of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), was established to review, select, and oversee implementation of restoration actions for natural resources injured by the spill. A Common Murre Restoration Project (CMRP) was developed with the goal to recolonize common murres at historic breeding colonies in the areas where they were extirpated or severely depleted by the oil spill. From 1996 through 2005, social attraction (decoys, mirrors and recorded vocalizations of common murres) was used to attract common murres to nest at Devil’s Slide Rock and other historic nearshore colonies in the vicinity of San Francisco. Common murres are monitored at these sites and at reference sites in the vicinity of Point Reyes and Big Sur in order to evaluate and refine the recolonization project. Monitored parameters include colony size, reproductive success, behavior, and breeding phenology of common murres. In addition, anthropogenic factors (e.g., boat disturbance, aircraft overflights, oiling) and natural factors (e.g., predation, diet, climatic fluctuations) that affect the success of recolonization efforts have been documented. In 2005, after ten years of restoration efforts, the project had exceeded the goal of establishing 100 breeding pairs of common murres at Devil’s Slide Rock for six consecutive years. Breeding by common murres on the adjacent Devil’s Slide mainland was also established.Contamination (biological, chemical, physical or radiological) The APEX HOUSTON oil spill, which occurred from Point Reyes (Lat 37.993 Lon -122.536) to Point Sur (Lat 36.306 Lon -121.896), California, (Map, File 1) killed an estimated 8,978 seabirds in February 1986 (Carter et al. 2003). This mortality included 6,287 common murres, 1,293 rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata), 180 small alcids, 12 marbled murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus), and 1,206 other birds (including loons, grebes, scoters, cormorants, shorebirds, and gulls; Siskin et al. 1993). The common murre colony at Devil’s Slide Rock was abandoned, certain subcolonies at the Castle Rocks and Mainland colony (near Point Sur) disappeared, and other central California breeding colonies were greatly reduced after the spill (Takekawa et al. 1990, Carter et al. 2001). The central California population currently represents the southernmost colonies for breeding common murres in the Pacific. The reductions of the geographic range, fragile condition of the central California population, and murre demographics increase the risk that future catastrophic events (e.g., oil spills, disease, predation, climate change) would result in extirpation of the central California common murre population. Common murres are an important and visible part of the California seabird community (Carter et al. 1992). They are the most abundant nesting species and have the greatest biomass of all breeding seabirds in the state (Sowls et al. 1980, Ainley and Boekelheide 1990). Nearshore breeding colonies of common murres throughout central coastal California (Point Arena to Big Sur) decreased by about 60 percent between 1980 and 1986 (Takekawa et al. 1990). This population decline was attributed to high mortality from gill-net fishing, oil spills (including the 1986 Apex Houston spill), and a severe El Niño-Southern Oscillation event in 1982 and 1983 (Takekawa et al. 1990; Swartzman and Carter 1991; Carter et al. 1992, 2001). Fom 1980 through 1982, prior to this decline, there were close to 3,000 common murres breeding on Devil’s Slide Rock. The goal of the CMRP was to restore common murres at historic breeding colonies in the areas where colonies were extirpated or severely depleted by the APEX HOUSTON oil spill. Given the depleted condition of the central California common murre population (Ainley and Boekelheide 1990; Takekawa et al. 1990; Carter et al. 1992, 2001,2003; Ainley and Lewis 1994), extirpated colonies were not likely to be reestablished without human assistance. The recolonization of abandoned common murre colonies in central California would aid in securing the common murre population and will spread the risk of future disasters among colony sites over a wider range of the California coast, subsequently decreasing the risk that future catastrophic events will result in extirpation of the central California population.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
A trustee council, made up of representatives of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), was established to review, select, and oversee implementation of restoration actions for natural resources injured by the spill. The USFWS’s San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge Complex was chosen to lead the restoration efforts for common murres. A restoration plan was written and finalized in 1995 after substantial public review (Federal Register,Vol.60, No. 81 / April 27, 1995 / 20739-20749; attached File 3). The common murre restoration work is overseen by a trustee council and conducted cooperatively by USFWS, Humboldt State University, and the National Audubon Society with additional assistance from several other public and private institutions.

Description of Project Activities: (1) Research and Planning
Studies of seabird colonies in Maine demonstrated that recolonization can be achieved using social attraction (Kress 1978, Kress and Nettleship 1988, Kress et al. 1992). The use of decoys and tape recordings of bird calls attracted prospecting seabirds, which then bred, once a threshold group size was reached. These techniques have assisted in the recolonization of several colonial nesting seabird species (Podolsky 1985; Podolsky and Kress 1989, 1992) and have been utilized in an effort to recolonize common murres in Maine.  Study results indicated that a combination of visual and sound stimuli are essential to attract common murres.

In order to refine recolonization methods and evaluate their success, reference information was needed on the reproductive biology, behavior, and phenology of common murres at unmanipulated nearshore sites in the local area. However, little information was available from nearshore colonies in central California. Monitoring attendance patterns, arrival dates, reproductive success, and behavior of breeding and nonbreeding common murres at accessible colonies at Point Reyes and Big Sur provided comparisons to evaluate recolonization of Devil's Slide and San Pedro rocks.  The large Point Reyes colony is the closest easily accessible colony to the recolonization sites (approximately 60 km distant). Monitoring of the Big Sur colonies (Castle Rocks, Mainland and Hurricane Point Rocks) also provided information to guide management decisions to restore those highly depleted colonies.  The monitoring conducted at these unmanipulated colonies was used to assess recolonization responses and common murre activity patterns at recolonization sites, aiding in refinement of recolonization methods, and to assess potential restoration needs at other colonies.

(2) Implementation
Social attraction techniques similar to those used in Maine were used at Devil's Slide Rock (Lat 37.5773 Lon -122.5233) and San Pedro Rock (Lat 37.5953 Lon -122.5222) which are located approximately 1.8 km apart, and 0.25 and 0.1 km from the shoreline, respectively (See File 2, Google Earth perspective).  Decoys, mirrors, and audio equipment were first placed on Devil's Slide Rock in January 1996 before the common murre breeding season. Four hundred sixty-eight life-size common murre decoys (including 384 adult, 48 egg, and 36 chick) were positioned on suitable nesting habitat on Devil's Slide Rock in a fashion that simulated an active murre colony (Parker et al. 2007).  Four omni-directional weather resistant loudspeakers were positioned on the rock and recordings of common murre vocalizations were played prior to and throughout the breeding season, from January to August.  Daily observations of the recolonization sites began once decoys had been deployed and continued until breeding activities ended in late July or early August and all chicks departed.  Data collected on common murres included daily and seasonal attendance patterns, breeding phenology, breeding success, adult behavior, location on rock, diet or feeding behavior, and predation. Prospecting common murres were plotted by location on maps of the recolonization site. Aerial photographic censuses were conducted annually between May and June. The censuses were used to calculate annual breeding population sizes at the recolonization sites and nearby reference colonies, assess trends between years, and assist in determining numbers of common murres not visible from the mainland or boats.  Following the breeding season, all decoys were removed from the rock for cleaning and repair, and the sound system was turned off.

Each winter through 2005, decoys were redeployed on Devil's Slide Rock and the sound system was turned back on.  The social attraction setup (numbers of decoys, etc.) was fairly consistent through 1998.  Beginning in 1999, the numbers of decoys deployed each year decreased steadily, and mirrors were removed from areas where they were no longer needed.  Following the 2005 season, social attraction was discontinued.

On San Pedro Rock, a similar social attraction setup was installed in spring 1998.  Social attraction was continued until 2004, when the devices were removed due to lack of murre activity.

(3) Education and Outreach
This restoration project provided unique opportunities to enhance public knowledge concerning seabirds, seabird conservation, and the marine environment. An extensive education program for local 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students was conducted from 1996 to 2005.  This included a presentation about seabird adaptations, effects of gill nets, oil, and other pollution on seabirds and the marine environment, and the Devil's Slide restoration project.  As a culmination to the project students repainted the murre decoys in preparation for redeployment.  When remote-controlled video cameras were placed on the rock in 2005 through 2007, live-streaming video of the Devil's Slide Rock common murre colony was made accessible to the public for education and outreach through a live web cam and display at the Point Montara Lighthouse Hostel.  Additional education and outreach was conducted through public presentations, news coverage, and a project web site. 

(4) Results.
Common murres recolonized Devil's Slide Rock during the first season of social attraction efforts, with six breeding pairs.  Numbers increased gradually thereafter, and the 10-year project goal of establishing 100 breeding pairs of murres was first reached in year 5 (2000).  In 2005, after ten years of restoration activities and monitoring, the colony had exceeded this goal for six consecutive years.  As an additional benefit, a new nesting area on the adjacent Devil's Slide mainland was first colonized in 2005.  By 2007, the Devil's Slide Rock colony had grown to 394 breeding pairs, with an additional 50 pairs on the adjacent mainland.  Other colonies in central California had also increased dramatically since the mid-1990s.  San Pedro Rock attracted occasional visiting murres but was not recolonized.

Monitoring data indicated that attendance patterns, behavior and reproduction of murres on Devil's Slide Rock was similar to reference colonies. However, colonies were affected annually by both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic factors.  Early monitoring efforts at the Big Sur colonies discovered that gill-net mortality in the nearby Monterey Bay and Morro Bay areas and disturbance from aircraft and boats were having an impact on the murres.  Project personnel provided information about these impacts to state regulators which aided in their decision to impose stricter rules on the gill-net fishery.  To address other human disturbances, the project used outreach and limited enforcement to notify aviators and boaters about the affect of their activities on the colonies and the laws protecting seabirds.  Over time, these impacts to the Big Sur colonies were reduced dramatically. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: On Devil's Slide Rock in 2004, 190 breeding pairs of common murres fledged 133 chicks.  In 2005, 164 pairs produced 52 chicks.  Social attractants have not been deployed since the 2005 breeding season as the murre population has reached a level where it appears to be self-sustaining.  In 2007, after two years without social attraction, the colony had grown to almost 400 breeding pairs. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic disturbances influence the common murre colony's annual production.  Oil spills remain a threat as the California coast is a main shipping route for the oil industry, and small spills occur often.  Disturbance from aircraft and boats also has impacted colonies, especially at Big Sur and Devil's Slide (Rojek et al. 2007). At Devil's Slide, murres may be more likely to flush in response to low-flying aircraft and closely-approaching boats now that the decoys and audio equipment have been removed.  Unfortunately, Devil's Slide Rock lies in the path of a local airport's approach and take-off.
In recent years, there has been an increase in brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), an endangered species, roosting in the murre breeding areas.  Some murres have abandoned breeding sites and lost eggs due to disturbances caused by these large birds.

Global climate change may also influence the Devil's Slide Rock common murre colony in the future. Warming trends and El Niño-associated climate conditions are affecting foraging conditions.  In addition, the rock is located on the southern end of the murre breeding range, where climatic change is more likely to have an impact as the birds are already living at the limits of their adaptive tolerance.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The CMRP has provided a unique opportunity for local community involvement. Volunteers from various organizations have helped to deploy the social attraction equipment as well as help to clean and repaint the decoys each season.  The project's current educational program, Webs Under Waves: Exploring Coastal Marine Life, explores the food webs of the central California coastal marine environment and teaches students about the San Francisco Bay and adjacent ocean habitats, the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, Farallon National Wildlife Refuge, and Devil's Slide Rock, including adaptations of the common murre and what students can do to help protect the marine environment.
The placement of remote video cameras on Devil's Slide Rock enabled students to observe and record data in a science journal of common murres and other seabird activity from the live web cam during the mating and breeding season.  In addition, the ""Murre Maniac"" newsletter contains information on the murre colony at Devil's Slide Rock and how it fares during the breeding season. Major events such as first egg lay dates, numbers of eggs and chicks on the rock, and last chick fledge dates are discussed, as well as general seabird breeding behavior. Current data from the scientists' observations, such as numbers from bi-weekly colony population counts, are provided for teachers to pass on to students who keep track of how the bird population changes on the rock throughout the breeding season.
A documentary film about the project, called ""Returning Home: Bringing the Common Murre Back to Devil's Slide Rock,"" was produced by Full Frame Productions and released on VHF in 1999.  A slightly revised version, produced in 2006 for the PBS series ""Natural Heroes,"" was released on DVD, and has been shown at several environmental film festivals.
Researchers feel that the short time interval between colony extirpation and the initiation of restoration activities (about ten years) had a positive influence on the success of the project. Given the naturally long life span of common murres, the initial recolonizers likely were either hatched or had bred on the rock before the colony was abandoned (Parker et al. 2007). Within twenty-four hours after first deploying the social attraction devices, murres were utilizing Devil’s Slide Rock and six breeding pairs fledged three chicks in the first breeding season. The lack of recolonization of San Pedro Rock, which was extirpated early in the twentieth century, showed that success is not guaranteed even when habitat and conditions appear favorable. Comparisons between the two restoration sites will help guide future efforts. Maintaining the geographic range and numbers of breeding common murres along the central California coastline decreases the risk that future catastrophic events will result in extirpation of central California populations. Since 2005, efforts have continued to monitor the status of Devil’s Slide Rock and other central California colonies, and conduct surveillance for human disturbance and other factors affecting population growth, with funds from the Command Oil Spill Restoration Plan. In the event of subsequent catastrophic events, recolonization activities could be implemented where indicated. "

Investigation of the factors associated with the decline of this hummingbird revealed that nesting Juan Fernández Firecrowns prefer native forest without invasive plant cover. In response, a forest habitat restoration program was undertaken which includes (1) investigation of effective methods of control of invasive plants, (2) investigation of effective outplanting techniques for native plants, (3) assessment of the response of firecrowns to habitat restoration, and (4) efforts to increase active participation by local residents in restoration.Deforestation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Mining & Resource Extraction The Juan Fernández Islands, Chile, escaped early human disturbance, although cascading effects of human influence began with the islands’ discovery in 1574. Humans heavily harvested timber resources and marine mammals, and have been responsible for a multitude of deliberate and accidental species’ introductions. The 1574 voyage of Juan Fernández left goats and pigs on the island, and subsequent visitors and colonists introduced cattle, sheep, dogs, cats, coati, rabbits, rats, mice, 260 species of exotic plants, and undocumented fungi and insects. There are no native land mammals in the archipelago, and introduced mammals are dramatically changing native systems. Introduced mammals, such as coati, rodents and cats, have been tied to bird predation. Introduced mammalian herbivores can decimate native plants unaccustomed to grazing pressures, providing opportunities for introduced plants to dominate vegetation cover. Regeneration of native vegetation of Juan Fernández has been slowed by introduced goats, rabbits and rodents, as well as by vigorous establishment by introduced plants such as maqui (Aristotelia chilensis, Eleocarpaceae), murtilla (Ugni molinae, Myrtaceae) and zarzamora (Rubus ulmifolius, Rosaceae). The small fraction of the island ecosystem that remains undegraded is restricted to the upper reaches of the island; at lower elevations direct human impact is more common, with associated increases in introduced plants, soil erosion and disturbance. The loss of native forest continues as introduced species continue to invade unchecked.
Native bird species adapted to the native forest communities have shown declines in populations. However, little work has been done to quantitatively assess breeding biology, predation pressures, habitat demands or population levels through time (however, see Hahn 2002). The endemic Juan Fernández Firecrown (Sephanoides fernandensis) is listed as critically endangered in the IUCN red list owing to its low population numbers and a distribution restricted to only one island in the world, Robinson Crusoe. Recent population estimates suggest around 1,000 individuals, which may represent a 10 fold reduction from the early 1900s when it was common in the forests. As this hummingbird population declined, that of the Green-backed Firecrown (Sephanoides sephaniodes), self-introduced in the 1830s, has increased to en estimated 3,000. Population declines of the Juan Fernández firecrown appear to be related to habitat loss exacerbated by predation pressure by cats, increases in exotic plants that decrease available nest habitat and food resources, and competition with the Green-backed Firecrown.
There is only one permanent human settlement on the island, the town of San Juan Bautista, where approximately 600 people reside. Historic resource extraction has been limited, and alternative timber sources are provided by introduced species plantations near town. However, species introductions continue with the arrival of goods and materials from continental Chile. Although residents’ environmental awareness has increased dramatically in the last 15 years, few active environmental protection programs exist for terrestrial or marine ecosystem conservation. The forests of Robinson Crusoe Island are composed of a suite of endemic trees. Luma (Myrceugenia fernandeziana) dominates forests, and the distribution of a variety of ferns (tree, climbing, arboreal) and a diversity of plants, including endemic trees naranjillo (Fagara mayu), juan bueno (Rhaphithamnus venustus), canelo (Drimys confertifolia) and manzano (Boermia excelsa), depends upon elevation, slope and aspect. The island has a steep mountainous spine that runs its length, rendering some areas inaccessible and also creating a variety of microclimatic conditions. The Juan Fernández Firecrown was abundant across the island, with nests commonly encountered. These investigations will broaden scientific understanding of this unique ecosystem as well as to inform management actions to restore populations of this endangered bird species. Our proximate goals are to determine effective control methods of introduced plants and effective outplanting methods for native plants, to measure the response of nesting firecrowns to restored habitat, and to increase active participation in restoration by local residents. Our ultimate goals are to restore native forest assemblages and the Juan Fernández Firecrown population, safeguarding these native species against global extinction. This project arose out of an urging from the national park personnel, interested in advancing firecrown conservation.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Juan Fernández Firecrown is a flagship species for the Juan Fernández Archipelago and the Juan Fernández National Park. After the local lobster fishery, tourism is the second largest contributor to island incomes. Many tourists are attracted to the islands by the large number of endemic species, including the Juan Fernández Firecrown and the unique assemblages of native forest plant species. The national park has control over the protection of species and ecosystems within its borders, however local islanders are increasingly interested in protecting native species and systems as well.

Description of Project Activities: The Juan Fernández Firecrown has faced dramatic population declines, presumably linked to habitat loss. As the first quantitative assessment of nesting habitat, during 2003 and 2004, we characterized vegetation cover surrounding nest locations and compared them to non-nest locations within 12 ha of forest. Understory cover by invasive plants was the strongest predictor of nest absence.
 
Mechanical and chemical invasive plant control was undertaken in sensitive nesting areas. Mechanical control alone was insufficient in preventing aggressive regrowth of invasive plants such as Aristotelia chilensis (maqui), and Rubus ulmifolius (elmleaf blackberry), however chemical application within 4 hours after mechanical treatment was effective. Annual control has continued in this area, and is accompanied by measures of efficacy and regeneration of native and invasive plant species. In addition, in 2006-8, survivorship of nests was assessed, and data await analysis examining the relationship between invasive plant control and nesting success in this sensitive endemic hummingbird.  Results will indicate the effectiveness of plant control in hummingbird habitat restoration and indicate future directions for recovery work.

We began an additional investigation April 2008 in a degraded native forest to compare efficacy of outplanting techniques.  Two endemic trees which provide nectar food resources for the hummingbird, Sophora fernandeziana (madera dura) and Rhaphitamnus venustus (juan bueno), were outplanted under 3 experimental treatments after reaching 3 years in the greenhouse.  We collect growth and survival measurements regularly and results will inform appropriate techniques for outplanting these species.  In addition to these anticipated results, this research has also generated much needed discussion and involvement surrounding restoration among various stakeholders, such as the national park, the agriculture department, scientists, conservation non-profit technicians and the community.

All aspects of the investigations described here were executed through close collaborations between the U.S. based scientists and local residents, as park personnel were involved in all planning stages, and local residents were trained as field technicians and participated in, and led, plant control and outplanting.  In addition, a network of local volunteers assisted in both plant control and outplanting activities as well. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-california-forest-restoration-in-campgrounds-at-kings-canyon-national-park/	USA: California: Forest Restoration in Campgrounds at Kings Canyon National Park	United States of America	2004-04-25	2007-04-25	"Intensive campground use at the Grant Grove area of Kings Canyon National Park, California, has compacted the soil and left areas without understory vegetation or tree recruitment. To better inform the restoration of these sites after closure, natural regeneration potential was tested against planting and soil restoration methods. The tested methods included planting with container stock and direct seeding, fencing, and soil treatments of tilling, mulching, and gypsum and humus additions. Container stock showed high survivorship (69 – 100%), while germination and survival from direct seeding was low (0.6 – 4.1%). Wood chip mulch proved beneficial to planting woody species, but detrimental to resident herbaceous species. Plots treated with tilling and gypsum, and humus amendments exhibited the highest growth rates of container stock and the greatest herbaceous species richness and cover. However, tilling without the other soil treatments reduced herbaceous cover and seedling recruitment (natural and sown). In tilled plots, gypsum treatments and humus treatments often had neutral or detrimental effects individually, but their combination greatly increased the success of direct seeding, growth of container stock, and herbaceous cover and richness. Finally, fencing increased volunteer tree recruitment tenfold compared to outside the plots. The data yielded by this study will be used to plan and implement larger restoration projects in area campgrounds.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The Grant Grove region of Kings Canyon National Park has three campgrounds, covering approximately 32 ha and containing about 200 campsites. The grass, forb, shrub, and tree seedling understory is largely absent because of high visitor use and associated trampling. Both soil compaction and soil erosion are evident in heavily used areas and have been reducing natural regeneration for many years. In fact, results from comparative surveys of campgrounds in the Grant Grove region revealed that even after being closed for two or three years, these campground areas exhibit very limited recovery of litter depth and herbaceous species richness and no recruitment of woody species, compared to nearby relatively undisturbed sites (Infalt, unpub. data). In addition, from 1997 to 1999, the Grant Grove area experienced an infestation of Douglas fir tussock moths (Orgyia pseudotsugata), part of a much wider infestation in the southern Sierra Nevada, that killed most of the mature overstory trees. Overstory vegetation is now lacking in large areas of the campgrounds. Hazard tree removals and the long-term trampling of the Grant Grove campgrounds have produced a highly degraded and nonsustainable forest structure and have decreased or eliminated wildlife habitat. Two reference sites were surveyed within 1.7 km of the experimental plots to provide a target for future restoration efforts in Grant Grove. The target community agreed upon with park managers was a forest patch that had burned approximately 10 to 20 years ago and had been left to natural succession. One site had experienced prescribed burning 19 years prior to the survey, and the other site had experienced prescribed burning 22 years prior to the survey. We documented that the dominant tree species are Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), white fir (Abies concolor), and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), with scattered groves of giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum). Common shrubs include dogbane (Apocynum androsaemifolium), manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.), littleleaf ceanothus (Ceanothus parvifolius), whitethorn (Ceanothus cordulatus), chinquapin (Chrysolepis sempervirens), bitter cherry (Prunus emarginata), snowberry (Symphoricarpos mollis), elderberry (Sambucus mexicana), and gooseberry (Ribes roezlii) (botanical nomenclature follows Botti 2001). 1) To examine the potential for natural regeneration (passive restoration)
2) To test the effectiveness of soil treatments alone at increasing natural regeneration (low-input active restoration)
3) To test the effectiveness of soil treatments at increasing natural regeneration in combination with horticultural planting treatments (high-input active restoration)

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Twenty-five 6 m x 6 m plots were located around Crystal Springs campground in areas with moderate degradation between individual campsites. Plots were enclosed with post and rope fencing to exclude humans. Five soil treatments were applied in five randomly selected replicates: 1) control; 2) soil tilling; 3) soil tilling and gypsum addition; 4) soil tilling and humus addition; and 5) soil tilling with gypsum and humus additions. Plots receiving the tilling treatment were cultivated to a depth of 10 cm with a small rototiller. Gypsum was applied to plots at a rate of 225 g/mÂ² and tilled in to a depth of 10 cm. For humus treatments, decomposed bark (ground fir and pine bark, ( 6 mm particle size, 0.2 - 0.4% nitrogen, 4.0 - 5.0 pH) was spread to a depth of 5 cm and tilled.

Each plot was divided into 36 1 m x 1 m subplots. In each plot, nine treatment combinations were assigned to each of four tree species: Jeffrey pine, incense cedar, white fir, and sugar pine. Subplots were assigned one of three planting-stock treatments: control (no planting), 1-gallon container stock, and direct seeding. The control plots were used to monitor background levels of seed rain/natural recruitment, as well as an area off the southeast corner outside of each plot of the same size and shape. The container stock was produced as bare-root seedlings at the USDA Forest Service Nursery in Placerville, California, with seeds collected from the Grant Grove area. After one year, the bare-root stock was then shipped to the park and immediately potted by the Sequoia and Kings Canyon nursery. Plants were 2 - 5 years old (depending on species) at the time of planting. Seeds for direct seeding treatments were also supplied by the USDA Forest Service Nursery from seeds collected in Grant Grove.

Each subplot was also assigned a mulch treatment: control (no mulch), wood chip mulch, or native litter/duff mulch. Wood chips produced on site from the tussock moth logging operation were used for the woodchip treatment subplots. Native litter was collected from outside the campground boundary for the native mulch treatments. Mulch was applied to the entire subplot area to a depth of 5 cm.

Plots were established in August and September 2004 after collecting baseline measurements of soil and vegetation conditions. First, plots were delineated and fenced, and then the soil treatments were added. Container stock was planted over a two-week period in September of 2004. Six liters of water were added to the planting hole. After the water percolated into the soil profile, the container stock was planted, the holes were backfilled with native soil, small berms were created around the trees, and an additional 6 L of water per tree were provided. Two additional bi-weekly waterings were carried out until the rainy season began. Directly seeded subplots received either 10 Jeffrey pine seeds, 10 white fir seeds, or 9 sugar pine seeds in a grid pattern (to aid in later identification as either directly seeded germinants or volunteers). No incense cedar seed of local genetic stock was available at the time of seeding, and a limited number of sugar pine seeds were available. Plots with the direct seed and mulch treatment were first mulched, then holes were poked through the mulch bed and seeds were placed on bare mineral soil. Seeds were covered with soil to a depth twice their diameter.

Plots were surveyed after one year for growth (height and caliper) of planted trees, germination and survival of planted seed, seedling establishment from natural seed rain, herbaceous and shrub species richness and cover, and soil penetration resistance. We visually estimated cover on each subplot aided by a 1-m2 quadrat with 10-cm grid. In September 2007 (three years after initiating the experiment), the plots were resurveyed. All planted container stock was assessed for survivorship and height growth. Plots were surveyed for percent herbaceous cover, number of herbaceous species, and number of woody species. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: --Planting Treatments--
Although the four planted tree species differed significantly in first-year (2004 - 2005) survivorship rates in the one-gallon planting stock, all exhibited high survivorship (69% - 100%). Survivorship between 2005 and 2007 was also high (73%-94%). First-year diameter growth did not differ significantly among species, but incense cedar and Jeffrey pine grew in height twice as fast as sugar pine, with white fir being intermediate. Between 2005 and 2007, Jeffrey pine grew significantly more in height (9.8 cm) than the other three species, which exhibited no net growth overall, mostly because of shoot-tip herbivory.

Germination establishment success differed significantly among species, but was very low overall. On average, 2.5% of all seeds sown into the plots had germinated and survived to the end of the first year (4.1% of Jeffrey pine, 2.9% of sugar pine, and 0.6% of white fir). 

Subplots with a planting treatment (container stock or seed addition) had slightly lower average herbaceous species cover than subplots that were assigned no planting treatment (9% vs. 11%). This difference is small, but it does suggest that either the disturbance at the time of planting or seeding or the competition from the woody species additions will slightly reduce herbaceous cover, at least initially.

--Mulch Treatments--
Woodchip mulching increased first-year survivorship of container stock compared to the control and native litter mulching, but not survivorship between 2005 and 2007. Similarly, volunteer tree seedling recruitment was greatest on subplots with woodchip mulch, followed by subplots without mulch, then subplots with native litter mulch. In contrast, herbaceous species cover and species richness were greater in the absence of mulch, and the woodchip mulch was more detrimental than the native litter mulch.

--Tilling, Gypsum, and Humus Soil Treatments--
Tilling was successful at reducing soil compaction. Plots that additionally received humus had the greater reductions in penetration resistance, changing the average from 339 psi before plot installations to 300 psi for plots without humus, and from 355 psi before treatment application to 223 psi for plots with humus.

Tilling generally reduced herbaceous cover, unless it was associated with both humus and gypsum. Year 1 height growth (and diameter increase) of container stock was greatest in plots that received all three amendments (tilling, gypsum, and humus) and plots that received tilling and humus. Between 2005 and 2007, many planted seedlings experienced considerable shoot-tip herbivory that negated positive growth in some treatments. Herbaceous species richness and cover were greatest in plots with all three treatments and (in 2005) control plots. Total seedling recruitment (natural seed rain and sown seeds) was greater in untilled plots than in tilled plots (0.6 vs. 0.4 seedlings/m2).

Container stock in the humus addition plots increased in height 75% more between 2004 and 2005 than trees planted in non-humus plots (2.8 cm vs. 1.6 cm), and increased in trunk caliper 55% more (1.5 mm vs. 0.97 mm). Herbaceous cover in plots with humus was 24% greater than plots without humus (10.9% vs. 8.8%), and herbaceous species richness was 12% higher in plots with humus (1.9 species/m2 vs. 1.7 species/m2). A significant tilling-by-mulch interaction revealed that tilling was more detrimental to herbaceous cover when mulch was also applied. There were fewer seedlings from sown and volunteer seeds in humus-treated plots.

--Interactions between Humus and Gypsum Treatments--
There was a set of interesting interactions between humus and gypsum treatments. Although gypsum alone or humus alone often had neutral or detrimental effects, the combination of both soil treatments substantially increased herbaceous species cover and richness and the growth of container stock.

--Volunteer Seed Rain--
There was ten times more volunteer tree recruitment inside the fenced plots than in areas directly outside the plots (0.53 seedlings/m2 vs. 0.04 seedlings/m2 outside). Of the volunteer tree seedlings, 79% were incense cedar, 15% were sugar pine, 4% were white fir, and 1% were Jeffrey pine; there were a negligible number of unidentified seedlings. There were fewer volunteer seedlings in plots that were tilled (0.32 vs. 0.51 seedlings/m2) and in humus plots that were also tilled (0.26 vs. 0.42 seedlings/m2). Although there was some shrub recruitment, there were no detectable differences among treatments. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: --Planting Treatments--
The direct seeding treatment had very low success rates. Recruitment rates from directly sown seeds averaged 2.5%, while laboratory germination tests yielded an average of over 95% viability from the same seed lots. It is suspected that this difference was due to seed predation, but planting sites were not examined for such herbivory. 

--Mulch Treatments--
It is intuitive that wood chip mulch would increase the success of container stock and decrease the success of herbaceous species, compared with controls. It is less clear why native litter mulch would have intermediate effects. It was initially suspected that native litter mulching treatments might increase recruitment success of woody species via viable seeds present in the native litter. However, native litter had a negative impact on volunteer recruitment of woody species. It is possible that the adult litter had allelopathic effects on seeds (Bai et al. 2000). Native litter mulching may be useful in areas that managers wish to keep clear of woody vegetation, but further studies would be needed to determine the cause of the reduction in germination and the long-term effects of native mulch.

--Tilling, Gypsum, and Humus Soil Treatments--
Tilling alone was detrimental to the first-year success of herbaceous species and germinating seedlings. This negative effect was overcome on plots that received the tilling, gypsum, and humus treatment. As with the mulching treatments, it is clear that objectives must be identified before treatments are applied, since the treatments in this study were often detrimental to species of one group (forbs) while being beneficial to another (tree seedlings). If herbaceous species or natural woody recruitment is the management target, the high-input tilling, gypsum, and humus treatments are no better than installing protective fencing only, and would not be worth the extra time and expense. If management goals are aimed at higher growth rates of container stock, then the tilling, gypsum, and humus treatment and the tilling and humus treatment might be worthwhile, though tilling alone does not seem to provide any appreciable benefit to sites with the moderate level of compaction found in the campgrounds of the Grant Grove area.

--Volunteer Seedlings--
Although there was an abundance of volunteer seedlings on control plots (Infalt, unpub. data), the species composition was not proportional to that of the mature or sapling overstory. Incense cedar is extremely prolific and seedlings were observed in all microsites (shaded areas, full sun areas, bare mineral soil, and areas with a duff layer). White fir seedlings were nearly absent because most mature white fir in the area were killed during the moth infestation, but it is not clear why Jeffrey pine and sugar pine seedlings were not more abundant.
Although the treatments in this study increased the success of some herbaceous and woody species and ameliorated some of the structural soil degradation, the more intensive (expensive) methods may not be necessary to meet restoration and management goals. Human-exclosure fencing alone produced high levels of woody and herbaceous recruitment in many areas. It seems that the campgrounds in the Grant Grove area have not degraded so far that tilling and amendments are necessary to produce an acceptable level of natural recruitment. Nonetheless, some of the more compacted, exposed areas were completely void of natural vegetation after three years even with fencing, tilling, soil amendments, and seed addition. These types of areas will need to be planted with container stock to produce levels of rehabilitation similar to reference site conditions. Although the densities of natural recruitment of some species on control plots were high, planting or seeding still appears to be necessary to reestablish a natural range of species. This study was intended to test the efficacy and feasibility of various methods for restoring arboreal vegetation in degraded campgrounds, and the observations made here will help guide and inform future restoration projects within Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.

The broad aim of the project is to restore and enhance some of the most important areas of bog woodland and floodplain woodland in the United Kingdom, being located on or adjacent to four candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSAC) designated for these habitats under the EU Habitats Directive: Monadh Mor on the Black Isle; Pitmaduthy in Easter Ross; the Conon Islands on the river Conon; Abernethy in Strathspey; and Inshriach at the foot of the Cairngorms. Although restoration treatments varied by site, they generally included removal of non-native coniferous tree species, thinning of planted Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), and damming of drainage canals responsible for altering natural hydrologic conditions. The project has proven highly successful, achieving 98% of the stated target for hydrological restoration (363 ha at six sites) and well over the target for habitat restoration (329 ha at six sites). Due to the importance of these woodlands and their inclusion under existing commitments to nature conservation, subsequent monitoring and management activities will be ongoing.Agriculture & Livestock, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Despite the fact that the cSAC sites targeted by this project can be counted amongst the best examples of wet woods habitats in the UK, all have experienced some degree of interference with the hydrological systems upon which their integrity depends. Some bog woodland sites, for example, have been drained for agriculture, plantation forestry and other land uses, while similar disturbances in their immediate catchment area have affected the quantity and quality of water entering the system.
The fertile sites of residual alluvial forests have also been cleared for arable farming and grazing or planted with commercial trees. Water use and drainage upstream has, in many cases, altered water quality and seasonal flooding patterns, as have engineering works for flood prevention. These factors, together with the displacement of natural vegetation by exotic trees and shrubs, have led to a decline in the condition of most surviving wet woods. –Area–
The structure and function of bog woodlands is finely balanced between tree growth and bog development. In a naturally stable system, tree growth is always slow (or the trees would take over the bog), and the trees are likely to be widely-spaced owing to the fact that much of the surface area is too wet for them to establish. Thus, a target to be employed in the implementation of this project will be for “no net loss.”
Loss of bog woodland area to woodland can be assumed when the trees have a closed canopy and the ground vegetation loses the characteristic Sphagnum spp. dominance. If conditions get wetter, loss of bog woodland to bog might be assumed when there are no trees (including stunted trees), or all trees are dead, within approx. 1/2 hectare (70m by 70m square).
–Tree Cover–
A second requirement of bog woodland is that there should be a relatively open canopy. Bog woodland has been defined as the stable condition whereby both the woodland and the bog elements are maintained. This may encompass quite a range of canopy covers from very scattered trees to considerable tree cover; however, canopy closure will lead to the loss of the bog elements. Therefore, an increase in tree seedling establishment and survival may indicate that the bog is likely to be degraded. In most cases, a change to closed canopy should be considered as evidence of deterioration.
An absence of trees could also be interpreted as loss of condition in some instances (assuming they were originally present). Loss of trees could be attributed to browsing pressure, wind throw, burning or water-logging; however, the loss of trees to bog through natural processes would not be considered as evidence of deterioration.
–Range of Tree Ages–
Determining the age of bog pines based on physical characteristics is not always simple, as some stunted pines are of considerable age. Hence, bog trees can be small and stunted or may be over head-height. However, recent research has found that there does appear to be a relationship between the age of bog-pines and their height, and also between tree age and diameter at breast height (DBH)–i.e. even older trees tend to have low height-to-diameter ratios. Most bog trees show signs of being limited by waterlogging and/or nutrient deficiency. They are also characterised by irregular branching (especially on small trees), sparse crowns, short needles, small (if any) cones and mature bark relative to the tree’s height. On some sites, no strong linear relationship was found between height and age, indicating that other factors account for much of the variation in tree size. However, based on this work, some broad generalisations may be possible. If trees are less than 1.5m in height and less than 5cm DBH, have smooth bark and are relatively lichen free, it might be assumed that they are less than 30 years old. Regeneration of bog pines may only occur sporadically following a succession of dry summers; therefore, evidence of regeneration may not be expected at any given time. However, in order to ensure some continuity of tree presence, there should at least be some trees that appear to be in this <30 year old cohort. It should also be expected that there are some older trees, either of greater height or diameter, and perhaps also some dead trees. Lichens tend to be more abundant on older pine trees; hence older specimens may have significant cover of crustose species.
–Micro-topography–
Most natural, undisturbed bog surfaces usually show distinctive fine-scale variation, with small, drier hummocks and wetter hollows related to growth of Sphagnum and other plants. Bog woodland sites might therefore be expected to contain some of the following. (These may be absent or reduced on cut-over or relatively recently formed bogs):
– Hummocks – mounds of Sphagnum which can be up to 1m high and 1-2m in diameter
– High ridges – characterised by a dominance of dwarf shrubs, particularly heather (Calluna vulgaris), often growing in a senescent Sphagnum carpet.
– Low ridges – distinguished from high ridges because they tend to be far less dominated by dwarf shrubs. They are characteristic of soft, undamaged mire systems, in which they constitute the major ridge component.
– Sphagnum hollows – Although free water is often not visible, the dense carpet of Sphagnum sits in an aqueous matrix and cannot support any great weight.
– Mud-bottom hollows – as above but limited in its moss cover and exhibiting a significant occurrence of higher plants.
–Bare Ground–
Bare patches in peatlands may be caused by peat cutting or erosion due to herbivore trampling, burning and/or considerable fluctuations in water levels. Deer wallows can create valuable habitats for invertebrates, and white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba) is sometimes found near such wallows. However, expanses of bare ground would generally be perceived as a negative indicator of condition. The target could be for a maximum acceptable area and/or proportion of the site, e.g. no more than 5% of site area and no individual area greater than 100sq m (0.01 ha).
–Water levels–
There are long-term natural cycles (decades) of drying and wetting related to natural variations in climate, which cause changes in the bog vegetation. However, the water table would be expected to be just below the surface for the majority of the year. A combination of the following factors can be used to assess if this appears to be the case:
– Sphagnum spp. frequent over the majority of the site
– there are no/few active drains
– peat cutting/extraction is absent
– there are no/few erosion channels which are not vegetated
– ground feels soft/wet underfoot
– As the water level can vary throughout the year, the vegetation is probably the best indicator of year round water levels. The overarching aim of the Wet Woods Restoration Project was to restore and enhance some of the most important areas of bog woodland and floodplain woodland in the United Kingdom and to remove or mitigate existing threats to these rare habitat types.
Objectives encompassed within the broader aim of the project are:
–to restore significant areas of wet wood habitat on or adjacent to sites that are candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSAC) through the reinstatement of more natural hydrological systems, restructuring of surrounding plantation forests, creation of buffer zones of native woodlands, and removal or control of exotic trees and shrubs
–to undertake scientific research into the history of bog woodland management and incorporate remote sensing data to inform restoration, management and monitoring plans for wet woods habitats
–to use the existing network of partner institutions to disseminate information gained throughout the project and encourage an integrated approach to the conservation of wet woods
–to support the development of partnerships between public agencies and private landowners.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: --Monadh Mor--
Restoration work at this site focused on an 82-hectare plantation planted on bog woodland north-east of and directly adjacent to the Monadh Mor cSAC. The plantation contained a mix of non-native conifers (principally Pinus contorta) with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) planted on the drier areas. The following specific targets were identified:
 -  Removal of all exotic and non-natural coniferous tree species from a total of 82 hectares, mostly adjacent to the cSAC.
 -  Removal of all trees planted on wet areas, with the exception of natural form Scots pines at the fringes
 -  Heavily thin remaining planted Scots pine
 -  Carry out hydrological works (i.e. drain blocking) over a total area of 104 hectares--22 hectares within the cSAC and 82 hectares adjacent to the cSAC.
 -  Overall target: the restoration of conditions favourable for the continuation and expansion of bog woodland habitat over a total area of 104 hectares.

For the forestry work, two main harvesting/felling methods were used. For trees of marketable size, felling and delimbing was done by harvester with extraction by forwarder. For trees of non-marketable size, felling was done by chainsaw, with felled trees cut into shorter lengths to assist brash breakdown. On the wettest, most sensitive areas, felled trees were carefully extracted either manually or by winch.

The first phase of the restoration programme began in February 1999 with the harvester/forwarder extraction method carried out by Forest Enterprise's (FE) own staff and machines. The harvester was particularly effective, as it had the ability to concentrate brash material, allowing the early recovery of a greater proportion of the vegetation. Damage through machine use was impressively minimal. As conditions got wetter into winter, machines with wider-than-normal tyres were used to reduce ground damage. It was necessary to move brash to protect the ground. Throughout the harvesting operation, watercourses were bridged using timber/brash bridges with piping to allow waterflow. Upon completion of the extraction, and following a detailed hydrological assessment, these bridging points were altered where necessary to become drain blocking dams.

The second phase of the restoration was carried out by a local contractor and began in early August 1999 with the first attempts at thinning the planted Scots pine on the drier knolls. LOPT discussions agreed on the following points of guidance for the forester:
 -  overall thinning intensity of c. 50%
 -  reduce uniformity by leaving some thicker clumps i.e. some areas 30%, some 70%
 -  sculpt straight edges
 -  lose rides and thinning racks
 -  generally aim to take out the straighter ""˜pole' trees and leave those with a more natural form.

For both phases of work, supervision was largely by FE, with LOPT meetings on-site as required to assess the work. By the 1st October 1999, a total of 36 hectares had been completed.

The third phase of the work was the ""˜fell to recycle' programme for Area 2. This again was carried out by a local contractor and concentrated on many of the more sensitive wetter areas where machines could not work.

The fourth phase of the work was the hydrological re-instatement (or drain blocking) work. The principal technique was machine-dug peat dams spaced approximately 10 metres apart. The digger (6 tonne, Hymac) constructed the dams by digging out saturated peat from the side or bottom of the drain and using that as the bulk of the dam. The turf scraped off to access the saturated peat was then used as a ""˜top' for the dam. In areas of shallow peat, dams had to be made out of the mineral soil. As much of the underlying soil at Monadh Mor is clay, the dams are thus far holding up very well; however, experience from previous LIFE projects has shown that dams of the more porous sandy soils can be much less effective. Overall, the drain blocking at Monadh Mor has worked well with, again, much emphasis on the importance of a skilled operator and close quality control. All the drain blocking work was completed by a local contractor, who also carried out some essential road/track improvements to facilitate access for monitoring and light recreation. 

The restoration work in the smaller area within the original cSAC (Area 1) was completed in January-February 2000 and amounted to a combination of tree removal and drain blocking. The tree removal was largely lodgepole pine and sitka spruce regeneration principally near the edge of a once afforested morainic peninsula which juts out on the southern boundary of the cSAC. As much of the regeneration was on very wet bog, there were problems in separating out the non-native lodgepole pine with the native Scots pine, as both species can look very similar in high water table conditions.

The final year was one of mainly care and maintenance with some tidying up completed and improvements made as necessary. One km of redundant internal fencing was removed to both improve the visual aspects and eliminate the potential threat of birdstrike. Another unplanned activity was the removal of the remains of 3 wrecked vehicles from the site.

--Inshriach--
The forest at Inshriach is owned by the Forestry Commission and largely comprises young lodgepole pine and Scots pine plantation, although there are significant remnants of bog woodland in varying condition. Restoration work originally focused on an area of mixed conifer and non-native regeneration which bordered a canalised and relatively fast flowing watercourse (Allt a Mharcaidh). The Inshriach LOPT agreed on the following prescriptions for the site:
 -  The removal of mixed conifers and non-native regeneration over an area of 40 hectares adjacent to the Allt a Mharcaidh
 -  The heavy thinning of planted Scots pine 
 -  The blocking of key drains within this area 

The restoration programme began in July 1999 with the harvester/forwarder extraction method. Larger trees of marketable size were felled by a mechanical harvester and extracted by a forwarder machine. Progress was excellent with completion of the 20 hectare contract by the end of August 1999. The harvester was particularly effective as it had an ability to concentrate brash material allowing the early recovery of a greater proportion of the vegetation. Damage through machine use was impressively minimal although this was helped by a good dry spell of weather. Throughout the harvesting operation, watercourses were bridged using timber/brash bridges with piping to allow waterflow. As with the Monadh Mor site, upon completion of the extraction, these bridging points were altered where necessary to become drain blocking dams. Areas of pure planted Scots pine on the drier morainic deposits were retained, but thinned to a more natural structure to increase the chances of recovery of the ground vegetation.

The second phase of the work at Inshriach was carried out in January 2000 and focused on the more waterlogged areas where regenerated lodgepole pine was removed by chainsaw and cross-cut to encourage rapid natural decay. Both phases of felling work were undertaken by a local contractor and completed ahead of schedule and within budget.

Following tree removal, the hydrological reinstatement work was carried out in May 2000. During the final year of the project a number of small areas totalling 0.5 ha were tidied up with the removal of missed individual trees. In the spring of 2001, an estimated 80% of the brash over the entire area was raked into approximately 200 piles located on mineral soils. The majority of these were burnt during the early winter of 2001, but some will were left as controls to see whether they will be beneficial to invertebrates or provide cover for birds and mammals.

--Abernethy--
As the most complex of the project sites, Abernethy is divided into four management units: Mondhuie, North Abernethy, Dell Wood and Garten Wood.

Tree felling at Mondhuie started in early July 1998 on a plantation of lodgepole pine, and by November 1998, 21.7 ha had been felled. Progress was slow due to the shape and form of the trees, many of which had several main stems. Consequently, felling was done by hand with chainsaws rather than by the cheaper harvester/forwarder method. The second phase began in November 1998 with a harvester/forwarder contract to extract the more marketable timber. This was completed by February 1999 and increased the felled area by another 24 ha. The third phase of tree felling was carried out between August 1999 and March 2000 over an additional area of 24 ha. A fourth felling phase at Mondhuie began in February 2000 using a harvester/forwarder contract. This was a no-cost operation as the extracted timber covered the cost of the machines involved in carrying out the work. An area of 18.5 ha was cleared by April 2000. The final stage at Mondhuie involved felling by hand over approximately 14.1 ha and was completed by February 2001.

The large scale of felling at this site meant that a considerable area was covered by brash. Given the scale of the removal task it was decided to leave the brash on site and compare the development of the area with other areas outwith Mondhuie where brash removal (mainly by burning on site) has taken place.

Drain blocking at Mondhuie commenced in March 1999 with the damming of the two main drainage systems on the south side of the site. The principal technique involved machine-dug peat dams spaced approximately 10 metres apart. A 6-tonne Hymac digger was employed to dig out saturated peat from the side or bottom of the drain for use in construction of the bulk of the dam. The vegetation scraped off the surface of the peat was then used as a top for the dam.

In November 2000, 14 peat dams collapsed following several days of very heavy rain. Immediate remedial work involved the removal of peat debris in drains on the site and clearing two culverts running under the adjacent public road. The collapse was considered a result of the unsuitability of peat dams to control such large volumes of water. However, the event exacerbated the concerns of a neighbouring tenant farmer and landowner who held the restoration work responsible for increased wetting of their land. The Scottish Agricultural College was therefore contracted to review the impact of the restoration work on local hydrology. Their report showed that although, as expected, tree felling had increased the water run-off, the main problems experienced on the adjacent land were a result of recent increased rainfall and lack of maintenance of field drains. Consequently, field drains adjacent to the site were cleared and three metal pile dams were constructed in the main drain where the collapse had occurred. An additional fourth metal pile dam was installed in March 2002 to consolidate the earlier work.

Most of the work in North Abernethy involved drain blocking, focusing on areas where earlier restoration had been carried out. Initially there was not thought to be any need for habitat restoration at North Abernethy, but subsequent investigation highlighted the additional need for some tree removal. Local contractors removed planted Scots pine from an area of 1.6 ha of ploughed and planted peatland in August 1999, along with 8.7 ha of dense, naturally regenerated Scots pine on drained peatland. A total of 10.3 ha were therefore restored by tree removal. 

The first phase of drain blocking at North Abernethy started in March 1999 as a continuation of the work at Mondhuie. The work included two techniques--complete filling of drains in two areas and the installation of peat dams at intervals along drains at two other sites. In all, 13.6 ha of peatland was restored by the end of the contract. The second phase of restoration work revisited areas where earlier attempts at re-wetting had not achieved their objectives and was carried out in the autumn of 1999. This work involved filling in the plough lines using two 6-tonne Hymac diggers in a technique not before employed at Abernethy. Initial results in these areas have been very encouraging. This phase of the work resulted in the restoration of 21.5 ha of wetland.

Dell Wood is part of the Abernethy Dell Wood National Nature Reserve, of which some 266 ha are owned and managed by Scottish Natural Heritage, with another 108 ha leased from the RSPB. It contains extensive areas of bog woodland, many of which have been subject to the effects of drainage and forestry. An area to the south of Nethy Bridge was drained and planted with lodgepole pine in the 1970s, with approximately 5 ha planted on peatland. These 5 ha were felled (as part of a larger felling exercise designed to benefit Caledonian pinewood) in September and October 1999, after consultation with the local community of Nethy Bridge who make use of the area for light recreation. There was no adverse reaction to the project proposals. As a demonstration of an alternative brash disposal technique, it was decided that rather than being left on the site, the brash should be gathered into large heaps and later burned. Burning began in November 2000 and continued when weather and ground conditions allowed, although these operations were later delayed as a result of foot and mouth restrictions imposed in February 2001. SNH labour was used for the brash burning, augmented by contractors. Although no dams were built, the felled timber was used to infill the drains and this, in conjunction with the tree removal, has resulted in the area becoming re-wetted.

The more intact 'drained only' part of the Dell Wood bog woodland was targeted in August-September 2001, with a contractor employed to install 30 hand-built dams. This has resulted in drains being blocked over an area of approximately 14 ha.

Most of the project's work at Garten Wood was carried out in November and December of 1999 over an area of approximately 25.4 ha. Plastic piling material was used to construct dams by hand in areas where drain blocking had not previously taken place. In areas of consolidation, new dams were constructed next to the originals, using Scots pine logs with locally dug peat infill and vegetated tops. This work was also carried out by hand to prevent excessive damage to the bog by machinery.

--Pitmaduthy--
At the outset of the project, there were two main threats perceived to the bog woodland at Pitmaduthy Moss. The site was considered to be under a degree of threat of drying out from the adjacent plantation of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and this plantation also appeared to be a seed source for invasion of the site. 

Fertiliser spray drift and run-off from agricultural land directly adjacent to the northern margin of the site was thought to be causing nutrient enrichment. It was believed such enrichment could significantly increase the growth of existing trees, encourage tree regeneration and alter the vegetation structure typical of nutrient-poor bog woodlands.

The hydrological survey of the site carried out in June and July of 1999 concluded that there was already a healthy semi-native pinewood buffer zone between the plantation and the bog and there was no evidence of any negative effect. Thus, it was advised that tree removal should not be an objective on this site.

--Conon Islands--
The management targets for this site were:
 -  The restoration of 27 ha of alluvial woodland by the felling of invasive sycamore (Acer psuedoplatanus) and the removal of the exotic shrub Physocarpus opulifolus 
 -  The upgrading of 200 metres of the River Conon Walk footpath in order to divert visitors away from sensitive areas of the site 
 -  The fencing of areas where stock access was thought to be causing damage to the alluvial woodland 

The main work of the restoration project involved the felling and cutting of exotic species, which was carried out by a combination of manual cutting, mechanical flailing, and in some cases, actually pulling up plants by hand. Stumps were treated with a systemic herbicide as appropriate. It was accepted that complete eradication of the target species was not a realistic objective, especially given the dynamic nature of the floodplain woodland habitat. However, it is envisaged that ongoing control requirements would be built into the development of a management stategy for the Conon.

The first stage of restoration work was completed in June 2000 with the felling of sycamore from 3 ha in the Kildun Farm area of the site. This was part of a Woodland Grant Scheme, which also included the maintenance of existing stock fencing and the improvement of a public footpath to enable light access to continue. This area was revisited in 2001 when the Physocarpus was cut, and again in 2002, when the regrowth was sprayed. Work on the clearance of exotic trees within Garrie Island began in autumn 2000, and by May 2001, approximately 5.9 ha had been cleared of sycamore. The Physocarpus was then cut and, as above, the regrowth sprayed in 2002. Further upstream, a strip of 8.3 ha dominated by sycamore and rhododendron was cleared and the regrowth also treated in 2002. All restoration work at Conon Islands was undertaken by local contractors. In total an area of just over 17 ha was restored to allow for the development of natural alluvial woodlands. Although this is slightly less than the amended target, it does represent a significant piece of work in this delicate ecosystem. Work in this potentially very wet environment can mean that windows of opportunity for work are restricted, particularly in wet winters such as occurred in 2001/2002.

--Lower River Spey--
The Lower River Spey was not part of the original project bid, but as a result of a predicted project underspend, a bid was submitted in March 2001 to continue with work already undertaken within the cSAC. The Culriach Woods section of the floodplain woodland at this site has been adversely affected by the planting of conifers in the 1950s. Forest Enterprise had completed some conifer removal prior to the start of the Project but since this time there had been significant regrowth of exotic broadleaved trees, principally sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus). Other non-native shrubs and plants are also present. On disturbed ground, these exotics can rapidly displace natural floodplain communities if native species are not quickly established. The objectives for this site therefore concentrate on assisting the regeneration of native species, as follows:
 -  The removal of remaining brash to promote the regeneration of floodplain woodland 
 -  The treatment with an appropriate herbicide of sycamore stumps where re-growth is occurring
 -  Plantation of native floodplain trees with appropriate fencing to assist regeneration 
 -  Provision of interpretative boards and signs to describe the ongoing work and its purpose to walkers using the Speyside Way path adjacent to the restoration area.

Restoration work at Lower River Spey was undertaken by Forest Enterprise staff. Initially, brash from previous felling was gathered into heaps and then taken off site. The next step involved the use of chainsaws to fell sycamore. Treatment of the stumps was also carried out by hand, with herbicide injected into the fresh stumps. A mixture of native tree species was planted in the areas where felling had taken place, and this was fenced to prevent browsing of the young trees by deer. Given that the River Spey is prone to flooding within this site, it is important to work when weather conditions allow, and therefore, a season's work had already been completed before approval of the bid for this site was given in October 2001. Thus, no claim for management work was submitted as part of the project costings. As owners, Forest Enterprise will continue to undertake sympathetic management of this floodplain woodland area. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Monadh Mor 
 -  Hydrological integrity restored over 103.3 ha of the restoration area. 
 -  Felling of non-native conifers and thinning of plantation Scots pine over a total area of 142.6 ha. 
 -  Removal of 1 km of redundant fencing from the site to improve visual aspects and reduce the potential for birdstrike. 
 -  Two new gates provided to allow access for visitors on foot or bicycle and the addition of waymarkers on the route through the restored areas. 
 -  Two interpretation panels erected on site. 
 -  Guided tours given to various groups including the Inverness Botany Group and junior rangers (12-17 years old) from various country parks in Glasgow. 

Inshriach
 -  Habitat and hydrology on over 52 ha have been restored to a condition that will allow bog woodland to develop naturally within a natural pinewood on this site. This forms part of a larger 146-ha area which was submitted to the European Commission on 29 January 2001 as a mixture of bog woodland and Caledonian Forest. 
 -  Two interpretative panels have been installed. 
 -  Guided site visits were given by Forest Enterprise staff to a number of groups including the Keilder LIFE bog restoration project, Centre for Ecology & Hydrology staff, and participants of the end-of-project conference. 

Abernethy
 -  Drains blocked over a total of 207.5 ha 
 -  Trees removed from an area of 116.9 ha 
 -  Two new information panels installed at Mondhuie on the Speyside Way long-distance footpath. These explained the need for tree removal and drain blocking and highlighted the benefits to wildlife 
 -  Guided visits undertaken to various areas within Abernethy for a number of parties, including Prince Charles, the Native Woodland Habitat Action Plan group, the Border Mires LIFE team and delegates from the Final Conference 

Canon Islands
 -  Restoration of floodplain woodland over an area of 17.2 ha. 
 -  Provision of interpretation boards and signage at key points, describing the value of the habitat and the aims of the restoration work. 
 -  Completion of a historical survey of the River Conon. This survey looked at three main issues that could alter river hydrology: deforestation, hydroelectric dam construction, and construction of floodbanks and installation of field drainage systems. The report considers management options which relate to local impacts and will inform the development of a stategy for the area. 
 -  Completion of a report on the Residual Alluvial Woodlands of the River Conon. This report provided an overall description of the present state of the riparian habitat mosaics and the dynamics of the river and its floodplain, with the ultimate aim of determining activities which will maximise the conservation value of the alluvial woodlands in this location. 

Lower River Spey 
 -  Installation of two interpretation panels adjacent to the site on the long-distance Speyside Way footpath. 
 -  Approximately 20 ha of restored floodplain woodland on the Lower River Spey candidate SAC (N.B. This work was not funded by the LIFE Project) Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The early indications are that bog woodland aspects of the project have been particularly successful in spite of early complications. These illustrated the problems associated with developing programmes such as this. Parts of the areas that have been restored were very degraded, and it was difficult to accurately assess before the work began what the situation would be on the ground with respect to its hydrological state. Also, it was difficult to assess the ability of machines to carry out the work, and in many cases (e.g. Mondhuie), much of the work had to be done manually. This is much more expensive and time consuming than machine felling. More accurate preliminary mapping would have reduced the uncertainties, and certainly the experience of this project, and the recent improvement in digital mapping techniques, will mean that any future work will be based on a more accurate understanding of the problem.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The main measurable socio-economic benefit that this project has brought has been the work that has been carried out by local contractors. All of the project locations can be considered economically vulnerable, where opportunities for rural employment are often at a premium. Although much of the work is one off, the project has been quite labour intensive in many instances (as shown by the need to hand-fell 63 ha at Mondhuie) and has provided opportunities for local contractors during this period. Furthermore, the novel nature of the work has allowed local contractors to develop new skills which will prove to be useful as they seek new contracts. It also benefits the sites directly, as there is now an experienced group of contractors who are used the different requirements of conservation, as opposed to economically-led management.
As a result of the project, there are now no major areas within the sites that will require further significant work. All will be monitored as part of SNH’s Site Condition Monitoring (SCM) programme, and some will be subject to more specific local monitoring to measure success and progress, and also to determine whether any remedial work is required. Owing to project efforts, an additional 214.3 ha of bog woodland habitat was submitted to the EC as additions to the Monadh Mor and Cairngorm cSAC on 29 January 2001. The area associated with the restoration of the Conon is considerably less; however, it has nevertheless been significant and considerably more than originally planned. The problems associated with the Conon are more or less restricted to the presence of exotic species, as the component parts of the cSAC are located on areas close to the River Conon where the hydrological regime is less altered than areas back from the river. The presence of exotics within the rest of the catchment will mean that there is a continuing need to monitor the site and take remedial action as necessary. However, because of the major work that has been achieved by the project, the need for further work will be considerably reduced. The developing Conon strategy already appears to be paying dividends. The work that has been undertaken has raised the profile of the conservation issues and resulted in new proposals being brought forward. The suggested restoration of residual alluvial woodland and the development of a new salmon spawning redd along the old river channel on Dunglass Island, for example, is the direct result of discussions about the Conon Strategy. An approach from a land manager about the control of Himalayan Balsam on the lower Conon has also been inspired by the work undertaken as part of the project to deal with rhododendron and Physocarpus. Both of these possible future projects show a desire to become involved in partnership working to produce results on the ground.
The Wet Woods Project has built upon and strengthened working relationships that have been developed among members of the Caledonian Partnership over a number of years of involvement with LIFE Projects. This close liaison will be invaluable as other LIFE Projects, such as the Capercaillie Project, and other such joint working opportunities arise. Approximately 95% of the project area lies within land owned by Forest Enterprise, Scottish Natural Heritage or the RSPB and is therefore covered by existing commitments to manage these areas for long-term nature conservation. All of the other areas are also underpinned by domestic legislation, as they are parts of larger Sites of Special Scientific Interest and will therefore be afforded the protection provided by this designation. All of the sites will be monitored as part of SNH’s Site Condition Monitoring programme and some (e.g. Mondhuie) will be subject to more intensive surveying. Although at this stage there are not thought to be any outstanding issues, it is felt that there are sufficient systems in place to ensure that any work identified as a result of monitoring will be undertaken. The move from merely preventing deterioration of the cSAC habitats to their enhancement and expansion will take several woodland cycles. The management of alien exotics is also a long-term project. Due to their invasive nature, some species may need control over several years or may re-invade following initial eradication. The control of these species will therefore have to continue for several years beyond the life of the project and will need the support of public funding in the form of SFGS, grants and agri-environment schemes.
The development of sustainable management practices for the floodplain woodland of the River Conon is likely to take several years. Although the cSAC is limited to the series of wooded islands towards the mouth of the river, the extent and distribution of alluvial woodland is dependent on the dynamics of the river system as a whole. Many of the floodplain sites have been protected from inundation by embankments and bunds to allow for agriculture and grazing, and the natural dynamics of the river have been inhibited along many stretches. Thus, there is a need to restore the context in which these woods originally developed, which will require consideration of land use and woodland communities outside the designated boundaries. It is therefore considered essential for the future management of the cSAC to develop an integrated management plan for the wider river system which will, as far as possible, allow the natural hydrology to be restored. The dissemination of SNH’s Conon Strategy to the other stakeholders and the possible formation of a management group over the next two years is the start of the process. "

En respuesta a estas circunstancias, una estrategia de restauración que se puede adoptar es utilizar plantas “nodrizas” para mejorar la tasa de reclutamiento de especies colonizadoras y facilitar la sucesión natural mediante el aporte de nutrientes al suelo y la protección de nuevos propágulos. Este estudio fue realizado con el fin de evaluar el efecto de arbustos nativos micorrizados como plantas nodrizas y para investigar la influencia de las micorrizas en la supervivencia y el crecimiento de los mismos. Aparte de un tratamiento control, se aplicaron tratamientos que combinaban suelos esterilizados, suelos inoculados con hongos micorrizógenos y suelos inoculados y tratados con fertilizante. Se encontró que el tratamiento más efectivo fue el que utilizó un inóculo proveniente de las mismas condiciones ecológicas que la planta junto con una dosis extra de fertilizante. Los resultados de este estudio tienen implicaciones amplias para la rehabilitación de áreas extensas de La Gran Sabana dónde otras técnicas de restauración no han sido exitosas.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Con motivo de la construcción de una carretera asfaltada que une al Km 88 con Santa Elena de Uairén (Troncal 10) atravesando La Gran Sabana, se efectuaron numerosas perturbaciones o préstamos donde se removió totalmente el horizonte orgánico del suelo. Los propágulos de las micorrizas arbusculares (MA) generalmente se encuentran concentrados en los primeros centímetros del suelo (Schwab y Reeves, 1981; Bellgard, 1993). Debido a ello, cuando se produce una perturbación severa en la que el suelo es removido parcialmente (como pasó en este caso), ocurre una drástica disminución de los propágulos de MA. En consecuecia, las plantas que generalmente invaden estas áreas no forman micorrizas (plantas no micótrofas) (Miller, 1979; Reeves et al., 1979, Janos, 1996). Si la comunidad que se establece en el sitio está constituida fundamentalmente por plantas no micótrofas y el reingreso de los propágulos de MA es muy lento, el proceso sucesional puede estancarse y la recuperación del área dañada puede resultar seriamente obstaculizada, debido a que las plantas que constituyen los ecosistemas maduros generalmente requieren de micorrizas para su adecuado funcionamiento (micótrofas obligadas; Janos, 1996; Brundrett, 1991). Por lo tanto, si la perturbación causa la pérdida de los propágulos de micorrizas, la recuperación de las áreas degradadas sólo será posible si se reintroducen los mismos. Si se toman en cuenta las condiciones edáficas de la Gran Sabana, las cuales se caracterizan por presentar suelos naturalmente ácidos y extremadamente pobres en nutrientes, la presencia de micorrizas arbusculares (MA) parece imprescindible para el establecimiento y crecimiento de las plantas (Cuenca et al., 1998a).
Las micorrizas son asociaciones simbióticas mutualistas que se establecen entre las raíces de la mayoría de las plantas y algunos hongos. Se sabe que las micorrizas ejercen numerosos efectos beneficiosos sobre las plantas, entre los cuales la mayor absorción de fósforo por parte de las plantas micorrizadas, es la que ha sido más estudiada. También la presencia de esta simbiosis produce un incremento en la captación de otros elementos poco móviles en el suelo como son: Cu, Zn, NH 4 + , (Smith y Read, 1997). Además se sabe que las micorrizas confieren a las plantas que las poseen una mayor protección contra patógenos, mejoran la estructura del suelo y el balance hídrico (Barea et al., 1991). Utilizar arbustos nativos de La Gran Sabana, provenientes de estacas o de semillas, previamente micorrizados, para recuperar las áreas degradadas y evaluar su efecto en el reclutamiento de otras especies nativas de La Gran Sabana.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Se seleccionó la especie Clusia pusilla, nativa de los arbustales de La Gran Sabana (Huber, 1994), por su alto porcentaje de germinación, tolerancia a la alta irradiación y facilidad para reproducirse por estacas.

El inóculo de Glomus manihotis utilizado en este trabajo provino del Centro Internacional de Agronomía Tropical (CIAT) de Cali, Colombia. El inóculo de sabana fue aislado de la sabana de los alrededores de la Estación Científica Parupa (ECP) y el inóculo de arbustal fue aislado de un arbustal cercano a Iboribó en La Gran Sabana. El inóculo de sabana estaba dominado por una Scutellospora hialina, además de tres especies de Glomus presentes en una proporción muy baja, ninguno de los cuales pudo ser identificado. El inóculo de arbustal estaba dominado por una especie de Glomus marrón ovoide de identidad desconocida, muy común en los suelos ácidos de Venezuela, además de Acaulospora scrobiculata y una Entrophospora que parece ser una especie aún no reconocida, entre otras. Para la reproducción de los inóculos en la ECP, se utilizaron cestas plásticas de aproximadamente 41 litros de capacidad, las cuales se llenaron con un sustrato previamente esterilizado que consistió en dos partes de suelo orgánico, 1 parte de suelo de la sabana de los alrededores de la ECP y arena cuarcítica (1/8 v/v). 

El ensayo constó de una etapa inicial que se efectuó en el vivero de la Estación Científica de Parupa (ECP) en La Gran Sabana y la cual se extendió por 4 meses. Actividades Previas. Antes de proceder a establecer el ensayo, las estacas de C. pusilla se colocaron en agua destilada y las semillas en arena estéril. A los dos meses, cuando la mayoría de las estacas habían producido raíces y las plántulas provenientes de la semilla habían desplegado completamente los cotiledones, se sembraron en bolsas plásticas de 5kg de capacidad que contenían suelo previamente tratado según se describe más adelante. El suelo utilizado en este ensayo fue el de las sabanas que rodean a la ECP y fue seleccionado debido a que las áreas degradadas a las cuales van dirigidas las plantas son fundamentalmente sabanas. Dicho suelo fue esterilizado con basamid a la dosis recomendada. Se hizo una evaluación rápida del potencial micorrízico de los distintos inóculos basada en el número de esporas, capacidad para promover el crecimiento y la micorrización de las plantas hospederas y el porcentaje de colonización micorrízica que produjeron en dichas plantas. Esa evaluación mostró que los inóculos seleccionados tenían potenciales micorrízicos diferentes, por lo que se intentó ajustar la cantidad de inóculo aplicado de acuerdo a ello, con el fin de tratar de compensar estas diferencias.

De cada tratamiento se prepararon 12 bolsas para un total de 192 bolsas en todo el ensayo. Tanto las plántulas provenientes de semillas como las estacas fueron sometidas a los siguientes tratamientos: 

C: Suelo esterilizado. 

P: Suelo esterilizado fertilizado con 150kg/ha de Superfosfato triple (SPT). 

M1: Suelo esterilizado inoculado con Glomus manihotis en la dosis de 50g de inóculo/planta. 

M2: Suelo esterilizado inoculado con un cultivo mixto de hongos micorrizógenos (HMA) proveniente de una sabana en la dosis de 50g/planta 

M3: Suelo esterilizado inoculado con un cultivo mixto de HMA proveniente de un arbustal en la dosis de 70g/planta. 

M1+P: Suelo esterilizado inoculado con G. manihotis en la dosis de 50g/planta y fertilizado con 150kg/ha de SPT. 

M2+P: Suelo esterilizado inoculado con HMA de sabana en la dosis de 50g/planta y fertilizado con 150kg/ha de SPT. 

M3+P: Suelo esterilizado inoculado con HMA de arbustal en la dosis de 70g/planta y fertilizado con 150kg/ha de SPT. 

Todos los tratamientos recibieron cada 15 días durante la fase de vivero una solución nutritiva que contenía N, K y Mg (20, 20 y 10mg/planta). A los tratamientos control (C y P) se les agregó una mezcla de estos tres inóculos previamente esterilizados con radiaciones gamma (8kGy) en el Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas. 

Después de sembrar todas las plantas se reintrodujeron los microorganismos del suelo distintos a los hongos micorrizógenos (HMA), para lo cual se mezcló el suelo de sabana sin esterilizar con agua destilada (1kg de suelo/litro) y posteriormente se lo diluyó al 5%. Se agregaron 40ml de esta solución a cada bolsa.

Después del establecimiento del ensayo en el vivero de la ECP se procedió a transplantarlo al campo. Antes del transplante se hizo una evaluación de la altura y la supervivencia de las plantas.

Las plantas, 10 de cada tratamiento, se transplantaron siguiendo un diseño al azar y quedaron en el campo separadas entre sí por una distancia de 1m por cada lado. A los 11 meses de haber establecido el ensayo en el campo, se cosecharon tres plantas de cada tratamiento, a las cuales se les determinó el peso seco del vástago después de secar el material durante 72 horas en una estufa a 60Â°C. De los sistemas radicales se tomó una muestra representativa, la cual se tiñó en el laboratorio con azul de tripán, siguiendo la metodología de Phillips y Hayman (1970). La presencia de micorrizas y de arbúsculos se evaluó siguiendo el método de Mc Gonigle et al. (1990). 

Se evaluó la supervivencia y la altura de las plantas a los 6.5, 11, 18 y 21 meses después del transplante. Adicionalmente, se hizo el seguimiento del ingreso de plántulas nativas alrededor de cada planta nodriza (reclutamiento), para ello las plántulas reclutadas se marcaron y enumeraron. A los 21 meses se tomaron muestras botánicas de las mismas para proceder a la identificación por parte de los especialistas y se evaluó la presencia o ausencia de MA, para lo cual las raicillas de las distintas especies se tiñeron con azul de tripán (Phillips y Hayman, 1970) y se examinaron bajo el microscopio estereoscópico con el fin de detectar la presencia de alguna de las estructuras diagnósticas de las MA. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Los datos de supervivencia de las plántulas provenientes de semillas, después de permanecer 4 meses en el vivero de la ECP indican una baja mortalidad en todos los casos. Esto se cumplió tanto para las plántulas provenientes de semillas como para las estacas. No pareció haber ninguna relación obvia entre la presencia o no de micorrizas y la mortalidad de las plantas en esta fase. 

Los datos de altura muestran que el control no micorrizado creció significativamente menos que todos los demás tratamientos. Las plantas micorrizadas crecieron de manera similar al tratamiento fertilizado con 150kg/ha de SPT (P). En los tratamientos en los que se combinó la fertilización con SPT con la inoculación con HMA, los resultados más favorables en cuanto a altura los presentaron los tratamientos M2+P y M3+P, los cuales no solo produjeron un incremento estadísticamente mayor que los tratamientos donde se aplicaron los inóculos solos (M2 y M3), sino también mayor que el tratamiento fertilizado con SPT (P). En contraste, la combinación de G. manihotis con el fertilizante (M1+P), no produjo un efecto distinguible ni de M1 sólo, ni de P.

Los datos de supervivencia de las plántulas de C. pusilla once meses después de haber sido transplantadas al campo, muestran una tendencia de M2 y M3 a tener una mayor mortalidad, incluso mayor que C. En contraste, en el tratamiento donde se aplicó el inóculo de G. manihotis solo o junto con el fertilizante, no se produjo la muerte de ninguna plántula, lo mismo que en el  tratamiento M3+P. Tanto en el tratamiento control como en el M2+P la supervivencia fue menor que cuando se aplicó el fertilizante solo (P).

Los datos de altura muestran diferencias entre el control y los demás tratamientos mucho más marcadas que las que se observaron al final de la etapa de vivero. Todos los tratamientos micorrizados se distinguieron significativamente del control. Sin embargo, los datos muestran también una importante respuesta al fertilizante, la cual es mayor en todos los casos que el efecto causado por las micorrizas cuando los inóculos se aplicaron solos. Cuando el fertilizante se aplicó junto con los distintos inóculos se obtuvo una respuesta que tampoco difirió de la causada por el fertilizante solo salvo para el tratamiento M1+P. 

El peso seco del vástago muestra tendencias similares a las de la altura pero en este caso los tratamientos M2 y M3 no se distinguieron del control no micorrizado aunque M1 sí. Por otra parte, el efecto de los tratamientos M1+P y M3+P resultó igual al del P pero no lograron superarlo estadísticamente y M2+P produjo un efecto menor al del tratamiento P. 

Los datos de colonización micorrízica de las plántulas indican que las plantas del tratamiento fertilizado (P) estaban contaminadas con MA e incluso tenían arbúsculos. De hecho, el % de arbúsculos de los tratamientos M2, M2+P y M3+P no se distinguió estadísticamente de los producidos por la contaminación del tratamiento P. Por su parte, las plantas de los tratamientos inoculados presentaron porcentajes de micorrización bastante altos. En el control (C) también se evidenció una contaminación. 

En general la mortalidad de las estacas de C. pusilla después de once meses en el campo fue muy baja para todos los tratamientos. Las estacas, como era previsible, eran sustancialmente más altas a esta altura del experimento que las plántulas provenientes de semilla. En cuanto a la altura, los tratamientos M1+P y M3+P resultaron estadísticamente diferentes del control (C) y del tratamiento fertilizado (P). Sin embargo, cuando se analiza el peso seco del vástago, sólo las estacas del tratamiento M3+P se distinguen estadísticamente del control fertilizado P. 

Los datos de colonización micorrízica de las estacas muestran también en este caso una contaminación en el tratamiento P, aunque con muy pocos arbúsculos. En general los tratamientos inoculados alcanzaron valores de colonización micorrízica bastante altos. El tratamiento M1 se destaca por un porcentaje de arbúsculos significativamente mayor que el de M3. 

En cuanto a los datos de reclutamiento de plantas nativas de La Gran Sabana alrededor de las plántulas de C. pusilla utilizadas como plantas nodrizas, los resultados obtenidos después de 21 meses de iniciado el experimento fueron los siguientes. Aunque el número de plantas reclutadas en los tratamientos control y M2 muestra un máximo 11 meses después del transplante de las plantas nodrizas al campo, estas diferencias no se mantuvieron en el tiempo y las diferencias entre los tratamientos no resultaron estadísticamente significativas. 

En contraste, cuando se utilizaron las estacas como plantas nodrizas, se obtuvo una tendencia sigmoide en la curva del tratamiento M1+P, destacándose significativamente del control y de los tratamientos M3 y M2, los cuales arrojaron los valores más bajos de número promedio de plantas reclutadas. 

Cuando se analizan en detalle las plantas reclutadas en cada caso, se observa: La frecuencia de ingreso a los distintos tratamientos cuando se utilizaron las plántulas como nodrizas es muy baja. El que la ""isla de fertilidad"" estuviese micorrizada o nó, no pareció influir ni en la frecuencia de ingreso de las especies ni en la micorrización o no de las plantas colonizadoras. En efecto, de las tres especies de plantas que colonizaron el tratamiento control, dos presentaron colonización micorrízica y sólo en un caso (Scleria cyperina) la planta se encontró sin micorrizas. En contraste, en el tratamiento M2, una de las especies reclutadas, la gramínea Panicum cf micranthum, no estaba micorrizada, a pesar de la oferta de inóculo presente en su sitio de crecimiento. 

En contraste, cuando se usaron las estacas de C. pusilla como plantas nodrizas, se obtuvo una mayor diversidad de especies colonizadoras, aunque hubo una considerable dominancia de la especie Sauvagesia cf erecta. Resulta notable el hecho de que en este caso el reclutamiento se dio principalmente en los tratamientos micorrizados. 

Tampoco se encontró una relación entre la presencia de MA en las plantas nodrizas y la micorrización de las plantas reclutadas. Sólo cinco de las plantas colonizadoras resultaron estar libres de micorrizas y todas aparecieron en tratamientos micorrizados: Sauvagesia cf erecta en el tratamiento M1, Echinolaena inflexa en el tratamiento M1+P y Rhynchospora cf conata en el tratamiento M1. Por otra parte, las colonizadoras reclutadas en el tratamiento C (una sola) y en el tratamiento P (tres) estaban micorrizadas. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Los resultados de la cosecha realizada once meses después de establecido el ensayo en el campo, mostraron la ausencia de un efecto positivo por encima del control, cuando se aplicaron los tratamientos M2 y M3 sin una dosis adicional de P. Ello implica que en este caso, el efecto beneficioso de las micorrizas no pudo ser compensado por el costo en carbohidratos que implica la simbiosis, debido probablemente a la baja disponibilidad del P en el suelo. Resultados similares han sido encontrados en condiciones de invernadero y previamente ha sido reportado en condiciones de campo en un experimento realizado en un área degradada de La Gran Sabana, similar a la utilizada en este trabajo. Brachiaria decumbens presentó un escaso crecimiento (similar al control) cuando se inoculó con HMA y se sembró directamente en el suelo del área degradada sin una dosis adicional de fósforo (Cuenca et al., 1998a). 

No resulta obvia la explicación del escaso funcionamiento del inóculo de arbustal en ausencia de una dosis adicional de P, siendo que como sabemos, los suelos de La Gran Sabana, son muy deficitarios en nutrientes (Dezzeo y FÁ¶lster, 1994). Estos resultados podrían llevar a pensar que en condiciones naturales C. pusilla está limitada por nutrientes aunque esté micorrizada y puede incluso suceder que se de una depresión del crecimiento (como la observada en este experimento) causada por el hongo, en cuyo caso las MA estarían comportándose como parásitas. Parece poco probable que esto suceda en condiciones naturales. De hecho, en el suelo del arbustal que es donde C. pusilla normalmente vive, se encuentra micorrizada por un inóculo muy similar al utilizado en el tratamiento M3 y los niveles de materia orgánica son muy elevados (hasta 20%) (Cuenca et al., 1998b). Se podría especular que en condiciones naturales las plantas micorrizadas tienen acceso a esas fuentes de P orgánico, las cuales les permiten compensar los costos de la simbiosis. 

En efecto, aunque ha sido un tema sumamente polémico el de si las micorrizas arbusculares son capaces o no de utilizar fuentes orgánicas de fósforo(Bolan, 1991), recientemente Koide y Kabir (2000), han demostrado que en ausencia de bacterias asociadas, el micelio externo de las MA es capaz de solubilizar y utilizar compuestos orgánicos de P. Por lo tanto, la hipótesis propuesta parecería factible.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Acelerar el proceso de regeneración natural de estas áreas degradadas es un objetivo muy deseable dada la importancia de La Gran Sabana como parte de la cuenca del río Caroní, el cual alimenta a la represa del Guri de la que depende más del 60% de la energía hidroeléctrica de Venezuela.
Los resultados presentados indican claramente que C. pusilla es una especie muy dependiente de las micorrizas, como quedó evidenciado por el escaso crecimiento que se observó en las plantas del control, en concordancia con la experiencia previa que se posee para otras especies de Clusia (Cuenca et al., 2001; Cáceres y Cuenca, 1996).
Al final de la etapa de vivero, las micorrizas causaron un efecto en el crecimiento de C. pusilla equivalente a 150kg/ha de superfosfato triple, y dicho efecto se potenció al aplicar simultáneamente un inóculo proveniente de las mismas condiciones ecológicas que la planta junto con una dosis extra de fertilizante. Esto revela que los suelos de la sabana de los alrededores de la ECP son limitantes en P para el crecimiento de C. pusilla. De hecho, cuando se estudia la presencia de plantas colonizadoras en las áreas degradadas de La Gran Sabana, las cuales, se sabe, son muy bajas en propágulos de MA, nunca se encuentra a esta especie creciendo espontáneamente (Rosales et al., 1997).
En relación al objetivo fundamental de este trabajo, los resultados del reclutamiento de plantas nativas de La Gran Sabana indican que, tal como se había supuesto inicialmente, las plantas de C. pusilla provenientes de estacas, al tener mayor porte y biomasa, crearon una mayor turbulencia del viento el cual favoreció el reclutamiento de semillas de otras plantas nativas de La Gran Sabana. El tamaño que tenían las plantas de C. pusilla provenientes de semilla a los 21 meses no fue suficiente como para crear ese efecto, aunque si el experimento se hubiese prolongado por más tiempo, se supone que dichas plántulas provocarían a largo plazo, un incremento similar en el reclutamiento de plantas colonizadoras.
Se considera que el experimento ha debido ser más largo para poder evaluar apropiadamente los efectos de los distintos tratamientos sobre el reclutamiento de plantas nativas, aunque ello habría aumentado mucho más el riesgo de contaminación. Sin embargo, los resultados mostrados señalan que los tratamientos micorrizados fueron los que reclutaron la mayor parte de las plantas, particularmente el tratamiento M1+P el cual a pesar de ello, no arrojó un resultado que se distinguiera estadísticamente del tratamiento P. Por lo tanto, con los datos presentados no se puede afirmar concluyentemente que la presencia de micorrizas sea la responsable del mayor reclutamiento de especies nativas, aunque existen datos en la literatura que así lo demuestran (Stanley et al., 1993). Observaciones a más largo plazo son indispensables para llegar a una conclusión definitiva respecto a este punto.
Pareciera que la presencia de Glomus manihotis estuviese influyendo positivamente en el reclutamiento y sobre todo en el establecimiento y supervivencia de las colonizadoras. G. manihotis ha sido señalado en la literatura como un hongo muy eficiente (Sieverding 1991) pudiendo ser especialmente compatible con las especies reclutadas en este experimento.
Resulta sorprendente el hallazgo de que independientemente de que la planta nodriza se encontrara micorrizada o no, la gran mayoría (83%) de las plantas colonizadoras estaban micorrizadas. Esto apoya la hipótesis formulada hace ya varios años donde se señala que dada la baja disponibilidad de nutrientes y especialmente de P de los suelos de La Gran Sabana, las micorrizas deberían ser un rasgo obligado de la vegetación colonizadora de la zona (Cuenca y Lovera, 1992). En efecto, incluso familias botánicas que en otras latitudes son consideradas no micorrízicas como las ciperáceas, en La Gran Sabana, están generalmente asociadas con HMA (Lovera y Cuenca, 1996). Así, las plantas reclutadas que fueron registradas durante el experimento estaban en su mayoría micorrizadas o creciendo en suelos fertilizados, pues de lo contrario, lo más probable es que hubieran muerto antes de lograr ser censadas por este trabajo.
En suma, las micorrizas arbusculares aunadas a una dosis relativamente baja de P, propiciaron el reclutamiento de especies nativas de La Gran Sabana alrededor de plantas nodrizas de altura superior a los 27cm, lo cual a largo plazo podría ser utilizado como una estrategia viable para reiniciar la sucesión vegetal en áreas degradadas donde debido a la escasez de nutrientes y de propágulos de micorrizas, la recolonización espontánea por parte de la vegetación natural es prácticamente nula. Este estudio fue realizado con el fin de recopilar datos que faciliten la rehabilitación de áreas más extensas de sabana. Los resultados que se obtuvieron se usarán para guiar proyectos venideros de restauración. "

In this study conducted in Bruce Peninsula National Park, researchers tested whether the natural canopy species, Thuja occidentalis, can be restored to degraded coastal cliff edges without reducing the number of visitors to the park. A combination of seed and nursery-reared seedlings 4 years of age and 10 years of age was used to evaluate eight different treatments designed to test the effects of planting site (distance from cliff edge and pathways) and supportive measures (soil, water, protective cages, or signs) on survival, growth, and damage. After four growing seasons, trees planted away from the cliff edge and away from pathways had the greatest establishment success, 4-year survival, and general health. Spot counts of visitors to the park showed that relative visitor density had a greater effect on restoration success than any other factor. In fact, the results suggest a threshold of visitor density above which restoration may be impossible. Consequently, it is concluded that restoration of cliff-edge forest habitats is possible without total visitor exclusion but that some restrictions on visitor numbers or activities are necessary.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry, Other In Bruce Peninsula National Park, Ontario, hiking trails along the cliff edges of the Niagara Escarpment offer a spectacular view of the waters of Georgian Bay and may be used by more than 20,000 visitors in a single season (Kettle 1998). Heavily visited areas along the cliffs show visible degradation of the cliff-edge forest, and the most disturbed sections of cliff edge are virtually denuded of vegetation (Larson 1990; Parikesit et al. 1995). In undisturbed parts of the park, the cliff edges support a characteristic stunted old-growth forest community, which is dominated by the woody species Thuja occidentalis (eastern white cedar) (Larson et al. 1989). Fierce winds, ice, rock fall and searing sun exposure torment the trees and likely cause their dwarfed and twisted shapes. The cedars are part of a much more complex ecosystem than was previously imagined. The barren-looking cliff face is actually covered with mosses and lichen, while countless caves and crevices provide homes for ravens, turkey vultures, swallows and bats. Other commonly seen wildlife on the Bruce Peninsula includes: chipmunk, squirrel, raccoon, porcupine, snowshoe hare, skunk, white-tailed deer, snakes and frogs. Black bear, fox, fisher, martin and the Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake are less commonly seen.
The Massasauga rattlesnake, an endangered species, is now reduced to a few scattered populations. The snake was once found throughout southern Ontario, and Bruce Peninsula National Park, the largest remaining extension of natural habitat in the region, plays an important role in preserving suitable habitat for this species. To evaluate the possibility of restoring the canopy species T. occidentalis to degraded cliff edges in Bruce Peninsula National Park without reducing visitor numbers.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
This project was conducted with the support of Parks Canada as a small-scale trial intended to help guide larger-scale restoration efforts envisaged for the near future.

Description of Project Activities: The study was conducted along a 360 m long and 10 m wide section of Niagara Escarpment cliff edge that included two of the major points of interest within Bruce Peninsula National Park: the Grotto and Indian Head Cove, as well as adjacent less frequently visited parts of the shoreline. To stratify for differences in current disturbance levels, the sampling area was divided into 10 blocks of 36 m each, and the relative disturbance within each was quantified by conducting visitor counts. Over a 2-hr period on three separate dates (21 July, 5 August, and 1 September 1999), simultaneous counts were taken every 5 minutes of the number of people present within each block. All observation periods were then summed to provide a relative measure of visitation rate for each block.

Each block was divided into 24 sections of 1.5 m length, and these were randomly assigned to three tree age classes and eight treatments. A planting site, consisting of a soil-filled depression or crevice in the rock, was selected within each section. Such planting sites reflect the natural habitats of the trees in this ancient forest (Matthes-Sears & Larson 1995). Sites were located either within a meter of the cliff edge or 10 m away from the edge, depending on the treatment. At the 10-m distance, where visitor traffic has created a dense network of small footpaths, planting sites selected were either disturbed (on pathways) or undisturbed. No such distinction was possible for cliff edge sites where disturbance was uniformly heavy. Each planting site was further categorized by canopy cover as either shady, open, or intermediate.

Three age classes of T. occidentalis were used for planting: 10-year-old trees, 4-year-old trees, and seeds. All seed had been collected in the autumn of 1996 from cliffs in southern Ontario and was stored at 4Âº C. Some of the seed was pre-germinated in a growth chamber at 30Âº C/8-hr light and 20Âº C/16-hr dark on moist filter paper and was used when the radicle was starting to protrude. The trees had been grown from seed and kept in pots outdoors at the University of Guelph.

The eight treatments were designed to test the effects of ameliorating growth conditions by adding soil, water, or soil and water; protecting trees with brightly colored signs or cages; and varying the planting location with respect to disturbance and distance from the cliff edge. Soil addition took place at planting and consisted of 500 mL of commercial potting mix (Pro-Mix; Premier Horticulture, RiviÁ¨re-du-Loup, Québec) for 4-year-old trees and seeds and twice that amount for 10-year-old trees. Watering was performed during the first growing season only and consisted of a once weekly soaking of the soil surrounding the tree or seeds. Cages were open at the top and were constructed of poultry netting 80 cm high for 10-year-old trees, 60 cm high for 4-year-old trees, and 40 cm high for seeds. Signs were of yellow plastic, 15 cm in diameter, and inscribed ""Replanted tree""”please do not disturb."" They were placed immediately adjacent to the planting site.

Each planting location received one tree or several seeds. The trees were planted during the last week of May 1997. Five pre-germinated seeds per site were planted during the first week of June 1997. When few seedlings emerged, another five germinated seeds were added to the same sites in half of the blocks 2 weeks later. A third planting of 10 ungerminated seeds per site was performed in April 1998. All trees and seeds were watered once immediately after planting.

Each planting site was visited for data collection at the following intervals: weekly, biweekly, and monthly in the first, second and third growing seasons, respectively, and at the beginning (May) and end (September) of the fourth growing season.

Damage and shoot growth were assessed on five (10-year-old trees) or three (4-year-old trees) randomly selected branches plus the main leader of each tree. New branches were selected and tagged at the beginning of each growing season. At each visit, a score between 0 and 5 was assigned to each branch in three categories: breakage, representing damage caused by humans (most often by trampling); herbivore damage; and browning (also including yellowing or wilting) as a sign of general poor health of the tree. To measure shoot growth, a small mark of nontoxic paint was placed on the leader of the branch and the distance from the mark to the growing tip was measured (Matthes-Sears et al. 1995). Also at each visit, the angle of the main axis with respect to the horizontal plane and the presence of exposed roots were scored on a scale of 1 - 3.

At the end of the study, each tree was assigned to one or more fate categories that took into account not only whether the tree survived but also its health, exposure to disturbances, and likely reason for mortality. These fate categories were as follows:

Fate 1: healthy throughout
Fate 2: variable health
Fate 3: survived partial uprooting
Fate 4: survived trampling
Fate 5: survived herbivory
Fate 6: survived cage damage
Fate 7: failed to become established
Fate 8: died without external factors
Fate 9: uprooted
Fate 10: trampled
Fate 11: herbivory
Fate 12: cage damage 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The first planting of seeds in 1997 resulted in the emergence of five seedlings from the 400 seeds planted, an emergence rate of 1.25%. None of the seedlings survived past the second week. Emergence rate was 17.5% for the second planting in 1997, with the seedlings evenly distributed over all blocks and treatments. All of these seedlings died within a few weeks except for one that survived until midsummer 1998. No seedlings emerged from the ungerminated seed planted in April 1998, although several natural seedlings were observed in the vicinity of the plots.

Mortality of planted trees in both age classes was greatest in the year of planting and decreased over time. Overall, 64.4%, 44.4%, 39.4%, and 38.8% of trees survived the first, second, third, and fourth years, respectively. Life table analysis revealed no significant difference in survivorship curves between 4-year-old and 10-year-old trees. There were, however, significant differences among treatment groups. Survival was highest for trees planted 10 m away from the cliff edge in undisturbed locations (treatment 8); 95% of these trees survived the first year, and 85% were alive at the end of the study. Lowest survival (35% after year 1, 20% at the end of the study) was seen in trees planted at the cliff edge without supplements (treatment 1). All other treatments were intermediate, and only the difference between the two extremes was significant. Significant differences in survivorship curves were also found among blocks. Survival was highest in block 1, with 94% of trees surviving the first year and 87.5% the fourth year. Block 1 was significantly different from blocks 9 and 10, where 31% of trees survived year 1 and only 6.25% (corresponding to a single tree out of the 16 planted in this block) survived to the end of the study.

Twenty-one percent of all trees became well established and were healthy throughout the study period (fate category 1). Another 21% alternated between health and decline but were alive at the end of the study (fate 2). Fifteen percent of trees failed to become established (fate 7), and another 9% died without obvious external causes after alternating periods of health and decline (fate 8).

Shoot growth in surviving trees showed the typical seasonal course with fastest rates early in the year and a slowing down by midsummer. Total seasonal growth showed no significant differences among treatments, blocks, and tree ages for each of the 3 years that measurements were taken. Neither block nor treatment affected seasonal growth patterns of surviving trees, but small and large trees differed in their growth curve in the year of planting. Contrasts for the individual time intervals showed that the age x time interaction was only significant for the very first time interval in 1997, the month immediately after planting. Growth rate during this period was significantly faster in 4-year-old trees than in 10-year-old trees; thereafter, growth rates were statistically the same for both age groups. For the following 2 years, there were no significant differences in growth rates among age groups, but 10-year-old trees tended to grow slightly faster. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The results of the study show that a low survival rate of T. occidentalis is correlated with high visitor numbers in the more popular sections of cliff edge in Bruce Peninsula National Park. The visitor counts showed a more than 150-fold range in visitor numbers as a result of the visitor flow patterns within the study area. The corresponding range in restoration success was approximately 15-fold, from a 4-year survival rate of 87.5% in block 1 to 6.25% in blocks 9 and 10. The large effect of disturbance on restoration potential is underlined by the result that for almost all measures of restoration success, differences among blocks within the study area exceeded all differences among treatments.

Indeed, the patterns of visitor density explain much of the variation in tree survival, fate, and damage seen within the study area. Block 1, with the lowest visitor density, had the highest 4-year survival rate, the fewest trees that failed to become established and the lowest scores for browning, breakage and root exposure. Block 10 had the lowest survival rate and the highest damage scores. However, although visitor impact was clearly the major factor causing mortality of planted trees, it was not the only factor, and not all results are explained by visitor numbers. For example, survival rates in block 9 were as low as in block 10, even though block 9 had much lower visitor numbers. Conversely, block 6 had a low frequency of trees that failed to become established and a high frequency of trees that were healthy throughout, even though it received the second highest number of visitors. Visitor residence time may play a role in these discrepancies, as visitors lingering in an area are likely to have a greater impact than those passing through quickly, as most do in block 6.

In all, approximately 95% of trees died as a result of external causes such as uprooting, trampling or herbivory, while damage from dislodged or trampled cages (fate 12) probably contributed to the death of the other 5%. 

Thirty-seven percent of all trees were partially or completely uprooted at some point during the study period, and this was the most frequent external cause of tree death (fate 9). Sixteen percent were completely uprooted and either died immediately or disappeared (fate 9a and b), and in another 8% partial uprooting led to a slow decline and eventual death (fate 9c). Twelve percent of trees survived a partial uprooting (fate 3).

Twenty-five percent of all trees were severely or repeatedly trampled at some point during the study period. For 7%, this was almost certainly the reason for their subsequent death (fate 10a); 7% survived it (fate 4), and for 11% it was a contributing factor but not necessarily the only reason for their death (fate 10b). Seven percent of trees experienced serious herbivory at some point during the study period; herbivory was the most likely reason for the death of 3% of trees (fate 11). Four percent experienced similar levels of herbivory but survived (fate 5).

The different fates were not homogeneously distributed over the eight treatments, and tests of independence confirmed that some of these differences were significant. Comparisons of the number of trees that survived and were healthy throughout (fate 1) versus the number of trees that died without external causes (fates 7 and 8) for different treatments show how the establishment and survival of trees are affected by the treatments in the absence of external reasons for mortality. Trees were more likely to be successful in the presence of added water, added soil, or both, whereas failure was more likely in the absence of these factors. Establishment success was significantly lower at the cliff edge than 10 m away from the edge; away from the edge, it did not differ between pathways and undisturbed locations.

Herbivore damage, whether fatal or not, was rare at the cliff edge but much more common 10 m away from the cliff edge: 22.5% of all trees in treatments 7 and 8 experienced herbivory, as opposed to only 2.5% of all trees in the other six treatments.

The frequencies of the different fates also differed across the study area. Blocks 1 and 2 as well as 5 and 6 had a low proportion of trees that failed to become established or died without external causes and a high proportion of trees that were healthy throughout, whereas the opposite was true for blocks 3 and 4 as well as 7 - 10. Blocks 8 - 10 had a high incidence of trees trampled or uprooted but a low incidence of herbivory. 

There was also a significant relationship between establishment success (as measured by the relative frequencies of fate 1 vs. fates 7 and 8) and the characteristics of the planting site. In fact, the planting site was the second most important factor behind visitor numbers affecting the survival, fate and damage scores of planted trees. Trees planted in the presence of shade from nearby canopy trees were much more likely to be healthy throughout and much less likely to die quickly without external causes than trees planted in sites classified as open.

Another important aspect of the planting site--this one controlled by the treatment--was the distance from pathways and the distance from the cliff edge. The effect of trampling was only studied away from the cliff edge because no undisturbed sites were available at the cliff edge. Planting sites on pathways were less favorable for the successful establishment of T. occidentalis than were untrampled planting sites. Besides ongoing disturbance, this may be due to decreased soil depth and litter cover and increased soil bulk density (Parikesit et al. 1995). Soils compacted by trampling are generally considered unfavorable for seedling establishment and early growth (Tuttle et al. 1988).

Trees planted at the cliff edge were more likely to die soon after planting or suffer root exposure and poor health and had lower 4-year survival rates than trees planted in equally disturbed locations 10 m away from the cliff edge. A number of factors may be responsible for this pattern, which is also seen in natural seedling establishment at cliff edges (Bartlett et al. 1991). Shallow soils near the cliff edge may exacerbate root exposure due to trampling, which in turn makes trees more susceptible to drought and wind throw (James et al. 1979). Microclimatic conditions become more severe at the cliff edge, in particular water availability, temperature fluctuations, and wind speed (Bartlett et al. 1990). In Bruce Peninsula National Park, this natural gradient may have been further increased by the absence of canopy-forming trees from the most disturbed cliff edges. The analysis showed that trees planted in shady conditions, regardless of treatment or block, were more likely to remain healthy throughout the study period than trees planted in open areas. In blocks 5 and 6, where survival rates were better than expected from the high visitor density, more than half the trees had been planted in the shade; conversely, all trees in block 9, which had lower than expected survival rates, had been planted in open locations. All of the trees in the fate category ""failed to become established"" had been planted in open conditions and none in the shade. Although a tree canopy is generally known to create conditions favorable for tree establishment (McChesney et al. 1995), such a large effect was not expected for T. occidentalis, which is said to regenerate best on exposed mineral soils with abundant light (Johnston 1990). The only advantage of the cliff edge as a planting site was the absence of herbivory by rabbits or rodents; however, herbivory was not a major cause of mortality in this study.

Getting visitors to refrain from damage-causing activities is a common challenge on public land with high visitor traffic (Mortensen 1989), and efforts to protect plantings from human damage were of only limited success in this experiment. Regardless of treatment group, many planted trees were actively and in some cases violently dislodged or uprooted by visitors. Visitors appeared unresponsive to the signs conveying appeals not to disturb the trees: Signs had no effect at all on tree survival, fate, damage, or growth. The high frequency with which the signs were trampled or dislodged suggests they may need to be larger to be noticed.

Futhermore, the physical protection of trees by caging had mixed success, as cages were frequently found at the bottom of the cliff or suspended in the canopy of neighboring trees after having apparently been removed by visitors. For the smaller trees, cages significantly decreased the amount of breakage, most likely because visitors were encouraged to walk around rather than step over the trees. However, the survival rate of these trees was unaffected by caging, as were fate, browning, and growth rate. For large trees the enclosures were detrimental, increasing the amount of breakage compared with uncaged trees. Most likely, this was because these trees were too tall to be stepped over even when uncaged, and the taller cages were more likely than shorter ones to be removed by visitors or blown over by the wind, causing breakage to the trees within them.
In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that the planting of smaller (e.g., 4-year-old) container-grown trees without supportive measures of any kind is the best approach for cliff-edge restoration in Bruce Peninsula National Park. Very few T. occidentalis emerged from seed (regardless of treatment, disturbance, and whether or not seeds were pre-germinated), and none of them survived for more than a year. Although water and soil addition made a small improvement in survival, this improvement was disproportionately small considering the effort involved in carrying water or soil to the planting sites. The same was true for protective cages, whose small improvement to survival was far outweighed by the effort required for setup and maintenance, in addition to the aesthetic drawback. The size and age of container-grown trees are unimportant, but smaller trees are recommended because they are easier to grow, transport, and plant. The broader implication of these results is that, in other settings, the age-related patterns of mortality should be carefully examined in the context of the site conditions before the restoration materials and protocols are selected. The large differences in tree survival between trampled and untrampled planting sites suggest that, in conjunction with reforestation, the current network of small pathways should be blocked off using boulders or brush and replaced by a single clearly marked main trail or boardwalk. The effectiveness of such visitor channeling is apparent from the high planting success in the heavily visited blocks 5 and 6, where a dense forest in combination with topography has so far largely prevented the networking of pathways so evident in other parts of the study area. Since shade from existing canopy trees was shown to favor restoration efforts, one management priority should be to prevent the further degradation of cliff edges to the point where few or no canopy trees remain. Where such trees are absent, as they are currently in the most disturbed parts of the study area, restoration may be difficult under current circumstances and a temporary reduction in visitor admissions may need to be considered. Such a reduction would be most beneficial during the summer holiday season and into the autumn, when our data show visitor impacts to be greatest.
A drastic reduction of visitor admissions to Bruce Peninsula National Park is only one possible way to improve the success of a future cliff-edge restoration project. The fate data indicate that a large proportion of tree mortality results from careless (trampling of trees) or even intentionally destructive (uprooting of trees) visitor behavior. If park managers find a way to specifically target these behaviors, for example, through increased efforts at visitor education in combination with increased surveillance at peak times, it may be possible to have successful site restoration coexist with large visitor numbers enjoying the park in appropriate ways.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/indonesia-central-kalimantan-peatlands-restoration-project/	Indonesia: Central Kalimantan Peatlands Restoration Project	Indonesia	2005-12-18	2008-12-18	"The Central Kalimantan Peatlands Project (CKPP) grew out of an increasing recognition at the local, national and international levels of the urgency of halting and reversing degradation of the peatswamp forests of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Drainage, illegal logging and fire have devastated the area’s peatswamps in recent decades, and the impacts on local livelihoods, the broader economy and critical wildlife habitats have been staggering. Moreover, the annual contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions has been massive, as the decomposing peat releases stored CO2 at an alarming rate. In response to the mounting crisis, the CKPP was developed as a large-scale restoration programme aimed at rehabilitating these vital ecosystems and safeguarding the region’s rich biodiversity. Implemented by a local five-member consortium, the project focused on damming drainage canals to restore natural hydrologic conditions, revegetating denuded areas with commercially-important native tree species, and taking steps to improve local socio-economic conditions while introducing sustainable agricultural techniques. The pilot phase completed in late 2008 provides a strong foundation for future conservation and restoration activities in Central Kalimantan and serves as a basis for other, similar activities in the rest of Indonesia and elsewhere in the tropics of Asia.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation, Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Unsustainable agricultural practices and logging activities pose a serious threat to the future existence of Central Kalimantan’s locally and globally important peatlands ecosystems. The region has suffered severely from forest fires and excessive drainage, largely resulting from the failed Ex-Mega Rice Project (EMRP), a government-sponsored rural development program that subjected 1.4 million hectares to intensive logging and systematic drainage.
Under the EMRP, about 4,400 km of drainage canals, some up to 10 metres deep, were excavated to lower the water table across vast areas of peatland forest and convert them for agricultural production. Once these canals began to fail (e.g. buildup of organic debris, collapsing banks), work on the drainage network ceased. However, the lattice of canals quickly proved destructive for habitat conservation and management efforts, as the drainage of EMRP peatlands has precipitated major, and largely irreversible, impacts over great distances, seriously compromising the ecological integrity of the entire region. The most direct impacts include:
Drainage canals have greatly affected surface water storage and flows, over large areas. The increased drainage has caused rapid desiccation and peat humification and has removed the characteristic hummock-hollow top layer that plays an important role in keeping peatlands wet in their natural state. This has prolonged the period when water tables are below the peat surface, which in turn has caused peat decomposition and subsidence. Downstream of the peatlands, the result of drainage can be increased peak runoffs and, thus, more flooding risk.
The impact of drainage is most severe in a zone of approximately 500 metres along the canals, where subsidence and possibly fire frequency are greater, resulting in relatively steep surface slopes away from canals. Peat surface elevations 1 km from canals are now generally 0.5 to 1 m higher than the canal sides. Instead of the original low-gradient peatland landscape that functioned as a single hydrological system over tens of square kilometres, a “mini-dome” topography has developed because of drainage. This now controls the hydrology of the area.
Not only did the lattice of canals lower the water table and dry organic soils, but it also provided improved access to what were once remote and largely inaccessible forests. Illegal logging operators took advantage of the new waterways to deforest areas near the canals and to excavate lesser channels radiating away from the canals in order to remove logs from even more interior locations. Moreover, the ranks of illegal loggers swelled, as thousands of settlers relocated under the EMRP soon found the acidic and infertile soils unsuitable for agriculture and turned to logging to supplement their income. These drained, logged areas became desiccated and fire prone, and are now the scene of devastating annual peat fires.
Fires in this peatland forest area can be triggered naturally through lightening strikes or by human interventions (e.g. discarded cigarettes, uncontrolled camp/cooking fires, clearance for agriculture). Fires in peatlands are devastating to the forest plant communities and structures, as well as the basic forest soils that sustain the vegetation. Unlike mineral soils in forests, organic soils are severely affected by fires, particularly when they are in a dry state. Of particular concern is the fact that fires in peatland forests can lead to massive carbon emissions, as happened in 1997 with the series of fires exacerbated by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. It is estimated that between 0.81 and 2.57 gigatonnes of carbon were released into the atmosphere as a result of burning peat and vegetation, an amount equivalent to 13-40% of mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels. Many fire patterns in Indonesia are directly linked to the network of canals and ditches. The morphology, soil conditions and hydrology of peat swamps are so closely interrelated that the slightest change in vegetation will have an immediate effect on the morphology and hydrology of the swamps, and any change in hydrology will change the vegetation.
This relationship can be observed in the vegetation zoning within a single peat dome. Nearest to rivers, lush forests receive abundant nutrients from river water and produce tall, productive trees. At the top of the peat dome, nutrients are scarce, as rain water is the only source. Thus, the forest has lower species diversity here, and trees are typically smaller (Pole forest), or occur only occasionally in stunted forms (“Padang”). Between these extremes are found mixed swamp forest types that are intermediate in the size, structure and diversity of trees. These vegetation patterns are reflected in the slopes, which are lowest on top and bottom, and in the peat type, which is least decomposed at the top of the dome and most decomposed lower down, near the rivers. As the peatlands have developed over several thousand years, these eco-hydrological zones have shifted to reflect internal and external changes. As the peat dome grows higher and wider above the floodplain with the continuing accumulation of dead organic material, a larger and larger area eventually sustains only a pole or “Padang” forest. Changes in river courses, peak river levels and rainfall also affect the development of the peat dome. As such, the peatlands are truly a dynamic and living landscape.
The Sebangau River catchment of Central Kalimantan, a blackwater river system that originates in, and drains, the last remaining large continuous area (13,000 km2) of dense peat swamp forest in Borneo, was the site of the restoration activities conducted under this project. The area is dominated by several peatland habitat types:
–Tall Interior Forest–
Found in areas with a peat depth of up to 12 metres, the tall interior forest has well stratified vegetation, with trees reaching a maximum height of approximately 45m, including Agathis, Koompassia, Shorea and Palaquium.
–Mixed Swamp Forest–
The mixed swamp forest is restricted to the Sebangau water catchment. It has layers of peat up to 6m deep with “peat islands” or hummocks that rise above the floodplain bisected by shallow drainage channels. Some of the hummocks are formed from decomposing tree-trunks, and are covered with tree seedlings and grassy vegetation. Most of the large sized hummocks are actually root plates of big trees. The soil surface on hummocks and hollows is covered with a continuous layer of leaves, which fall constantly from the trees. During the rainy season, the forest floor is largely waterlogged, as the hollows are filled with water that has risen above the soil surface. This accumulated water slowly streams from the interior towards the swamp edges. The mixed swamp forest is a stratified habitat that contains commercially valuable trees such as Gonystylus bancanus (ramin), Dactylocladus stenostachys (mentibu) and Cratoxylon glaucum (geronggang).
–Low Pole or “Padang” Forest–
This forest type occurs on the deepest peat and contains very few trees of commercial importance. The forest floor is undulating with large hummocks and deep depressions containing pools. Tree pneumatophores are a constant feature, and there is a dense root mat in the surface peat. Many trees show abnormal growth, often growing to a height of 9-12m before the leading shoots die. Because of the higher light levels penetrating the forest canopy and the high water table, there is a very dense growth of several Pandanus and Freycinetia spp. The most abundant pitcher plant in this forest type is Nepethes ampullaria, which forms dense carpets of pitchers on the ground, but also extends upwards into the middle canopy.
Peat swamp forests provide many upland and riparian habitats and have a unique atmosphere defined in large part by the sounds of many different animals. Sebangau National Park is home to 150 bird, 35 mammal and 36 fish species, and harbours about 10% of Kalimantan’s remaining Orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus wurnbii) population (6,000-9,000). Inventories in Ex-Mega Rice Project areas that still have vegetation coverage, including Block A north, have revealed the occurrence of at least 62 bird, 12 mammal and 6 reptile species.
In Block E (Mawas area), 63 mammal species have been recorded, including nine primate species. Two hundred eighteen bird species, 21 amphibians and 45 reptile species have been identified as well. In addition, there are at least 44 fish species, including such endemics as Tuka (Channa bankanensis) and Kapar (Belontia hasselti). There are also migratory white fish species, such as Saluang kahui (Rasbora cephalotaenia) and Banta (Osteohilus triporos). The objective of the Central Kalimantan Peatlands Project was to maintain and restore peatlands in the Sebangau National Park area, Block E (Mawas) and other parts of the Ex-Mega Rice Project (EMRP) in order to improve biodiversity conservation over approximately two million hectares. In order to meet this objective, the project focused on improving the hydrology of the peatswamp forests and degraded peatlands, regreening degraded peatlands and reducing the incidence of and damage by fires.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
There is a clear linkage between peatland degradation and poverty, as the occurrence of peatlands in developing countries often coincides with rural poverty. Remaining wilderness areas and their natural resources provide a buffer for communities that are located far from markets and lacking in economic solvency. These communities often rely on the natural productivity of peatland ecosystems or make use of their potential by converting them for subsistence agriculture. The natural ecosystems enhance their food security, are important for the survival of their cultures and form the basis for their livelihoods. Consequently, effectively promoting the sustainable use and conservation of wetlands and their resources involves focusing on their value to local people. This means that the solutions to peatland degradation must put people first and must incorporate development and community-based action.
Central Kalimantan has become one of the poorest regions in Indonesia, largely because of peatland drainage and peat fire disasters. The area has suffered from a loss of resources, loss of development opportunities and increased risk for investors, all while it copes with difficulties in providing schooling and health services. Environmental degradation and poverty mutually reinforce each other, creating a vicious cycle that can only be addressed through a combined approach of development, peatland rehabilitation and conservation.
The CKPP partners have worked closely with local communities and authorities throughout the project to address these issues and solicit their expertise and experience in helping to resolve them. The design of specific planning activities and the mode of implementation were entirely bottom-up, being developed in collaboration with a Local Advisory Group chaired by the provincial Vice-Governor and assisted by an International Advisory Group formed to provide advice at the international level. Good cooperation with the local stakeholders has been a critical success factor, and this cooperation will also ensure the sustainability of the project’s activities beyond the end of the project.

Description of Project Activities: CKPP worked in two main areas of Central Kalimantan: the Sebangau National Park area and the Ex-Mega Rice Project (EMRP) area, especially Block A north and Blocks B, C and E (Mawas). Within these areas, the activities focused on 25 villages in four districts (Katingan, Pulang Pisau, Kapuas and South Barito). 

--Hydrology Restoration--
CKPP's hydrology restoration activities focused on Block A, North and East of the EMRP, and Sebangau National Park. Interventions to restore the hydrological systems involved the development of a technical design for dams, their construction and maintenance, and hydrological monitoring. Hydrological restoration was linked closely to regreening activities.

In the last decade, through similar work in Sumatra and Central Kalimantan, Wetlands International has developed and experimented with dam designs that can withstand enormous water pressure while standing in the very soft soils of peatlands. These types of dams were built in the project areas to block major drainage canals, some of them are over twenty metres wide. In the EMRP and Sebangau National Park, the consortium built 24 large dams and 263 small dams. More than 900 workers, divided into 39 groups, were involved in building these dams.

Information from field surveys formed the basis of the design and technical specification of the dams. CKPP used a design of winged blocks with a spill way. This design was based on the culmination of experience from previous designs. It was used in both blocking large canals (EMRP) and the smaller canals used for illegal logging. The main materials used were round timber (galam - Melaleuca sp), mineral soil in bags for filling the dam, and wooden boards and geotextile/tarpaulin to cover the spill way, which is there to reduce pressure on the dam. In this project, a new design feature was incoporated in which trees were planted on and behind the dams. Eventually, the dams should become redundant when vegetation and peat start to block the channel. The trees on the dam will then help to keep the soil inside the dam in place.

Dam construction involved three phases:

Pre-construction: This phase included group preparation and capacity development; mobilisation of manpower, equipment, and materials; and determination of the reference points of the dams.

Construction: Building materials were transported to the site in the wet season, which is also the best season to construct the dams. In this phase, the wood structure for the block was constructed, followed by filling the blocks with sandbags containing mineral soil and planting trees on the dams.

Post-construction: This involved demobilising the groups, equipment and camps.

After construction, maintenance of the dam is very important, especially in the first years. At a later stage, the canals will close and disappear as aquatic plants and trees start to add blockades. This process is very visible even within a few years of construction.

In order that the blocks remain functional, monthly monitoring and maintenance activities were conducted. A common issue that arose was the subsidence of the soil filling as it compacted. This was addressed by adding more soil bags. Another issue was the leaking of the blocks due to high water pressure, leaving the blocks vulnerable to structural damage. This was addressed by strengthening the wood structure. Damage also occurred from illegal loggers who continued using the canals to transport wood.

To monitor the effect of the dams on local hydrology, especially in Block A, North of the EMRP, instruments were installed in key locations. Forty-seven staff gauges were installed to monitor the surface water fluctuation, and 69 deep wells on nine transects served to monitor groundwater fluctuation. To complete the analysis of changes in hydrology, five manual instruments for measuring rainfall, one thermometer and three instruments to measure subsidence were also installed. Field staff collected data from these instruments twice a month, with relatively regular time intervals. In addition to hydrology monitoring, monitoring was also carried out on the impact of the dams on the surrounding wildlife. The results of identification and the preliminary qualitative conclusions indicate that the construction of the blocks had a positive effect on wildlife, especially in terms of improving animal mobility from one location to another and reducing the risk of fire. There were indications of both positive and negative impacts to aquatic life and further investigation of this is needed.

--Village Fire Brigades--
In 2006, CARE worked together with UNPAR to establish, train and equip 25 fire brigades (1 fire brigade per village). A total of 399 people (33 females and 366 males) were members of the brigades. The capacity of fire brigades to extinguish fires increased from the rate of 0.173 ha/hour in September 2006 (measured at the first training) up to an average rate of 1.75 ha/hour in November 2006 (during their first attempts to extinguish fires). CARE was responsible for activating all the brigades in Katingan and Pulang Pisau districts; BOSF did the same in Kapuas and Barito Selatan Districts.

Villagers were also trained in the development of deep wells to provide water for both fire fighting and other uses during the dry season. A total of 50 wells were developed in the Block E area, 75 units along the Trans-Kalimantan Highway, and others in the villages in the buffer zone of Sebangau National Park.

--Regreening--
Regreening is a crucial element in restoring the peatlands. Vegetation cover protects the peat against direct sunlight, creates a wet microclimate at the soil level, stores water, and reduces surface waterflow. Roots keep the peat in place and also help in storing and maintaining water.

For regreening, the project used only native forest species, mostly those with a commercial value such as jelutong (rubber for chewing gum) and belangiran (a tree precious for its meranti wood). Other tree species planted included: Gerunggang, Jambu-jambuan, Pulau rawa, Pasir-pasir and Tumih. Planting of species that will eventually have a commercial value is crucial for success, as local people are more likely to see the benefit of rewetting the area and will be motivated to prevent and control fires. In some areas, species with value as food for Orangutan were replanted in an effort to help this threatened species survive.

The regreening program in Block E can serve as an example of how regreening should be carried out. The following steps were taken:

1. Formation of community regreening groups with responsibility for the development of nurseries to raise seedlings. Target communities included those living in areas considered critical for conservation purposes.
2. Training the groups to ensure good growth levels during the seedling and planting stages.
3. The development of community-based nursery units to provide seedlings. Seedlings were obtained through stem-cutting, wildlings and fruits. To create ownership by local communities, commercial species were selected. 
4. Planting of the seedlings when they are robust enough. Often, the cover of ferns has to be removed first.
5. Maintenance during the first and sometimes second year and monitoring of tree growth.

The potential area for regreening is enormous; the entire rewetted area (around 60,000 hectares) is suitable. Regreening is, however, a very labour intensive activity; therefore, a matrix was employed to prioritize areas for regreening based on the level of critical land and management zonation. The first priority was critical or barren lands (i.e. open land with bushes) resulting from fire and illegal logging, as well as degraded lands resulting from abandoned farmland, plantations or other community usage due to changes in agricultural patterns or community livelihood (burning, illegal logging, farmland clearing, plantation, etc.). 

--Monitoring and Law Enforcement--
In order to reduce illegal logging activities inside the National Park, a series of 34 joint patrols were facilitated, involving National Park authorities, representatives of local communities and NGOs. These regular patrols resulted in reports to, and actions by, the authorities and a subsequent decrease of sawmill operations in Katingan District. A clear indication of this has been a significant decrease in log supplies. In 2006, there were 147 sawmills in Katingan Regency, 102 of which were still operating. This number had been reduced to two by the end of 2008.

Data shows that during an anti-illegal logging campaign in June 2006, a total of 1,078,360 logs, equal to 134,795 m3, were confiscated. Most of the logs originated from Sebangau National Park and were being transported through the Bulan River and Tampelas village.

In the Block E area (Mawas), monitoring was conducted by means of air, land, and river patrols. The purpose was to detect both illegal activities and fires within and around the area. During the project, 27 air patrols were carried out using ultra-light aircraft; 342 river patrols were carried out using small motorised boats; and 393 land patrols were carried out. Monitoring was also conducted every 35 days in order to determine changes in land cover. Cases of significant change (such as deforestation, damage from fire, road construction, etc.) were followed with field checks using ultra-light aircraft and navigation cameras.

--Community-based Agro-forestry--
CKPP prioritised improving the welfare of communities in the peatlands. This was a crucial element of the project, as restoration and sustainable local livelihoods are strongly inter-dependent. Poor people often have no alternative other than illegal logging or clearing rainforest areas by slash and burn. The resultant degradation worsens floods, fires, and soil subsidence, all of which exacerbate conditions of poverty. CKPP prioritised involving local communities in finding a balance between the production and environmental functions in the peatland ecosystem in order to stop this downward spiral.

The implementation of community-based agro-forestry systems (combining trees of commercial value with crops) was closely linked to regreening programmes, especially in Blocks E and A-north. From historical data on the biophysical degradation of the areas, the project was able to identify the native tree species that were appropriate for each degraded land area. A manual was subsequently produced on the development and management of strategic buffer zones, through the planting of indigenous but commercially important tree species under community-management regimes.

Farmers were encouraged to adapt their practices to take into account (and improve) the degraded natural environment. Improving the quality of the environment is a key to increasing agricultural production. In recognition of this, stakeholders' workshops were held to identify appropriate and sustainable agricultural technologies and practices. The workshops organised by CKPP, farmers, NGOs, government officials, state research institutions and academics discussed agricultural practices that have a minimal negative impact and/or a positive impact on the environment, focusing on the sub-sectors of food crops, plantations, livestock and fisheries. The outcome of these workshops was a set of standards (PEAT-GAP) identifying good agricultural practices for peatlands within each agricultural sub-sector.

At first, communities thought that sustainable agriculture would only inhibit production, but by the end of the project this perception had changed. Some 3,540 households (828 female household heads and 2,712 male household heads) in 25 villages have adopted PEAT-GAP technology and sustainable agriculture practices that are adapted to local conditions and specified standards. In addition, farmers were encouraged to try sustainable practices and let others imitate what they have done successfully. 

The project also sought to improve access to markets, with farmers' groups playing an active role in this activity. CKPP prioritised local production for local consumption, a model intended to create more equal profit sharing along the marketing chain in villages and sub-districts. The profit obtained by farmers is optimised as there are no transportation costs, which are typically borne by farmers when they sell their products to intermediaries. A lower selling price enables the poorer members of the community, with limited buying power, to reduce their expenses.

CKPP facilitated the establishment of 11 partnerships and opened access to markets for 1,094 farming households, covering 36.5% of the target population (48 females and 1,046 males). Farmers were encouraged to grow crops that are usually widely sold in the local markets yet supplied from other areas. By maintaining quality, quantity and regular supplies, farmers were able to become the main supplier of these commodities to local markets. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: In Central Kalimantan, the project, together with local communities, built 24 dams in large drainage canals and over 150 blocks in small drainage channels, restoring the hydrology of 10,000 ha in the Sebangau area and over 50,000 ha of drained and degraded peatlands in the EMRP area. These interventions increased the water table by one, and often two, metres, greatly reducing peat decomposition and subsidence.

Rewetting the areas made these peatlands far less fire-prone, and those fires that did occur were more rapidly detected and controlled by the teams of firefighters. Around 250,000 ha of peatland now have improved security from fires, and fire-fighting capacity has been improved in 25 villages. 

The project has reforested over 1,000 ha of peatlands. Two years after replanting, some tree seedlings are already a few metres high. 

Farmers were persuaded to plant seedlings of valuable indigenous tree species that can live in waterlogged conditions in order to discourage drainage of the peatlands. These commercial crops will help increase local communities' standard of living and will afford them options other than draining and deforesting peatlands. 

The project activities enhanced the status of the Sebangau National Park and of Block E by restricting illegal logging and providing alternatives for local residents. This enhanced protection was also achieved through the participation of local communities in defining the park boundaries and other aspects of planning biodiversity conservation. This helps to improve the long-term conservation of threatened species such as the Orangutan, especially through securing large areas of their peatswamp forest habitat. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The CKPP experienced constraints and weaknesses, including weak communication networks and limited capacity, synergy and integration of activities among parties involved in implementation. Externally, it is recognised that there was the potential for coordination and facilitation through the Provincial Programme Coordination Team (PPCT), but the effectiveness of this mechanism was not optimised. These issues should be addressed in any follow-up initiative involving CKPP or any similar programmes that may be developed in the future.

Not only were administrative/institutional challenges encountered, much skepticism and resistance was initially met from local community members. Peatswamp forests are valued by most local communities for many reasons, not just the timber and non-timber products that they provide. Currently 70% of the income of households living in this region comes from farming and forestry, and some 57% of households farm solely for subsistence purposes. Therefore, any change that affects agriculture, such as blocking canals or restricting the use of fire, is critically viewed. This finding implies that the provision of alternative sources of income and food is a crucial aspect in convincing farmers to switch to more sustainable practices.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: --Hydrology--
Peatlands are valuable for flood and flow regulation. They can serve as overflow or water storage areas during flooding periods, while in the dry season water is slowly released. They are also important for preventing salt water intrusion. Agriculture in tidal areas may benefit from upstream peatswamps which provide a source of fresh water for irrigation and a continuous freshwater wedge, preventing or mitigating salt water intrusion. In rural coastal areas, peatswamps may be the only source of potable and irrigation water for many months in the year.

--Climate Stabilisation--
Peatswamps are huge carbon storage areas. The carbon stored in peat represents 33% of the world's soil carbon pool, which in turn represents 70% of all carbon stored in biotic systems. Almost 20 times more carbon is stored underground as peat than above the ground in vegetation. Furthermore, healthy tropical peatswamp forests actively accumulate carbon, thus helping to decrease the greenhouse effect. It is estimated that for every hectare of peat that is rewetted, annual emissions of peat-carbon are reduced on the order of around 70 tonnes of CO2. In total, the reduction of decomposition alone (through rewetting) accounts for a reduction of approximately four million tonnes of CO2 per year. 

The existence of peatswamp forests and the associated large mass of fresh water also affects the climate on micro and meso scales. The forests act as wind breaks and absorb heat, and forested lowlands attract more rain than deforested areas.

--Local Livelihoods--
The livelihoods of the local people in Central Kalimantan are largely dependant on the natural peatswamp forests and surrounding peatlands, which comprise the main habitat in the province and project area. Socio-economic studies in Indonesia indicate that local communities may derive over 80% of their livelihoods from the peatswamp forests rather than from agriculture. The forests serve as hydrological buffers, transport corridors (e.g. peatland rivers and canals) and a source of food (e.g. fish), water (e.g. for irrigation, households and nature), construction materials (e.g. timber, rattan), as well as many other (non-timber) forest products. In addition, the peatswamp forests provide options for additional developments, such as tourism. 

--Cultural Identity--
Many of the amenities, functions and values of the peatlands are crucial, not only for the environmental and food security of these people, but also for the survival of their cultures and as a basis for their livelihoods. Indeed, the natural products and wildlife of peatswamp forests play a substantial role in the identity of the Dayak culture in Kalimantan.
The CKPP consortium has been successful in raising both local and global awareness of the problems facing peatlands in Indonesia and of their international importance as significant carbon sequesterors and climate-change mitigators. Within Indonesia, there appears to be renewed respect for peatswamps and for the environment in general. This changing perception can be noted in the reduction of illegal sawmills around forest reserves and in the increased political, public and financial support for peatland conservation. Indeed, the Provincial Government of Central Kalimantan has initiated the development of a Master Plan for Peatlands rehabilitation, and in 2007, the National Government issued Presidential Instruction No 2/2007 regarding the rehabilitation of the Ex-Mega Rice Project area.
Thanks to media coverage and consortium members’ presence at key meetings, global awareness about Indonesia’s peatlands ecosystems has also been raised. The relationship between peatlands and global climate change is now more widely recognised by the UN Convention on Climate Change (including REDD, the UN climate policy on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in developing countries), the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. All of these bodies made decisions in 2007 and 2008 that address tropical peatlands as a key ecosystem with high values for carbon storage. The CKPP is a first step towards the restoration and sustainable use of peatlands in Central Kalimantan and throughout Indonesia. The successes of the project set an important example, but are still relatively minor in comparison to the scale and intensity of problems and challenges of peatland exploitation in the area. There is a clear need for replication and expansion of restoration activities over a broader geographic context, and completion of the Master Plan for over one million hectares of the EMRP will be the next step in stimulating the long process of rehabilitation and revitalisation of the troubled area.
The CKPP brokered a deal between the Government of the Netherlands and Indonesia to develop this Master Plan. The contents of the document are still relatively general, underlining policy issues and providing guidance, and it will undoubtedly be discussed, reviewed and revised in accordance with developments over time, improvements in the science base, and changes in national and international policy frameworks and in the local situation. Nonetheless, the following recommendations have been made to orient future peatlands management activities both in Central Kalimantan and beyond:
–The results of the Master Plan in relation to structure, management and use of the EMRP area should be integrated and synchronised with the ongoing revision of the spatial plan of Central Kalimantan Province. This will provide the Master Plan with increased legal authority.
–Strategies and detailed action plans should be developed for sectoral and inter-sectoral peatland management (conservation, agriculture, transmigration, forestry, fisheries, health, tourism, etc.). Institutional structures need to be developed and enhanced to effectively and economically implement this management system.
–The pilot activities implemented by CKPP remain relevant and in line with the needs and priorities of Central Kalimantan. Further diversification will be useful, particularly with regard to emerging opportunities such as REDD, Bio-rights, biodiversity offset mechanisms and payment for environmental services.
–Project monitoring should be improved, and involve developing a detailed monitoring protocol, regular independent monitoring and evaluation of approaches, field activities and outcomes, as well as establishment of specific monitoring systems for defining and measuring impacts. Regular project monitoring should be implemented by task groups under the Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee, augmented by annual independent monitoring and evaluation surveys.
–A REDD methodology for reducing peat degradation related to emissions should be developed in the context of international developments in this regard. Local capacity should be developed for REDD methodology implementation, especially the monitoring of emissions and water levels in line with scientific and market requirements.
–The CKPP Board should include representatives of other major peatland projects to ensure coordination among donors, optimise synergies, avoid duplication and overlap and ensure that project plans relate appropriately to the local absorption capacity.
–The CKPP Board should ensure the longevity of financial mechanisms to enhance the security for local stakeholders. One of the key difficulties in resolving the unsustainable land use issues in Indonesia’s peatlands is the lack of sustainable finance mechanisms and coherent finance strategies to support an integrated approach to poverty reduction, environmental management and biodiversity conservation. In the follow-up to the Bali roadmap, and also as a result of CKPP and Master Planning, bilateral donors are now paying much more attention to peatland issues in Central Kalimantan. This was not the case at the beginning of the project. However, the high interest in this particular area also carries the danger of exceeding the absorption capacity, and there is an increased need for donor coordination. Moreover, current project-by-project funding does not provide the financial security needed for local stakeholders to change their livelihood and investment strategies. There is a clear need for guarantees of a long-term sustainable funding flow that will enable the longer-term investment strategies that are essential for achieving conservation and sustainable development. The potential of innovative mechanisms such as voluntary carbon markets, REDD funding, Payments for Environmental Services, Bio-rights and Bio-diversity offsets, offer great potential for supporting government-led as well as community-based approaches to enhancing the sustainable management and conservation of these critical carbon stores and high biodiversity areas. There is now a need for international and local systems for managing funding flows in a way that guarantees accountability and transparency requirements and can ensure the equitable allocation of carbon rights and carbon funding, empowers local stakeholders and achieves maximum participation of the poor. None of these mechanisms exist at present. Yet these will be needed for gaining the necessary support of the local communities. With the emergence of a broadly shared understanding of the need for these innovative systems, and a global awareness of joint synergistic targets (e.g. climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction), there is a window of opportunity that has not existed before. Indonesia, and the peatlands of Central Kalimantan in particular, can provide an excellent basis for developing, testing and promoting these. "

A lawsuit brought against the federal government in response to gross mismanagement of local environmental resources resulted in the inception of the Zuni Conservation Project in late 1991. Planned and implemented by the Tribe’s Fish and Wildlife Department, this unique program of watershed restoration and riparian conservation has been rooted in traditional Zuni cultural values, as plans have been developed in consultation with tribal elders, religious leaders and local landowners. The project has attempted to strike a balance between traditional water control features, employing hand labor and natural materials wherever possible, and watershed-level interventions facilitated through a series of geomorphic study stations and geographic information systems. In addition to such riparian restoration methodologies as eliminating invasive species (i.e. Tamarix pentandra), reshaping channelized watercourses, excluding sensitive areas from grazing and conducting revegetation with native species, the project has also reintroduced approximately 23 beavers to sites with impaired hydrologic flow regimes. These new recruits have quickly demonstrated their capacity to dramatically alter ecosystem dynamics, as they have immediately begun building dams and provoking favorable hydrologic changes. Areas with transplanted beavers have seen an increase in available surface and subsurface water, reduced sedimentation, fewer invasive tamarisk trees and marked improvement in the quality of adjacent riparian habitats. It is hoped that by affecting these kinds of structural changes, the beavers will ultimately help encourage the natural regeneration of much of the watershed.Agriculture & Livestock, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Beginning with European settlement in the nineteenth century, riparian ecosystems in the Zuni Watershed have undergone a series of dramatic changes. Extensive logging and overgrazing in the late 1800s and early-to-mid 1900s severely degraded the watershed, resulting in a decline in vegetative cover that increased surface erosion, gullying, headcutting, wide discharge fluctuations and loss of water in the system. The most significant causes of degradation in more recent times are:
–Man-made dams–
Man-made dams have changed the hydraulics of rivers and streams, making many formerly perennial watercourses semi-perennial or ephemeral. Water stored in large lakes and reservoirs, while locally raising the water table and making water available at a few sites, reduces the availability of water in other reaches of a stream by increasing evaporation from surface water, which in this part of the US reaches 54 in (137 cm) per year (Kohler and others, 1959). It also ultimately reduces the total amount of water in the system. The approximate surface area of the nine major and several minor reservoirs on the Zuni Reservation is 1,546 acres, which translates to more than 6,900 acre free (2.25 x 10-8 gallons, or 8.51 x 10-8 liters) per year of water (Orr, 1987). In addition, many reservoirs in this area create a “sediment deficit” in their downstream watercourses. Where formerly sediment-rich river water would travel a stream, depositing and picking up sediment as it went (depending on factors such as stream velocity and channel shape), the below-dam reach of stream carries little sediment and, having nothing to deposit, can only pick up sediment–a process that can severely erode the reaches of a stream immediately downstream of the reservoir.
–Channelization–
In an effort to reduce flooding and increase the efficiency of water transport, many rivers have been channelized, cleared of vegetation, and their sinuous shapes straightened. Unfortunately, this steepens the gradient, increasing water speed, reducing infiltration and increasing erosion. While this may reduce water lost by evapo-transpiration, it also increases direct evaporation from the water surface as shading is reduced. In addition, flash flooding increases as wetlands are destroyed or degraded.
–Encroachment of alien plants, including salt cedar (Tamarix pentandra)–
Salt cedar produces large amounts of seed, which germinate readily. In many situations it out-competes species such as cottonwood and willow for water and light, and uses much more water than either of these two plants (Carmen and Brotherson, 1982). It also changes the soil chemistry of a site by bringing salts to the surface, making it difficult for other plants to survive (Hollingsworth, 1973), and in many areas it forms a dense monoculture. The tree has relatively little value for wildlife and is extremely difficult to eradicate, responding to either burning or cutting by resprouting. Removal of this plant often restores much of the natural hydrological and biological dynamics to an area (Anderson and Barrows, 1998).
–Loss of beavers–
With the reduction of beavers, an important component in the riparian ecosystem was lost and riparian ecosystems began to degrade. Small ponds no longer filtered out sediment, and water quality declined. Vast acreages of wetlands surrounding ponds were encroached upon by surrounding, drier upland forests. Water tables were lowered, and the water budget of many watersheds decreased as water traveled rapidly downstream and out of the upper watersheds. From a biological standpoint, riparian areas, wetlands and springs offer some of the best biodiversity in the semi-arid high desert of the Colorado Plateau, as a far greater proportion of wildlife uses the riparian corridor than the surrounding landscape. In one study conducted in the Upper Rio Nutria Watershed, a sub-watershed of the Zuni River, 37 percent of the individual birds occupied the riparian corridor of the Rio Nutria, an area which encompasses only about 2 percent of the land area surveyed. The diversity of bird species in the riparian corridor was also far greater than in the surrounding uplands.
Beavers (Castor canadensis) were at one time found on most streams in the Southwest in areas where there was permanent water and sufficient woody vegetation to provide food (Hill, 1982). Where beavers were present, they modified their habitat as no other single species did. Their dams created large areas of still water and habitat for fish, waterfowl and other birds, mammals, amphibians and invertebrates. The ponds themselves filtered sediment out of the streamwater and improved water quality downstream. Water percolated into the soil, recharging aquifers and creating moist upland habitat in the areas surrounding the dams. Over time, as ponds filled with sediment and became shallower, they eventually turned to marshes and then meadows. By then the beavers had moved on to other parts of the stream or watershed to begin the process anew. These dynamic shifts in habitat were important components in maintaining the biodiversity of the landscape. To assist the recovery of degraded riparian areas in the Zuni watershed through the reintroduction of beavers at select sites in order to precipitate favorable changes in the hydrologic regime.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
In late 1991, the Zuni Tribe established the Zuni Conservation Project to lead a program of watershed restoration and resource development. Community-based, consensus-building workshops have been organized to inform the planning process, as have interviews with religious leaders, farmers, livestock growers, and other land users. Not only are project activities developed in consultation with local stakeholders, they must be approved by a tribal council of elders. In this way, traditional Zuni land use practices have become central to the scope and mission of Zuni’s efforts to restore environmental conditions and improve land use planning.

Description of Project Activities: Knowing the effects that beavers have on their environment, it was believed that selective translocation of these animals into degraded watersheds would have beneficial effects on water quality, watershed health, and riparian wildlife habitat. Selective relocation was necessary, since not every site had the potential to sustain the animals during the crucial initial stages of the reintroduction. Beginning with a small remnant population, practitioners began moving beavers to stream areas where there was already abundant food (mostly willows), but where the stream channel was incised and didn't carry water year round--though some water, with a few relatively deep pools, was necessary in order to give the beavers a safe habitat. 

Beavers are selected from a site where they are reproducing well and where their local population is stable. In some cases, they have also been taken from areas where farmers or other land users report excessive damage or other problems such as blocked irrigation lines or access to fields. They are moved during the early spring, before litters are born, or late in the summer, when the kits are grown and are relatively independent. Only rarely are they moved in winter because the animals would then lack sufficient time to build either a lodge or bank den (both types of shelters are used here) or to develop a food pile big enough to last through the season.

Practitioners employ wire snares made from 3/32 in aircraft cable, which is closed into a loop through a one-way lock mechanism that tightens on the animals as they pull against it. When properly placed, these snare loops are approximately 10 inches in diameter, with the bottom suspended 2 inches off the ground. The loose end of the snare is secured with additional wire to any sturdy object such as a tree or rock, or in some cases a clump of firm vegetation. The loop should be large enough for the beaver to get its head and one limb through the opening (beavers have a wedge-shaped skull, which is very difficult to snare). In the past both cage traps and leg-hold traps have been used, but snares have been found to be more effective and far less expensive. They are placed along well-used trails or at sites where beavers come on land to feed. 

These runway and feeding sites usually have a tree large enough to secure the snare, and this method also traps the beaver on dry land where the possibility of drowning is minimized. Snares are occasionally placed along spillways on beaver dams and/or paths through aquatic vegetation, but these areas have the disadvantages of deep water (which could drown a beaver or make it difficult to disentangle) and of providing few places to fasten snares. 

With proper use and snare placement, mortality rates are approximately 5 percent or less. Mortalities generally occur when a beaver gets entangled in water deep enough to drown the animal or other beavers attack it while it is in the snare. Checking the traps every day minimizes both mortality and trauma from both of these causes.

Once a beaver is caught in a snare, it is held down firmly with a catch pole and lead into either a cage or large plastic or metal garbage can, where the snare is cut off. This often requires two people, but it can be done by one experienced handler. A garbage can is easier than a cage for one person to handle and has the advantage of protecting workers from bites. The cage works well when the animal needs to be transported a long distance or through rough country, where two people can carry it suspended from a pole or shovel handle. Most beavers behave aggressively when first approached in the snare, but calm considerably when confined. Ideally, the animals are released the same day they are caught, but they have been held as long as 48 hours without apparent ill effects to the animals. It is recommended that the animals be kept in a cook, dark, quiet place, as this keeps them calm and minimizes stress and possible complications (Day and others, 1980).

The project has relocated about 23 beavers in seven riparian rehabilitation areas on the Reservation. Between one and five beavers have been moved at a time, but approximately three are moved on average. A relatively high degree of success has been attained when releasing three or more beavers in the same area. Sub-adults seem more inclined to stay in a relocation area than adults with an already established territory. By moving beavers relatively far from their home territory or watercourse, the likelihood that they will return to the site from which they were trapped is minimized.

The characteristics sought in a release site are as follows: (1) at least some available water lasting into the early summer; (2) enough cattails and/or willows or other woody vegetation for the beavers to eat (though other projects have involved bringing food in for beavers until natural vegetation becomes established around ponds); and (3) an area that has the potential to provide the greatest benefit to wildlife--in other words, it is close to other suitable habitat or it was formerly high quality habitat. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: In most cases, within 1-2 weeks of their reintroduction, the beavers begin building dams and slowing the flow of water. Within one year, they generally will have created a well-established series of dams, which begins to salvage enough water to drop sediments out of suspension, raise the stream bed, and improve overall habitat. Surface water gradually spreads over a wider area, and larger and larger pools begin to remain year-round. Within three to five years, remarkable changes will be evident, including very large increases in available surface and subsurface water, more abundant riparian vegetation, and reduced erosion. The most significant changes are:

Improved Hydrology
Once plants get established, the cycle of reduced erosion and increased plant health becomes self-perpetuating. The plants trap more sediment, reduce erosion, and slow the flow of water, allowing it to percolate into the soil and raise the water table, which in turn increases the abundance and productivity of the plants.

Reduction of Salt Cedar Infestation
In some parts of the Reservation, an extensive salt-cedar eradication effort has been undertaken. While beavers unfortunately do not eat salt cedar, the raised water tables and ponds of surface water they create have killed salt cedar in some areas. Native willows and cottonwoods are much more tolerant of inundation. Other researchers (Everitt, 1980) have reported that salt cedar apparently does not do well under conditions of frequent or severe flooding, while native species such as cottonwood and willow thrive under these conditions.

Willow Flycatchers
One of the species that has benefited most from the beaver relocations is the southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus), federally listed as endangered in 1998. This small neotropical migrant is a riparian-obligate passerine, one of four recognized subspecies of the willow flycatcher. It nests in riparian areas and near wetlands and lakes where there is dense growth of willow and other riparian species, often with a scattered overstory such as cottonwood.

Before the beaver relocation program, the Reservation normally had from three to five flycatcher territories in use in a given year. In the last three years, singing males or pairs of flycatchers have established territories in at least five additional locations, all of them with active beaver dams. In one area the loss of a lake that was drained in order to repair the dam was offset by the presence of beaver dams and ponds adjacent to the flycatcher territories. The flycatchers have continued to breed successfully despite the loss of the lake water and, since the beavers became active, the yellow-billed cuckoo, a candidate for endangered species status, has been recorded in one of the areas for the first time.

In addition to these (and other) species of birds, the improved riparian habitat has benefited deer, elk, fish, and amphibians. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Not everyone has been a supporter of the beaver program from the start. Many farmers initially complained that the beaver dams were a nuisance and kept water from entering their fields. In 1996 the project got help from an unexpected source: a drought. During that summer, one of the driest in recent decades, many reaches of the Zuni River dried up, and some farmers had partial or total crop failure. One family, however, had great success by irrigating their fields directly from a series of beaver ponds with the aid of a portable pump. This helped convince many families that beavers could in fact provide benefits to farmers.

In other areas, where the river channel is relatively shallow and the arable land extends to near the river, the rising water behind the beaver dams has encroached on farm fields and pastures. While most farmers are glad to have the extra water, some are concerned about the loss of fields (some of which have been handed down for many generations) when these areas are flooded. At one farm near one of the relocation sites, two pastures that were separated by a small dirt road and a culvert through which the Zuni River passed have become a 50-acre wetland with year-round water, fish, waterfowl, willow flycatchers, yellow-billed cuckoo, and snipe (a rare breeder in New Mexico) during the breeding season. There is a reluctance to remove the beavers from the habitat they have created, and practitioners are currently working with this farmer to find an adequate road crossing and access to his far pastures.

Another problem that has been encountered is the fact that the beavers will cut down most of the large trees in an area where they become especially abundant. Some areas look as though they've been hit by a cyclone, with cottonwood trees strewn everywhere, both in and out of the channel. In former times, beavers may have migrated to other areas once their habitat was so altered, allowing it to recover; however, with the limited habitat available in Zuni, there is a need to protect the trees that remain. To do this, the trunks of some trees are covered with sheets of aluminum. Used 16"" x 32"" aluminum printing plates are obtained from a local newspaper and then utilized for this purpose. They are de-inked with lacquer thinner, and then one to four sheets are nailed on the trunk from ground level up to 32 inches. Other projects have used chicken wire and steel screen to protect trees from beavers. While perhaps visually unappealing, these methods are quite effective at preventing beavers from cutting these protected trees.

One reintroduction site appeared to have ideal habitat in an incised arroyo with a relative abundance of water. However, the site was adjacent to an earthen dam that impounds a 50-acre lake. The one beaver introduced here soon made its way into the lake and began excavating a bank den in the earthen dam, damaging the dam and the road atop it.

One persistent problem that has been encountered is how to treat smaller arroyos that have little vegetation. In an evaluation of the causes of siltation of a critical wetland in the Upper Nutria Watershed, a single arroyo was found to contribute 96 percent of the sediment that was deposited, despite the fact that the area drained by the arroyo was only 16 percent of the watershed area. Transplanting beavers into these areas has proven to be problematic when there is not enough vegetation to serve as a reliable food source for the animals. In these cases, some initial planting of willows prior to reintroduction may be needed. That being said, the project has had success transplanting beavers into arroyos that have barely enough water to keep a few small ponds filled year-round, so permanent water is not strictly a necessity.
Beavers provide an excellent and portable educational tool. Some of the project’s beavers have visited classrooms from kindergarten through high school. They provide an avenue for teaching about wetlands, watchable wildlife, watershed health, and the activities of the Zuni Fish and Wildlife Department in general. It has become clear through this effort how much people’s (especially children’s) perceptions about the natural world depend on their immediate experience: kids become more transfixed and enchanted by this native rodent in their classroom or behind their houses than they do watching Siberian tigers or panda bears behind metal bars on a trip to the Albuquerque Zoo. Many classes have also been taken out into the field to see, walk on and explore beaver dams and lodges. This is an especially useful exercise, since the kids can readily see the difference that the animals make in their environment. The beaver reintroduction program is part of a larger, ongoing restoration effort that employs a number of other methods and approaches (e.g. elimination of invasive species, revegetation, grazing exclusion). It his hoped that the improvements in hydrology brought about by the beavers will compliment these other activities. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/india-the-attappady-wasteland-comprehensive-environmental-conservation-project-in-kerala/	India: The Attappady Wasteland Comprehensive Environmental Conservation Project in Kerala	India	1996-12-18	2009-12-18	"The Attappady region of Kerala has experienced severe ecological degradation stemming from a number of sources and now exhibits the largest extension of wasteland in the state. The progressive loss of vegetation, erosion of exposed topsoil, decline in soil fertility and scarcity of water resources has seriously jeopardized local livelihoods and given rise to a situation in which more than 80% of the population lived below the poverty line at the beginning of the 1990s. It was under these circumstances that the Attappady Wasteland Comprehensive Environmental Conservation Project (AWCECOP) was begun in 1996 with the objective of halting the processes of ecological and social deterioration and improving the economic base of the affected communities. The AWCECOP has been conducted by the Attappady Hills Area Development Society (AHADS) using models of participatory eco-restoration and sustainable resource management, and has been quite successful at mobilizing local community members and fostering dramatic improvements in the state of the forest ecosystem. It is hoped that, through this project, the trend of degradation will be replaced by an ethic of stewardship, and the local people will develop the capacity to effectively manage the resources vital for their survival.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The process of deforestation began in Attappady in the 1950s with the influx of migrants from Tamil Nadu and neighboring districts of Kerala. By the 1970s, it had reached alarming proportions, and forest area in Attappady had declined from 82% of the total geographic area in 1959 to 28% in 1971. Massive encroachment over forest and cultivated lands, introduction of unsustainable cropping systems, and excessive grazing inflicted heavy damage on the ecosystem and the livelihood support systems of the people. Due to deforestation of the catchments, perennial rivers dried up, springs disappeared and water quality worsened considerably, leading to a series of diseases, ill health and starvation among the region’s tribal inhabitants. Furthermore, the extensive felling of trees and the tilling of slopes with bullock-driven ploughs led to increased soil erosion and rainwater runoff, sedimentation of streams and rivers, and depletion of the groundwater. Subsequent changes in the structural and chemical properties of the soil gradually altered overall land use patterns and gave rise to even more unsustainable practices such as the manufacture of bricks with the thin topsoil that remained (Karat, 2003). The extent of soil erosion in Attappady is now one of the highest in the state. ecological restoration of degraded wastelands of Attappady and development of replicable models of participatory eco-restoration, so as to prevent further degradation and promote a sustainable model of livelihood for the local people (with special emphasis on the tribal population) and in harmony with the resource base.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Restoration activities were planned and implemented using a participatory approach on a watershed basis. The area’s two major river basins, the Bhavani and Bharatapuzha, were sub-divided into 15 watersheds and 146 micro watersheds (with no consideration given to state administrative boundaries) (IRMA, 2004). A User Association (UA) was then organized to represent the total population of a given micro watersheds. UAs include both tribal and non-tribal people and are primarily responsible for implementing project activities outlined in micro plans prepared by the Attappady Hill Area Development Society (AHADS) with the participation of local people. Out of 146 micro watersheds, only 93 have human inhabitants, and UAs were formed in all of these 93 micro watersheds. The executive Committee of a UA has nine elected members, and elections have been held every two years. In order to ensure the equal participation of tribal people and women in the committee, the following norms were instituted (AHADS, 2004): (a) out of the two positions- the president and secretary, one post should be held by a tribal person; (b) out of the four positions- the president, the vice-president, the secretary and the treasurer, at least one position should be held by a woman; (c) out of the nine members, at least five members should be women and four members from the tribal group.
UAs were found to be too large to address all the needs of their respective constituencies; therefore, Local Action Groups (LAG) were organized for project implementation at the local level as a representative body of all the beneficiaries within an area of 0.5-1.0(km)2 in a micro watershed. This group is responsible for the coordination of various activities to be undertaken on these lands, including the employment of labour.
Ooru Vikasana Samiti (OVS) is an un-registered organization in each tribal hamlet created to address the common issues of these marginalized communities. OVS have been formed in 160 of the 188 tribal hamlets. In order to ensure the participation of women, five of the nine elected members of each hamlet are supposed to be women.
A Joint Forest Management Committee (JFMC) is an unregistered organization formed for the reforestation of degraded forest lands located near human habitations. All adults in the neighborhood were eligible to become members of a JFMC. At present, 29 JFMCs have been formed. Each committee has a president, vice president, treasurer and five executive members based on elections. The post of secretary is held by staff of the AHADS. In order to ensure the participation of women and tribal people, executive committees were formed such that, out of the eight executive members, five were to be women and five were to be from the tribal community, irrespective of their gender (Karun et al., 2005).

Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: --Revegetation of Hills and Valleys--
As a result of project activities to date, forest regeneration works have been successfully carried out by JFMCs on more than 11,000 ha of state forestlands and private wastelands. Approximately seven million plants have been established on degraded and/or fallow lands of Attappady with a survival rate of 70% in forest areas and 62% on private lands. The growth of the planted stock has brought greenery back to the landscape, reduced surface runoff and improved the subsurface water regime. A study by Kerala University on the changes in land use patterns in Attappady between 2001 and 2005 substantiates the positive outcomes resulting from these revegetation efforts.

--Rejuvenation of Water Resources--
The combination of afforestation and soil and water conservation activities has fostered the rejuvenation of streams and watercourses throughout the region that had gone completely dry decades ago. The Kodungarapallam River, one of three major rivers in Attappady, provides an illustrative example of the notable achievements made by the project. 

Beginning in the early 1980s, the widespread degradation visited upon the forest ecosystem had dramatically altered the river's flow regime such that it carried water only during the rainy months of October and November. Watershed restoration measures implemented in the Kodungarapallam catchment area since 2002--including gully plugs and earthen barriers designed to enhance infiltration of rainwater-- have gradually augmented the aquifers that feed the river and have woken it from its slumber. It now flows year-round, carrying muddy runoff from the erratic showers into the Bhavani, a tributary of the Cauvery. 

A similar story is emerging in the case of the Varagar River, as well as other streams, such as Alamarapallam, Dhaliyarpallam, Uppungarapallam, Puliyapathi, etc. All of these watercourses have shown improved annual discharge levels. 

--Increased Groundwater Availability--
Hundreds of thousands of trenches, pits, and water retention and harvesting structures constructed over the project period have improved ground water availability. The dry wells of eastern Attappady have increased their water levels by anywhere from 5 to 40 feet. In a study conducted by Kerala University, it was found that in previously reported dry and semi-dry wells, the water availability has increased substantially from 7 to 37.8 cubic metres per day. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: A number of challenges have arisen since the project's inception. The following is a brief summary of the most notable among them. 

Because the project's implementation depends primarily on local skill and manpower, the availability of adequate labour becomes a constraint during the peak agricultural season, when the time and energy of local people is overwhelmingly dedicated to subsistence activities. This adversely affects the rate of progress achieved. 

Another limiting factor has been the conditional nature of the project's timeline. Because it is scheduled to run only until 2009-2010, experienced employees of AHADS are wont to seek more secure employment elsewhere. The consequent high turnover of staff has posed a challenge in terms of the project's efficiency and continuity.

The inadequate availability of raw materials for civil constructions in Attappady, and the high costs involved in transportation of materials to remote corners, slows down the pace of the project. Project works are executed by People's Institutions (PIs) based on estimates prepared in accordance with government-approved rates. Because the demand equation in terms of skilled man power and raw materials exceed local supply, there is a constant increase in the cost of civil construction. Therefore, many PIs are experiencing financial losses in the construction works they undertake, effectively slowing down the pace of implementation.

Interest groups related to the production and consumption of illicit liquor and ganja have acted as formidable challenges to people, especially the women's groups, and occasionally members of PIs have been harassed. Such incidents decelerate the social drive for the project.

Resistance has also been met from some settler farmers who are unhappy with the development activities of AHADS due to the fact that the wages given by AHADS are higher than local rates. They complain that the increase in wage rate and non-availability of labourers to work in their field threatens the sustenance of agricultural activities in Attappady. 

Owing to a long, sad history of alienation and encroachment by outsiders on tribal lands, many tribal inhabitants of Attappady have deep-rooted fears about lending their land to any outside organization or government agency. These fears, coupled with incorrect information, have caused many families to abstain from undertaking revegetation efforts of their private wastelands, thus limiting the extent of the project's restoration successes.

Unfortunately, most of the income generating activities developed under the project failed. The broom making unit, for instance, was stopped due to the labour union and vested interest of the traders. Tribal people were selling brooms through middlemen, and once AHADS had taken up this activity, the influence of middlemen was reduced. The formation of grassroots organizations totally diminished the role of contractors, creating great opposition to project activities in many cases.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Improved land value
Since the outset of the project in 1996, land value has increased from 10-30% in the project area. 

Overcoming drought 
Attappady experienced a severe drought in the year 2002. Even as the drought adversely influenced the agrarian society and economy of Attappady, the employment opportunities generated through the project helped local communities face the ordeal with ease.

Just wages
When AHADS began implementation of the project, the daily wage rate prevailing in Atappady, especially in eastern Attappady, was as low as 30 to 50 rupees. AHADS has established and ensured a just wage rate of 80 to120 rupees through the People's Institutions. Efforts are currently being made to enhance the daily wage rate further to Rs. 125 for both men and women, in accordance with the wages provided under the Employment Guarantee Programme of the Panchayaths.

Abolition of starvation deaths
Starvation deaths were reported from Vellakulam hamlet in the year 1999, before the field implementation of the project started. However, no such incidents have been reported during the project period, which is attributed to the availability of year long employment for the local people, especially the tribals.

Malnutrition 
Diseases related to malnutrition were prevalent in Attappady in the past. A health survey in 51 hamlets covering 2,051 families in the year 1999 had reported 437 cases of anemia. However reports from health care centers testify considerable reduction in such cases today.

Farming crisis and suicide of farmers 
The crisis in the farming sector has led some farmers to commit suicide at places like Wayanad, Idukki and Palakkad in Kerala. However, project activities have been instrumental in helping the people of Attappady to face the farming sector crisis with equanimity. 

Employment 
The project has so far generated more than 3.45 million mandays of employment. These opportunities, in an area known for poverty and unemployment, have favorably influenced the socio-economic situation in Attappady.

Labour migration 
The widespread tendency of people from Attappady (mainly the tribal communities) to migrate to the plains of Kerala and Tamil Nadu in search of employment as wage labourers has declined considerably since the inception of the project. 

Leadership development 
More than 5000 people's representatives are leading 93 UAs, 166 OVSs, 54 JFMCs and 198 IGA groups. The opportunities to officiate responsible positions in these People's Institutions are in turn developing group and regional leadership among the local people. They are also exposed to administrative skills and finance management, which is being recognized by the three-tier Panchayths in the Government.

Disproportionate improvements?
In spite of the above improvements in the socio-economic landscape, some tribal leaders remain ambivalent about the long-term benefits of the project. According to one such leader, the tribals have gained only terms of wages and will fail to see lasting improvements in ecosystem services. Since most of the lands included in the restoration are in the upper reaches of the hills, the increased groundwater levels will ultimately benefit the lower elevations where lands are generally owned by non-tribals. In fact, according to some, the project has had a negligible impact on tribal lands overwhelmingly located on ridges.

Some of the tribals are apprehensive, fearing that as the project draws to an end, the lands of non-tribals will be better off in terms of soil condition and groundwater levels. This will enable them to continue their cultivation and will make the tribals dependent upon them once again for wages. To complicate matters further, the tribals will be denied their traditional access to forestlands--and, by extension, forest resources--under the new regulations evolved by the project. Already, the AHADS project has installed wire fences to deny the access of cattle to wastelands under plantation and regeneration, and some JFMC leaders say this has reduced the cattle population, particularly among tribals.
The Attappady Wasteland Comprehensive Environmental Conservation Project has been planned and implemented on a community level through grassroots organizations guided by the Attappady Hills Area Development Society. The impact of the reforestation programme, soil and water conservation works, agricultural improvement measures, and infrastructure and income generation activities have put the Attappady region on a path toward sustainable development. Results of the project thus far reflect progressive changes in the environment and substantial gains in the local economy through improvements to the biophysical resource base. Continuing collaboration among multi-disciplinary teams will facilitate the replication of the project’s tangible benefits in other development units.
The experiences gained through this project attest to the fact that environmental degradation can not be remedied without simultaneously addressing the socio-economic problems of the surrounding area. It is of critical importance to recognize the inextricable link between ecosystem services, local economies, access to education, and the availability of basic infrastructure. These factors must all be taken into account in order to implement a successful restoration program. The implementation of diverse project activities has created significant employment opportunities and has thereby improved local livelihoods. However, the sustainability of the project in the long term is still under question, as very low priority has been given to income generating activities (only 0.34% of the total budget). If the project does not generate enough benefits to off-set the costs of construction and maintenance, it will clearly prove untenable. More attention must therefore be given to developing these sources of income, particularly the plantation of tree crops and the various initiatives begun under the IGA (Income Generating Activity) groups.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/argentina-restauracion-de-bosques-y-agroecologia-en-el-corredor-verde-de-la-provincia-de-misiones/	Argentina: Restauración de Bosques y Agroecología en el Corredor Verde de la Provincia de Misiones	Argentina	2002-12-12	2008-12-12	"Dado su extraordinario valor ecológico y su crítico estado de conservación, el Bosque Atlántico del Alto Paraná es considerado de alta prioridad de conservación a escala regional y global. La ONG Conservación Argentina impulsa desde el año 2002 un proyecto de conservación en el corredor biológico de Misiones entre los parques provinciales Urugua-í y Horacio Foerster. El proyecto busca mantener y restaurar una conexión de selva entre ambas unidades protegidas con el objetivo de evitar el aislamiento de las áreas y la extinción de la fauna y flora nativas. Para ello, Conservación Argentina viene implementando experiencias de restauración de selva que permitan aumentar la conectividad ecológica de la región y desarrollando sistemas agroforestales que integran los cultivos agrícolas con la plantación de árboles, tales como los cultivos bajo cubierta, cortinas forestales, plantaciones mixtas y bosques de frutales. Además de estas actividades, se ha lanzado un programa de educación ambiental con la meta de capacitar a los diversos actores de la región y lograr una mayor participación e interacción con las instituciones locales y regionales involucradas en las iniciativas de conservación. Mientras que los trabajos arriba mencionados han sido muy exitosos, quizás el logro más importante del proyecto hasta la fecha sea la cooperación entre Conservación Argentina, Fundación Vida Silvestre Argentina y el gobierno de Misiones para comprar y proteger tres chacras contiguas ubicadas en el corredor. Estas tierras serán rehabilitadas y reforestadas y aumentarán el área de hábitat transicional entre los dos parques.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation La eco-región del Bosque Atlántico (Mata Atlántica para los brasileros) se extiende a través de la costa atlántica de Brasil y continúa hacia el centro del cono sur, alcanzando el este de Paraguay y el norte de Argentina. Históricamente ocupaba 1 millón de kilómetros cuadrados, pero en la actualidad existe únicamente en forma de parches aislados, los cuales totalizan menos del 10% del tamaño original. La pérdida y degradación del bosque ha causado la desaparición del 93% del Bosque Atlántico en Brasil, del 80% en Paraguay y del 56% en Argentina (Galindo-Leal y Camara 2003); y éste está presente principalmente como remanentes aislados esparcidos a lo largo de un paisaje dominado por los usos agrícolas y foresto-industriales (Galindo-Leal y Camara 2003).
La expansión de la frontera agrícola, los grandes monocultivos forestales exóticos, los proyectos hidroeléctricos y la ganadería extensiva presionan sobre la viabilidad a largo plazo de los bosques remanentes en esta ecorregión. Actualmente este problema amenaza la integridad de los ecosistemas en la cuenca del Urugua-í, abarcando varias áreas protegidas del corredor ecológico trinacional. Algunas especies están probablemente extintas (ej. Pato Serrucho y el Maracaná) (Chebez 1994), y en otros casos, las poblaciones remanentes están siendo fragmentadas o sufriendo una rápida reducción de su abundancia (ej. Tapir). Los conocimientos que nos brindan la genética de poblaciones, la teoría de dinámica metapoblacional y la teoría de biogeografía de islas (Meffe y Carroll 1997) sugieren que en el largo plazo las poblaciones pequeñas y aisladas tendrán bajas probabilidades de supervivencia. La Selva Misionera presenta un gradiente de hábitats naturales, desde bisques bajos con abundancia de cañas (en la región del arroyo Uruzú) hasta asociaciones de palmitos (Euterpe edulis) y palo rosa (Aspidosperma polyneuron) en las mesetas de la Sierra de la Victoria, encontrándose algunos relictos de pino paraná (Araucaria angustifolia) en la región sudeste (Bertolini y Gil 1999). Esta diversidad de asociaciones vegetales explica la alta riqueza de vertebrados, incluyendo varios endemismos del Bosque Atlántico. Nueves especies de aves y ocho de mamíferos presentes en el área se consideran como amenazadas a nivel global (Collar et al. 1992, IUCN 2004, Birdlife, 2004), mientras 15 especies son consideradas amenazadas a nivel nacional (SAREM 2000).
Las asociaciones de palmito representan una fuente de alimento para muchas aves (zorzales, pavas de monte y tucanes) y mamíferos (pecarí labiado y tapir) que necesitan desplazarse grandes distancias en busca de alimento. Por lo tanto, los palmitos podrían ser considerados como “especies clave” dentro de este ecosistema, productores sincronizados de frutos comestibles para la fauna silvestre durante las épocas de escasez de otros frutos (Placci et al. 1992, Keuroghlian et al. 2001). Implementar experiencias de agroecología y reforestación con especies nativas para consolidar y mantener una conexión boscosa entre los Parques Urugua-í y Foerster que aumente la integridad ecológica del área para la fauna nativa y asegure la diversidad de especies y la diversidad genética de las poblaciones.
Involucrar a las comunidades e instituciones locales en la conservación del corredor através de programas educativos, prácticas agroforestales y actividades de restauración y así mejorar la calidad de vida de los chacareros de la región.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
La mayoría de las áreas protegidas en Misiones están amenazadas debido a su aislamiento y la ausencia de zonas buffer. Uno de los factores agravantes principales es la falta de compromiso de las comunidades vecinas en asuntos de conservación. Por consiguiente, la implementación de un programa educativo de conservación es crucial para asegurar la conectividad entre los Parques Urugua-í y Foerster. Se cree que es necesario promover un cambio en la actitud y el comportamiento de la población local hacia el medio ambiente y se han identificado tres grupos de actores clave: Maestros, guardaparques y líderes locales; Niños de escuelas locales y aulas satélites; y Productores locales o colonos. Para llevar a cabo estos cambios a largo plazo, es necesario trabajar en conjunto con los actores locales que pueden transmitir los valores e ideas de conservación a otros miembros de la comunidad. Dentro del Corredor Urugua-í – Foerster este rol es cumplido por los maestros, guardaparques y líderes locales. Por ello se concentran los esfuerzos de capacitación en este público. Se considera que los efectos multiplicadores a largo plazo de su trabajo en el área son cualitativa y cuantitativamente más amplios que los efectos puntuales que pudieran derivarse del trabajo con otros agentes locales, y que ellos serán quienes, con el acompañamiento de los demás miembros del equipo, continúen el trabajo con los actores locales restantes (niños y colonos). Varios talleres se han organizado para entrenar maestros y guardaparques del Corredor, juntos con personal de otras instituciones colaboradoras públicas y privadas, sobre educación para la conservación e interpretación de la naturaleza. Se han brindado también oportunidades educativas para jóvenes de la zona, quienes han participado en algunas investigaciones y han desarrollado proyectos originales para complementar las iniciativas en curso.

Description of Project Activities: --Mantenimiento de un Vivero de Arboles Nativos--
Desde 2002, Conservación Argentina mantiene un vivero de especies nativas, localizado en una de las chacras del corredor (ver Rey et al. 2003). Durante esta etapa del proyecto, el vivero estuvo produciendo plantines constantemente, los cuales fueron utilizados en experiencias agroforestales y de restauración implementadas dentro del corredor Urugua-í - Foerster. El vivero tiene la capacidad de producir 50,000 plantines al año y contiene más de 50 especies nativas.

Con el objeto de autosostener los costos de manejo del vivero, se han vendido plantines a otras instituciones que los han utilizado en tareas de investigación y en proyectos de restauración. Esto facilita el mantenimiento a largo plazo del vivero forestal y se permite ofrecer plantines en forma gratuita a los agricultores y las ecuelas del corredor. Como consecuencia de estas actividades, el vivero de este proyecto ya es un vivero de referencia en la región norte de Misiones.

--Parcelas Agroforestales Piloto--
Basado en la experiencia previa de Conservación Argentina se seleccionó un número reducido de granjas en las cuales se comprobaron la aprobación, el compromiso y el interés constante del propietario. Se ha trabajado con estos agricultores en el establecimiento de experiencias agroecológicas que puedan ser usadas como ejemplo a seguir por parte de otros agricultores. Los experimentos agroforestales y de restauración en áreas claves identificadas fueron conducidas dentro de estas granjas.)

En una de las chacras del corredor se ha establecido una parcela agroforestal experimental. La parcela consiste en un cuarto de hectárea que se localiza en una pastura que ha sido utilizada durante más de 15 años. El ganado fue excluido del área con una cerca de alambre y se preparó el suelo con un tractor. El objetivo fue experimentar con un sistema agroforestal sucesional (GÁ¶tsch 1995, Peneireiro 1999, Vaz 2001). Durante el experimento no se usaron agroquímicos ni manejos agrícolas conflictivos con los principios agroecológicos.

Se estableció un sistema altamente diverso, con numerosas especies nativas y cultivadas, incluyendo las de uso múltiple (leña, alimento, medicinas, abono verde). Se plantaron 2200 plantines de más de 60 árboles de especies nativas. La parcela completa fue cubierta con cultivos de maíz y porotos para mantener los suelos cubiertos. A medida que las plantas crecían se sumaron nuevos cultivos y árboles al sistema, incluyendo otras especies forestales, melones, zapallos, bananas, mango, palta, mandarina, diferentes variedades de porotos y abono verde. 

El año 2004 fue uno de los más secos de las últimas decadas, lo que incrementó notablemente la mortalidad de los plantines. Sin embargo, los cultivos ""en callejones"", como los de maíz, ofrecieron sombra suficiente para minimizar el daño causado por la sequía.

A fines de 2005, aún cuando los plantines estaban en crecimiento, ya se observaba un aumento en la diversidad de plantas y animales (Ej: cueva de mulita). Esta parcela parece estar ya trabajando como un trampolín que favorece la conectividad en el corredor.

Durante el Taller Agroforestal que se organizó en noviembre 2005, la parcela experimental fue visitada por técnicos y otros participantes que ofrecieron útiles consejos y sugerencias, que fueron incorporadas en el manejo del experimento. 

--Experiencias de Restauración--
Se implantaron experimentos de restauración en áreas convertidas en pasturas. El ganado fue excluido selectivamente en ciertas áreas pequeñas para permitir la regeneración natural (control); se implementaron técnicas de plantación para atraer animales dispersores de semillas y así estimular la regeneración. En las áreas de exclusión se plantaron árboles pioneros, productores de frutas carnosas, como disparadores del proceso de regeneración. Se espera que estas parcelas de restauración trabajen como ""Islas de Biodiversidad"" las cuales cumplirán la función de trampolines, proveyendo refugio y facilitando el movimiento de las especies (aves, árboles, insectos polinizadores e incluso mamíferos) a través de campos abiertos (Bennet 1999, Forman 1995). El objeto de estas experiencias es promover la conectividad funcional entre remanentes forestales clave en un paisaje dominado por pasturas.

En pasturas que pertenecen al establecimiento rural San Sebastián de la Selva, se realizó la primera experiencia de reaturación de bosque ripario native en el Corredor Urugua-í - Foerster, la cual es la primera en su tipo en el noreste de Misiones. El mismo se desarrolló como el proyecto final de uno de los estudiantes de la Escuela de la Familia Agrícola (EFA) de Andresito, al cual se asesoró técnica y económicamente. 

El área a restaur pertenece a la cuenca del arroyo Guavirá-mí. Este arroyo corre desde un bosque secundario localizado dentro de la misma propiedad y se continúa hacia el este aguas arriba dentro del Parque Provincial Foerster y aguas abajo en el arroyo Guavirá. Este último cruza el corredor de sur a norte y el arroyo Guavirá-mí es uno de sus tributarios de su cuenca oriental. En este lado de la cuenca el bosque nativo a lo largo de sus orillas fue cortado hace unos 15 años y se destinaron las tierras a cría de ganado. De este modo, aún cuando la cuenca occidental permanece forestada, la conectividad local ha sido interrumpida. 

La cría de ganado afectó la estructura de la planicie de inundación y la dinámica del curso de agua: en sus bajadas al arroyo, el ganado llevó sedimentos que llenaron parte del cauce y rompió la paredes del valle, el agua desapareció del curso en los períodos secos y han ocurrido deslizamientos laterales de tierra debido a la falta de raices de árboles protegiendo los suelos. 

Con el fin de restablecer los servicios ambientales provistos por el bosque ripario y la conectividad entre las áreas protegidas cercanas se propuso la restauración de la selva en galería.

Se cercaron 2.5 hectáreas de la cuenca, ubicando el alambrado a 10 metros del curso de agua y entrando 30 metros dentro de la selva. Luego se plantaron 750 plantines de 15 diferentes especies nativas obtenidas del vivero forestal. Se usaron 120 individuos de tres especies de árboles para estudiar su tasa de crecimiento y supervivencia en la planicie aluvial y en la pendiente del valle, donde se midió su altura y el diámetro a la base con el objeto de monitorear estos atributos en los años siguientes. Esta área restaurada será utilizada por los nuevos proyectos generados en la EFA. Ya se ha planeado monitorear esta experiencia y la regeneración natural en las parcelas

--Apoyo para Experiencias de Productores Locales--
Desde 2004 Conservación Argentina está apoyando el desarrollo de una nueva experiencia agroforestal en el corredor, llevada a cabo por otra ONG local llamada ""Selvas para Siempre"". Esta iniciativa quiere demostrar que son posibles alternativas de producción diversificacdas sin el uso de agroquímicos y también busca restaurar los bosques nativos dentro del corredor.

CA apoyó esta iniciativa facilitando más de 15.000 plantines de árboles nativos que han sido utilizados en restauración y prácticas agroforestales. Hoy, la chacra utilizada en esta experiencia ya ha desarrollado su propio pequeño vivero forestal. También se han entregado plantines a más de una docena de chacras dentro del corredor para reforestar con especies nativas. Algunos agricultores han comenzado a hacer plantaciones mixtas con especies nativas dentro de sus propiedades.

--Estudios de Biodiversidad--
Generalmente la implementación de corredores biológicos no se basa en conocimientos científicos y como resultado no siempre resulta clara su utilizada para el movimiento de especies. Durante 2002 se implementó un programa de anillado dentro del corredor entre los Parques Provinciales Urugua-í y H. Foerster. Los objetivos de este programa fueron: 1) identificar áreas clave a lo largo del corredor para el movimiento de aves entre las áreas protegidas; 2) involucrar habitantes locales en la investigación científica; 3) actualizar el listado de aves de los Parques Provinciales Urugua-í y H. Foerster.

Después de tres años de monitorear aves, se ha acumulado una gran cantidad de información para identificar rutas importantes para el movimiento de aves entre las áreas protegidas y para seleccionar las áreas clave para restauración y protección del bosque dentro del corredor. También ha probado ser una herramienta válida para involucrar a jóvenes locales en actividades de conservación.

Además de los estudios de avifauna, Conservación Argentina también está desarrollando una guía de campo de árboles del Bosque Atlántico del Alto Paraná. Esta guía se tornará un material de referencia para muchos estudios conducidos en el área y una herramienta para inventarios de biodiversidad llevados a cabo por guardaparques y parataxónomos. 
Economic vitality and local livelihoods: El enfoque para la conservación que utiliza este proyecto se basa en la premisa según la cual promover la plantación y la utilización de árboles de usos múltiples dentro del corredor dará valor económico a los recursos y colaborará en la conservación del Bosque Atlántico y su biodiversidad. Las prácticas agroforestales son una importante herramienta en el mantenimiento de la biodiversidad local y en la mejora de la productividad agrícola en los trópicos (Anderson 1990, Lambeck 1997, Cullen et al. 2001, Burkart et al. 2002, GÁ¶tz Schroth et al 2004). Otros beneficios indirectos de las técnicas agroforestales incluyen: control de vientos, cercos vivos, protección de impactos de las lluvias y la erosión, y como barrera contra enfermedades y pestes. Se desea implementar este tipo de técnicas en algunas chacras clave, ayudando en el desarrollo de una mentalidad agrícola orientada a la agroecología entre los agricultores locales del corredor Urugua-í  -  Foerster. Una visión agroforestal ayudará a armonizar las necesidades sociales y ambientales de la región.
El uso de corredores en la conservación busca brindar una solución práctica y efectiva al problema de mantener la biodiversidad y los procesos ecológicos a gran escala. Las áreas protegidas existentes a menudo son muy pequeñas y aisladas como para mantener especies y ecosistemas viables. En tales circunstancias los esfuerzos de conservación se deben focalizar en conectar sitios importantes a lo largo de amplias áreas geográficas. Tales redes de áreas protegidas y sistemas de manejo de paisaje se denominan por corredores de biodiversidad (Bennett 1999). La principal función de estos corredores es conectar áreas ricas en biodiversidad a través de un mosaico de tierras de uso sustentable, aumentando la movilidad y el intercambio genético entre individuos, aún en ausencia de grandes extensiones de hábitats naturales continuos (Forman 1995). La intervención a gran escala a través de los corredores de biodiversidad, la planificación ecoregional y la conservación del paisaje, es una de las más altas prioridades de conservación a nivel regional en muchos de los “hotspots” y áreas naturales del mundo.
Se considera que la adquisición de áreas pequeñas pero críticas debe ser considerada en los proyectos de conservación. La conservación a largo plazo de nuevas áreas protegidas debería basarse tanto en el compromiso gubernamental como de las comunidades locales. Un fuerte trabajo de educación y capacitación es necesario para crear este compromiso y asegurar la participación y apoyo de los pequeños productores con respecto a nuevos rumbos en la gestión de áreas naturales.
La compra de tierras privadas debe ser menejada con sumo cuidado en relación con la comunidad local. Debe evitarse el sentimiento de ser “expulsados de sus tierras” por gente foránea o por el gobierno, conduciendo un fuerte programa educativo y difundiendo la información correcta. Si la comunidad local no es incorporada en el manejo del área protegida desde el principio se vería amenazada su conservación a largo plazo. El trabajo llevado a cabo durante la primera etapa del proyecto (2002-2003) generó información de alta calidad que fue usada en el diseño de importantes recomendaciones de conservación para el gobierno provincial y ONGs locales.
La principal recomendación fue proteger el mayor remanente forestal que áun conecta ambas áreas protegidas en el corredor. Este área está ocupada por una chacra de 207 has y de dos a cuatro lotes pequeños (de 15-30 has cada uno). Se aconsejó que se buscaran fondos de UICN-Holanda o FFI-Arcadia Fund para la compra de estas tierras estratégicas para mantener la conectividad. Estas recomendaciones fueron propuestas principalmente al gobierno a través del Ministerio de Ecología, RNR y Turismo de la provincia de Misiones, y a la Fundación Vida Silvestre Argentina (FVSA), socia de WWF y una de las principales ONGs conservacionistas de Argentina.
En agosto de 2004 se recibió una llamada de la oficina regional de FVSA para presenter un proyecto conjunto para la compra de esas tierras a UICN-Holanda. FVSA y CA escribieron juntos una propuesta, que finalmente fue presentada en octubre. En diciembre el proyecto fue seleccionado por UICN para ser adjudicado con los fondos requeridos, los cuales serían administrados por FVSA. La propuesta consiste en la compra de 3 chacras estratégicas para segurar la conectividad del corridor Uruguaí – Foerster mediante la creación de un área protegida privada manejada por Conservación Argentina, crear un plan de manejo y construir la infraestructura necesaria para la reserva (centro de visitantes, casa de guardaparque, caminos, carteles). Estas tierras están próximas al establecimiento ecoturístico San Sebastián de la Selva, en donde se estableció la estación biológica de CA.
Con el objetivo de comprar las tierras y crear el área protegida ya mencionada, CA y FVSA se reunieron con el Ministerio de Ecología de Misiones. Se cooperó entre las tres instituciones para llevar a cabo esta propuesta, evitar conflictos sociales y garantizar la sustentabilidad a largo plazo del área. Como uno de los resultados las tres acordaron comanejar el área (gobierno provincial-ONGs).
En 2005 el gobernador de Misiones firmó un decreto para la creación de una nueva área de conservación: el corredor entre los parques provincials Urugua-í y Foerster, incluyendo las tierras arriba mencionadas. Técnicas de restauración y agroforestales se usarán para recuperar tierras deforestadas dentro de esta reserva.
Con miras a estas actvidades venideras, CA planea lo siguiente:
Crear una red de puntos de monitoreo de aves a lo largo del Corredor Verde de Misiones que provea información significativa sobre las tendencias de las poblaciones de aves a escala regional y que sea utilizada como una herramienta educativa para estudiantes de la carrera de guardaparques y otros habitantes locales.
Incorporar en el equipo un capacitador de campo que se relacione con un pequeño grupo de colonos del corredor con quienes divulgue los principios de la agroecología y los sistemas agroforestales en la comunidad.
Crear un centro de extensión agroecológica en el corredor que será utilizado como lugar de reuniones, entrenamiento y experimentación para pequeños productores rurales de la región.
Publicar un manual técnico sobre agroecología y sistemas agroforestales. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/ecuador-restauracion-del-manglar-de-muisne-en-la-provincia-de-esmeraldas/	Ecuador: Restauración del Manglar de Muisne en la Provincia de Esmeraldas	Ecuador	2003-05-04	2004-06-04	"Desde los años ochentas, la camaronicultura ha provocado la deforestación de áreas extensas de manglar en la costa de Ecuador. En el estuario del río Muisne, una zona de alta biodiversidad en la provincia de Esmeraldas, se ha perdido más del 80% de la cobertura de manglares, disminuyendo no sólo la extensión y cohesión del hábitat sino también la base económica para la población cercana que depende de actividades pesqueras y recolectoras. En mayo de 2003, la Fundación de Defensa Ecológica (FUNDECOL) inició un programa de restauración con el fin de recuperar la dinámica del ecosistema mediante la rehabilitación de algunos sitios deforestados y la reintegración en el bosque de varias piscinas camaroneras abandonadas. Para asegurar el apoyo de las comunidades locales y por ende el éxito del proyecto a largo plazo, se solicitó la ayuda y colaboración de varias asociaciones de usarios del manglar, dándose charlas educativas para promover la conservación del ecosistema y el manejo sostentable de los recursos forestales e involucrando los mismos usarios en las actividades de siembra y la vigilancia de áreas protegidas.Deforestation, Fisheries & Aquaculture La crisis del banano en la década de los setentas y la instalación de piscinas camaroneras en los años ochentas provocó la deforestación tanto de bosques como de manglares de la zona (Navarrete 2002b). Originalmente, los manglares del río Muisne tenían una extensión que superaba las 20.000 ha, pero a raíz de la implementación de piscinas para la cría y cultivo de camarón tropical en la década de los ochentas, se perdió cerca de 85% (17.000 ha) de los manglares.
Otro factor dañino en el último decenio es la expansión en la zona sur de Esmeraldas de los monocultivos de una variedad de eucalipto tropical que se utiliza para la producción y exportación de papel. Esta siembra extensiva pone en riesgo el aprovisionamiento de agua de las comunidades cercanas a las plantaciones, deteriora el suelo y arrasa con la biodiversidad de los bosques que reemplaza (Paredes 2005). En un informe de la ONG EcoCostas consta que en Muisne existen unas 10,000 hectáreas de plantaciones dispersas de eucalipto. Este sector de Esmeraldas mantiene una de las extensiones de manglar más importantes del país, que incluye seis especies de mangles–Mangle pava (Rhizophora harrisonii), Mangle rojo (Rhizophora mangle), Mangle blanco (Laguncularia racemosa), Mangle negro (Avicennia germinans), Mangle piñuelo (Pelliciera rhizophorae), Mangle botón (Conocarpus erectus), y Nato (Mora megistosperma).
Se estima que en el estuario del río Muisne habitan 253 especies, de las cuales 25 son mamíferos, 70 aves, 95 peces, 35 moluscos y 28 crustáceos; sin embargo, no se descarta la posibilidad de superar este número con mayores estudios en el área (Navarrete 2002a).
Se han identificado 25 especies de mamíferos y tres de ellas–cabeza de mate (Eira barbara), cuchucho (Nasua nasua) y oso perezoso (Bradypus variegatus)–están protegidas bajo las leyes del Estado ecuatoriano desde el 2000 (Navarrete 2002a; Tirira 2001). Además, el área es primordial como refugio para mamíferos amenazados en el ámbito nacional, tales como machín blanco de occidente (Cebus albifrons subsp. aequatorialis), aullador de la costa (Alouatta palliata), puma (Puma concolor), tigrillo chico (Leopardus tigrinus). Otras especies importantes son: venado (Mazama americana), nutria común (Lontra longicaudis), armadillo rabo de carne de occidente (Cabassous centralis), perezoso de dos uñas de occidente (Choloepus hoffmanni), oso hormiguero (Tamandua tetradactyla), armadillo de nueve bandas (Dasypus novemcinctus); (Freile y Santander 2005).
El manglar de Muisne es también el hábitat tanto de aves residentes como migratorias, que aproximadamente suman 70 especies. Las más vistosas y representativas son: martín pescador (Chloroceryle americana), águila tijereta (Elanoides forficatus), fragata mayor (Fregata magnificens), pelícano (Pelecanus occidentalis), garcilla (Bubulcus ibis), trogón ecuatoriano (Trogon mesurus), águila pescadora (Pandion haliaetus), halcón reidor (Herpetotheres cachinnans), loro cabeciazul (Pionus menstruus), carpintero lomirrojo (Veniliornis kirkii); (Paredes 2005; Navarrete 2002a). Tres especies de aves asociadas al manglar se encuentran amenazadas–Águila solitaria (Harpyhaliaetus solitarius), Tucán de Swainson (Ramphastos swainsonii), Rascón manglero (Rallus longirostris).
Se han reportado 95 especies de peces; 40 son de río y 45 de mar. Los peces de río más representativos del área son: chame (Dormitator latifrons), gualajo (Centropomus robalito), jurel (Caranx hippos), lenguado (Austroglossus pectoralis), pez volador picudo (Fodiator acutus rostratus), voladora paloma (Oligoplites altus), chavela café (Chaetodipterus zonatus), choca pintadita (Hyporhamphus unifasciatus). Además, existen otras especies que se alojan en las raíces del mangle y son típicos de mar, como: atún (Thunnus albacares), bacalao (Gadus morhua), sierra (Pristis microdon), dorado (Coryphaena hippurus) y lisa chureta (Mugil curema); (Navarrete 2002a).
En esta área se han registrado 35 especies de crustáceos; 18 presentes en ríos y 17 en mar. En el río es común encontrar langostinos (Penaeus vannemei, P. occidentalis, P. stylirostris, P. brevirostris, P. californiensis), cangrejos (Aratus pisonii, Goniapsis pulchea, Ucides occidentalis) y jaibas (Callinectes toxotes). No obstante, también hay otros crustáceos que se hospedan en las raíces del mangle y son característicos de mar: camarones (Palaemon hancocki), cangrejos (Uca stylifera, Panopeus purpureus, Eurypanopeus transversus) y tasqueros (Goniopsis pulcra, Sesarma occidentalis); (Navarrete 2002a).
Por último, se han identificado 28 especies de moluscos; 22 de río y 6 de mar. Los moluscos de río son: almeja (Donax dentifer), mejillón (Mytelia srigata), concha hembra (Anadara tuberculosa). Sin embargo, hay moluscos de mar que viven en el mangle, como: calamar (Logilo vulgaris) y mejillón común (Mytilus edulis); (Navarrete 2002a). Este proyecto se ha realizado con el fin de devolver las áreas degradadas a la dinámica del ecosistema manglar y así permitir en el mediano y largo plazo realizar tareas de aprovechamiento, tanto de moluscos, crustáceos y peces de valor alimenticio y comercial para las comunidades costeras a lo largo del sistema Muisne – Cojímies.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Durante el periodo que duro el proyecto y en especial los primeros meses, se visitaron las Asociaciones “Real Fortuna” del poblado Bilsa, “Requema” del barrio Santa Rosa, “El Progreso” del barrio la Florida, “Bellavista” del barrio Bellavista, “Progreso” de la parroquia San José de Chamanga y “Defensa del manglar” de Daule.
En las reuniones mantenidas se reafirmó la necesidad de recuperar las áreas deforestadas que aun quedan por restablecer y en especial las piscinas camaroneras abandonadas para de está manera incorporarlas en el menor tiempo posible a la producción de flora y fauna del ecosistema manglar y así poder llevar a cabo las actividades de recolección y pesca.
Através de estas reuniones, se dio a conocer el proyecto y se logró el compromiso de las asociaciones participantes para el restablecimiento de áreas degradadas.

Description of Project Activities: Dando inicio al proceso de la recuperación del manglar se procedió mediante recorridos por el estuario del río Muisne y el estuario del río Cojímies la ubicación de áreas deforestadas, piscinas camaroneras abandonadas y áreas ya reforestadas en proceso de crecimiento que por factores adaptativos y otros, requieren una resiembra mínima o considerable. Esto con el fin de reforestarlas con las especies a la que obedezcan dichas áreas, suelo y entorno; y así en el mediano y largo plazo devolverlas a la dinámica del ecosistema manglar.

Una vez establecidas las áreas a sembrar se procedió a la recolección de semillas de mangle rojo (Rhizophora mangle) y mangle negro (Avicennia Germinans); esto mediante recorridos por los diferentes esteros, se logró la recolección de plántulas en estado embrionario y de buena consistencia; de ellas, se procedió primero a escoger las mejores para luego sembrarlas en los semilleros ya establecidos con anterioridad a este proyecto, como son él del sector de Javillal y el Congal, sitios aptos para la normal germinación de los futuros propágulos y árboles de mangle.

Cabe indicar que los propágulos de mangle negro se obtuvieron directamente de semilleros naturales ubicados en el sector de Bilsa y Congal.

Las semillas aptas, es decir las que presentan una radícula en buen estado y coloración normal, consistencia vigorosa, ápice aceptable y tamaño entre 16 y 45 cm las de mangle rojo y entre 12 a 15 cm las de mangle negro.

Como resultado, y en respuesta a las 13,28 hectáreas sembradas, se recolectaron aproximadamente 29.000 semillas de las cuales se utilizaron para dicho fin 27.500 propágulos entre mangle rojo y mangle negro, que corresponden a las reforestaciones realizadas con medidas de 2,5 x 2,5 mt. y de 2 x 2 mt.

Cabe indicar que esta pre- siembra se la realiza acogiendo varios criterios técnicos que en el futuro van a incidir en el buen desarrollo de las respectivas plántulas de mangle.

Una vez cumplido el periodo de germinación de esta especie, la cual fluctúa entre 35 y 45 días calendario, tiempo recomendable para este fin, se procedió a extraer la cantidad de propágulos a utilizarse en la tarea de reforestación planificada.

Para dar seguridad al proceso con respecto al buen estado de las plántulas al momento de sembrarlas, se utilizó gavetas plásticas para el trasporte y de esta manera permitir el orden y fácil acarreo dentro de las áreas a sembrase.

Para el cumplimiento de esta valiosa actividad, se llevaron a cabo díez faenas distintas de siembra, que finalmente indican la siembra de 13,28 hectáreas de manglar entre las especies Rhizophora mangle y Avicennia germinans.

Con la finalidad de darle seguridad y permanencia a las reforestaciones realizadas desde el inicio de las actividades de siembra, se realizaron dos recorridos por los estuarios del rÁ¬o Muisne - CojÁ¬mies con la participación de representantes de las comunidades asentadas a lo largo del Sistema. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: El 15 de mayo, 2003, 900 semillas de Rhizophora mangle se sembraron sobre 0,56 ha en un área deforestada del sector Bilsa a lado de una piscina camaronera. Participaron 15 miembros de la Asociación ""Real Fortuna"" del poblado Bilsa y se logró una sobrevivencia del 90%. El crecimiento promedio por mes fue entre 3-7 cm.

El 26 de julio, 2003, 5.700 semillas de R. mangle se sembraron en una piscina camaronera abandonada en el sector Tortuga por la celebración del Día Nacional e Internacional del Ecosistema Manglar. Cuarenta usuarios ancestrales del manglar juntos con 15 estudiantes de un colegio de la localidad y 12 estudiantes de la Universidad ""Luis Vargas Torres"" de Esmeraldas ayudaron a los miembros de FUNDECOL con la siembra. Se plantaron 2,20 ha y se logró una sobrevivencia del 85% con un crecimiento por mes de entre 3-6 cm.

Luego en diciembre 2003 se volvió a sembrar 4.800 semillas de R. mangle en una piscina camaronera abandonada del mismo sector Tortuga. 18 miembros de la Asociación ""Bellavista"" participaron en la siembra de 3 ha y se vió una sobrevivencia del 95% con un crecimiento promedio por mes entre 1-2 cm.

Otra piscina camaronera abandonada y un área deforestada también se plantaron en diciembre 2003 en el sector Chontaduro. Con la ayuda de la misma Asociación ""Bellavista,"" 2.500 semillas de R. mangle se sembraron sobre 1,39 ha de la piscina abandonada y 500 se sembraron sobre 0,26 ha del área deforestada. Se logró una sobrevivencia del 85% en el primer sitio y del 95% en el segundo con un crecimiento por mes de entre 2-4 cm en ambos lugares.

En febrero 2004, 0,10 ha se sembraron con 500 semillas de R. mangle en un área en constante sedimentación y presión de las mareas en el sector Las Manchas de la Isla Congal. Se vió una sobrevivencia del 70% y un crecimiento por mes de entre 2-5 cm.

4.500 semillas de R. mangle se sembraron en el sector Daule en marzo 2004. Treinta miembros de la Asociación ""Defensa del Manglar"" de la cabecera parroquial Daule ayudaron a recuperar 2,77 ha en un área deforestada a lado de una piscina camaronera. La sobrevivencia fue del 90% y el crecimiento por mes entre 2-3 cm. 

Tres siembras se realizaron en mayo 2004 con la ayuda de 29 miembros de la Asociación ""Real Fortuna"" del poblado de Bilsa. 2.000 semillas de R. mangle se sembraron sobre 0,79 ha de una piscina camaronera abandonada en el sector El Cuerval; 1.500 semillas de Avicennia germinans sobre 0,56 ha en el sector Golfín; y 4.600 semillas de R. mangle sobre 1,65 ha en un área deforestada en el sector El Congal.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Un 30% de la población ubicada en el Cantón Muisne (cerca de 3.000 familias) depende de los recursos que ofrece el manglar. Las prácticas que desarrollan están relacionadas con la extracción de moluscos y crustáceos, la pesca, entre otros; por esto es primordial la protección de este ecosistema (Navarrete 2002a).
Se conformó un equipo de monitoreo, basados en el interés por parte de miembros de las asociaciones usuarias del ecosistema manglar, para que de esta manera conozcan sobre la dinámica de adaptación y crecimiento de las especies de mangle.
En respuesta a esto se llevo a cabo una charla in situ sobre lo que se realizaría para dicho fin.
Ya en lo específico se procedió a establecer el 20% del área, para luego demarcar está superficie en 5 cuadros iguales, en los cuales se procediera a tomar los datos de adaptación y crecimiento requeridos para esta ocasión.
FUNDECOL y las asociaciones comunitarias de la zona, presentaron al Ministerio del Ambiente – Regional Esmeraldas los requisitos para el aval y entrega de 31.62 hectáreas de piscinas camaroneras abandonadas para su recuperación y reincorporación al ecosistema manglar.
De la misma manera se ha solicitado la Inspección de áreas ya reforestadas para que se las incorpore al Patrimonio del Estado, mediante el Registro de Plantaciones que se creó para dicho fin.
Hasta la fecha cuando se entregó el informe final del proyecto, no se había obtenido respuesta alguna a las peticiones en referencia. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-alaska-the-role-of-thermal-regime-in-tundra-plant-community-restoration/	USA: Alaska: The Role of Thermal Regime in Tundra Plant Community Restoration	United States of America	1992-08-02	1996-08-02	"Mineral extraction activities in the Arctic regions of the world produce long-lasting ecological disturbances. Assisted recovery from such disturbances may require restoration of the tundra thermal regime. In this study, plugs of entire root zone and live tundra plants were transplanted to a disturbed site in Alaska oil fields. The dominant species were Carex aquatilis, Eriophorum angustifolium, Dupontia fisheri, Poa glauca, Festuca rubra, Salix ovalifolia, S. reticulata, and Sphagnum spp. The study focused on plant responses in the plugs to thermal regime manipulations by means of greenhouse and of single- or double-plug treatments. All plugs continued to produce new plants with time and expanded in area and canopy volume. Plants responded differently to treatments and generally reversed those responses when the greenhouse treatment was reversed the third year after transplant. This small-scale experiment showed that the native thermal regime of a plant community is vital in revegetating a disturbed tundra.Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The thermal regime of a permafrost system is defined by the rate of heat transfer between the atmosphere and the permafrost. The regime determines the thaw depth and the hydrology on the tundra. Gravel fills placed directly on the tundra for roads and structures associated with oil and gas operations alter this thermal regime. The fills may also directly block groundwater flow, thereby affecting the permafrost hydrology and thermal regime over extended areas. The physical effects of altered thermal regime, thaw depth, and permafrost hydrology are displayed on the tundra by surface subsidence. The biological effects are displayed in plant mortality, changing plant growth and reproduction, and shifting of the floristic composition of the tundra plant community (Lawson et al. 1978; Walker et al. 1987; Hinzman et al. 1996, 1997). The undisturbed tundra community used for donor transplant consisted of grasses, sedges, willows, and mosses. The dominant species in this community were Carex aquatilis (water sedge), Eriophorum angustifolium (tall cottongrass), Dupontia fisheri (Fisher’s tundragrass), Poa glauca (glaucus bluegrass), Festuca rubra (red fescue), Salix ovalifolia (oval-leaf willow), S. reticulata (netleaf willow), and Sphagnum spp. (Kidd et al. 1996). This project tested whether a live tundra plug, taken intact from a donor plant community with an attached root zone that had been cut to the depth of the thawed ground, could retain its own unique thermal regime on a small scale and, when transplanted in a disturbed environment with similar thaw and groundwater depths, if this living plug, with associated bacteria and mycorrhizae, would continue to grow and reproduce in that environment. The objective was to test this assumption with treatments that simulated varying rates of heat transfer to the transplants.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: On 23 August 1992, two experimental plots were established, one on the gravel pad (henceforth the gravel plot) and a second on the native tundra (henceforth the donor plot) located approximately 220 m south of the gravel plot. Each measured 18.9 x 9.8 m. The donor plot was subdivided into 50 subplots 0.61 x 0.61 m in dimension arranged on a spacing pattern 1.83 x 1.83 m (center to center) comprised of five transects of 10 subplots each.

On the donor plot, plugs 13.3 cm in diameter were cut to the depth of the active layer (15 - 30 cm) with a core-cutting tool of our own design. When the cutting edge of the tool reached the bottom of the active layer, the plug sheared at the frozen boundary and was easily lifted, intact, with the cutting tool. A total of 60 intact plugs were extracted from the donor plot and the holes filled with substrates from the gravel plot to test the effect of changing substrate thermal conductivity in the donor plot.

The experimental gravel plot at NPBS2 measured 22.6 x 9.7 m and was part of a larger area that was fertilized in 1992 with 20-20-10 NPK mixture, 450 kg/ha, and left for ""natural"" recovery (Kidd et al. 1996).  The gravel plot was subdivided into 60 experimental subplots of 1.8 x 1.8 m spacing (center to center) arranged in five transects of 12 subplots each. Four treatments were applied to subplots on the gravel plot: ambient or exposed single plug transplant, exposed double-plug transplant, a single plug covered with a greenhouse, and double plugs covered with a greenhouse. Treatments were randomly assigned to each subplot, and 10 replicates of each plug treatment were installed. Tundra plugs were transplanted in the gravel plot by excavating a small hole equal in depth to the length of the plug to be planted. Double plugs and single plugs were used to vary the belowground tundra sod volume and heat transfer rates. Double plugs were transplanted adjacent to one another, touching on a side with no space between them.

Ten single plugs and 10 double plugs were covered on 10 June 1993 with commercial polyethylene storage totes (greenhouses), slightly tapered toward the base and measuring 54 x 39 cm at the open end. When inverted, the tapered top of these ""greenhouses"" was 31 cm above ground. Other planted plugs were left exposed. Air and soil temperatures from one ambient reference station without a greenhouse and two treatment stations with greenhouses were collected from 10 June through 30 August 1993. The thermal regime of covered plugs was subjected to a yearly cycle as a result of applying the greenhouse year-round.

Both study sites were visited on 14 - 17 July 1993, 29 August - 3 September 1993; 10 - 15 August 1994, 17 - 22 July 1995, and 11 - 13 August 1996. Plant responses in the gravel plot and donor plot were monitored during each visit by counting the live shoots of sedge, grass, and willow, and by measuring plug area, moss cover, and willow cover. The canopy volume over each plug was measured by multiplying the mean height and plug area. The canopy volume for the donor plot was the initial plug area multiplied by the mean canopy height in the donor plot.

During the July 1995 visit, many greenhouses were found filled to near capacity with new growth. All greenhouses were removed from treated plugs and placed on the exposed plugs to initiate a new phase of thermal-regime manipulation. During the August 1996 visit, however, only 3 out of 20 boxes were found in place; the remaining boxes were broken or removed from the plugs by unknown agents, apparently during the early spring of that year. Plant responses for that year were collected, and the results reflected mixed or ""reversed"" treatments.

The responses of several plant species were grouped together rather than studied intensively. For example, the responses of Carex aquatilis, Eriophorum angustifolium, E. Russeolum (red cottongrass), and other sedges were reported under sedges; Dupontia fisheri, Poa glauca, Festuca rubra, and other grasses were reported under grasses; and Salix ovalifolia, S. Reticulata, and Salix spp. were reported under willows. The plant responses from the gravel plot and the donor plot were used in analyses of variance. Comparisons of mean plant responses from the gravel plot with those from the donor plot were conducted by Dunnett's mean separation test to estimate the joint confidence factors (Dunnett 1955; Becket et al. 1988). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: --Air and Soil Temperatures--
During the first growing season, the cumulative greenhouse air and soil temperatures were 749Âº and 628ÂºC thawing degree-days. The ambient air and soil temperatures during the same period were, respectively, 444Âº and 566ÂºC thawing degree-days. The mean greenhouse air and soil temperatures were 9.3Âº and 7.8ÂºC, while the mean ambient air and soil temperatures were 5.5Âº and 7.0ÂºC, respectively.

--Plug Holes in the Donor Plot--
The surfaces of the filled holes in the donor plot remained bare and sank below the tundra grade at a rate of 1 - 2 cm/yr.

--Sedge--
Mean sedge densities increased with time. Mean densities for the donor, July 1995, and August 1996 treatments were, 882, 1186, and 1329 treatments/m2. The sedge density continued to increase after greenhouse reversal. The mean sedge densities for single exposed, double exposed, single covered, and double covered plugs for July 1995 were 1460.0, 1483.0, 720.7, and 1080.0 treatments/m2 and for August 1996 were 1520.0, 1362.0, 1137.0, and 1297.0 treatments/m2, respectively. The sedge density was higher for exposed plugs than covered plugs; reversing the greenhouse treatment accordingly reversed the response. Covering the double plugs reduced sedge density more than covering the single plugs.

--Grass--
Mean grass densities generally increased with time. Mean densities for the donor, July 1995, and August 1996 treatments were, respectively, 33.7, 304.2, and 353.0 treatments/m2. The grass density continued to increase after greenhouse reversal. Mean grass densities for single exposed, double exposed, single covered, and double covered plugs for July 1995 were 338.3, 319.2, 254.6, and 304.5 treatments/m2 and for August 1996 were 469.9, 387.6, 216.0, and 342.1 treatments/m2, respectively. Grass density was higher for exposed plugs than covered plugs; reversing the greenhouse treatment did not reverse the response except for single covered plugs. Other treatments were dominated by continued increasing grass densities.

--Willow--
Mean willow densities generally decreased with time. Mean densities for the donor, July 1995, and August 1996 treatments were, respectively, 235.3, 105.1, and 89.4 treatments/m2. Willow density continued to decrease after greenhouse reversal. Mean willow densities for single exposed, double exposed, single covered, and double covered plugs for July 1995 were 80.4, 109.5, 80.8, and 149.8 treatments/m2 and for August 1996 were 53.5, 86.7, 83.0, and 134.4 treatments/m2, respectively. Willow density was higher for covered plugs than exposed plugs; the effect of reversing the greenhouse treatment was dominated by the continued decline in willow densities in all but the single covered plugs.

--Willow Cover--
Mean willow cover decreased in the second year but continued to increase thereafter. Mean willow cover for the donor, July 1995, and August 1996 treatments was, respectively, 17.7, 12.2, and 14.0%. Mean willow covers for single exposed, double exposed, single covered, and double covered plugs for July 1995 were 4.36, 3.73, 11.40, and 29.4% and for August 1996 were 10.9, 7.73, 16.1, and 21.2%. Therefore, greenhouse treatments before and after reversal increased willow cover in single and double plugs even while their willow density decreased relative to that of the donor plugs.

--Moss--
Mean moss cover decreased the second year but increased thereafter. Mean moss cover for the donor, July 1995, and August 1996 treatments was, respectively, 53.3, 35.0, and 28.1% Mean moss cover for single exposed, double exposed, single covered, and double covered plugs for July 1995 was 14.6, 26.82, 60.0, and 38.6% and for August 1996 was 46.8, 28.9, 26.0, and 10.6%, respectively. This shows that exposed plugs produced greater moss cover than covered plugs and that reversal of the greenhouse treatment accordingly reversed moss cover.

--Plug Area--
The plug area that was initially 140 cm2 was also assumed as a reference plant area for the donor plot. The plug area in 1993 was assessed by visual inspection to be unchanged. Mean plug area increased with time. Mean plug areas for July 1995 and August 1996 treatments were, respectively, 373 and 4528 cm2. Plug area continued to increase after greenhouse reversal. Mean plug area for single exposed, double exposed, single covered, and double covered plugs for July 1995 was 285, 243, 571 and 395 cm2 and for August 1996 was 407, 311, 565, and 428 cm2. This shows that plug area increased with greenhouse treatment and that the reversal did not reduce the areas previously gained by the covered plugs.

--Canopy Volume--
Mean canopy volume for the donor, July 1995, and August 1996 treatments was 1.15, 8.02 and 7.36, respectively. Mean canopy volume for single exposed, double exposed, single covered, and double covered plugs for July 1995 was 2.88, 2.52, 15.4, and 11.3 and for August 1996 was 5.69, 4.47, 10.9, and 8.39. Canopy volume increased with greenhouse treatment; reversal reduced the mean canopy height previously gained by the covered plugs.

--Summary of Results--
Grass density and canopy volume were consistently highly significant responses to thermal manipulation in July 1993 and August 1994. Plug area in 1994 was highly significant. Sedge density in 1993 and sedge density and willow densities in 1994 were not significant. Plant responses to greenhouse and plug number treatments for 1995 and 1996 were highly significant in all but willow density in 1995, willow cover in 1996, and moss cover in 1995 and 1996. Plants displayed complex response patterns to treatments.
This study did not verify reestablishment of the native thermal regime by direct heat balance measurements from the permafrost through the plant canopies in the donor and gravel plots. Conducting such measurements is extremely difficult. The gravel plot and the native tundra plots have vastly different thermal properties that contribute to different modes of heat transfer and seasonal and annual thermal regimes. For example, the mean thermal conductivity of the top 20-cm layer of the gravel is seven times greater than the top 50 cm of the tundra; the rates of heat transfer by convection, evapotranspiration, and conduction in undisturbed tussock tundra during early June are 8%, 58%, and 33%, respectively, and during early July are 47%, 32%, and 21%, respectively (Hinzman et al. 1996, 1997).
Having no direct measurements, it was not possible determine the degree to which a native thermal regime might have been established in the transplanted plugs. Instead, statistical inference based on the analysis of plant response to experimental manipulation of the thermal regime was used to determine whether some degree of native thermal regime was attained and plants survived or whether no degree of native thermal regime was attained and plants did not survive as a consequence of these manipulations.
The outcome of these manipulations was integrated in the measured plant responses. Analysis of variance tests was used to confirm that thermal-regime manipulations had highly significant effects on these observed plant responses. Sedges, grasses, willows, and mosses in the plugs generally responded differently to greenhouse and plug number treatments, and they generally produced reversed responses upon the reversal of greenhouse treatment. Whereas plants responded in a complex and diverse way to these manipulations, plug area and canopy volume continued to increase with time. Hence, the range of thermal-regime manipulation experienced by plugs in the gravel environment more or less corresponded to the native thermal regime.
The primary concern with respect to establishing a near-native thermal regime of transplanted plugs was the influence of the gravel environment on the small volume of the plug. But the plug hole experiment in the donor plot demonstrated that the thermal regime operated on a very small scale””that is, on the scale of the transplanted plug volume. The sinking of the gravel in the hole was the direct consequence of the difference between the thermal regime of the filled hole and that of live tundra plants surrounding the hole. This experiment explained how transplanted plugs may partially retain their native thermal regimes on the scale of single or double plug volumes, particularly that evapo-transpiration in summer (Hinzman et al. 1996, 1997) was an important component of this regime and that the hydrology of the gravel environment was similar to the native hydrology. The moisture regime of the plug was simulated to near donor plant conditions by cutting the plugs deep enough to reach the groundwater during June and August throughout the gravel plot and during July in the western section of the gravel plot when the groundwater level dropped to its lowest level. These levels were monitored by Kidd et al. (1996) at two stations across the northern section of the gravel plot.
In the gravel plot, plants in the plugs grew new green tissues, shoots, roots, tillers, seedheads, and litters. That all the 60 transplanted plugs in the gravel plot survived and produced new plants, and that the reversal of greenhouse treatment generally reversed the plant response, demonstrate that the manipulations were not so extreme as to cause irreversible plant response but were within the tolerance of plants in the plugs.
Irreversible effects of thermal regime have also been reported in plug transplants. For example, Jorgenson and Cater (1991) and Kidd et al. (1996) used tundra plug transplants with a primary focus on revegetation. Plugs were cut by spade and post-hole diggers, which produced shallower plugs and smaller mat volume than the ones used in this study. Jorgenson and Cater (1991) transplanted tundra plugs on a 1.5-m-deep gravel pad, and Kidd et al. (1996) transplanted more than 2000 plugs into 0-30 cm deep water in a NPBS2 gravel pad outside the gravel plot described in this study. The plugs were taken from undisturbed donor sites similar to those of this study.
The plugs in the deep gravel plot produced 11% total cover in one growing season (Jorgenson & Cater, 1991), compared with 95% total cover in the exposed plugs after one growing season in this study. The plugs in water experienced 58% mortality and produced 3% cover after three growing seasons (Kidd et al. 1996), compared with 235% and 189% increases, respectively, in canopy volume and plug area in the exposed plugs after three growing seasons in this study. These two studies provide useful contrasting examples of hydrologic host environments of transplants, one because of inadequate moisture in the deep gravel and the second because of excess moisture. The examples confirm the need for matching the thermal regimes of transplants and the host environment. Restoration of wetlands is a requirement under Section 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act for issuing a permit in Alaskan oil fields. The current restoration approach has a strong focus on revegetation to produce plant cover by methods that include direct seeding, fertilizing, sludge amendment, mulching, grass transplants, plug transplants, moisture enhancement with berms, and long-term studies of plant succession. Unfortunately, in these efforts, the components of heat transfer rates that determine a stable thermal regime of the restored tundra community have not been taken into account (Jorgenson & Cater 1993; Herlugson et al. 1996; McKendrick 1991, 1997). This study, therefore, has important implications for the restoration of disturbed tundra sites because it stresses the importance of a previously overlooked facet of restoration and will potentially influence practice going forward.
Indeed, the results of this study suggest that revegetation techniques that promote stabilization of the thermal regime may accelerate recovery. In 1988 the Kuparuck Oil Fields contained 472 ha of fill for roads and pads. Mining for gravel produced 239 ha of mine sites and an equal area for stockpiling mine refuse (Jacobs et al. 1993). Therefore, for every hectare of gravel fill, 2 ha of tundra mat are available at the design stage; but advance planning and engineering must be in place for its use in restoration. Knowledge of the permafrost thermal regime is a necessary requirement not only for oil exploration and production, for building stable and safe roads, and for establishing sound supporting structures for equipment and pipelines; but it is also needed for the restoration of tundra communities. The two objectives can be integrated so that adequate planning is in place for maintaining and using live tundra mats that at present are inevitably destroyed under gravel fills and mine-site stockpiles.

By assuming that these spatially separated stands develop along a similar pathway over time, instantaneous sampling should reveal successional changes usually associated with aging and should provide an opportunity to evaluate the success of the rehabilitation. A study conducted between 1992 and 1994 compared relative densities of pioneer and secondary species, species richness, and a similarity index of the herbaceous layer, tree, beetle, millipede, bird, and small-mammal communities of rehabilitating areas of known age with those of 30-year-old unmined forests and unmined forests of unknown age adjacent to the rehabilitating area. Similarly, a study conducted in 1995 examined soils from rehabilitating stands of varying ages and compared them to soils from two disturbed, unmined stands 30 and 58 years of age, and from a mature unmined stand to assess age-related trends in select soil properties. Both studies found that the degree of similarity between unmined stands and rehabilitating stands of different ages increased with increasing regeneration age of rehabilitating stands, suggesting that rehabilitating communities are developing towards the status of unmined communities. It is therefore concluded that RBM’s rehabilitation program is gradually resulting in the reestablishment of a coastal dune forest ecosystem.Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The coastal dune forests north of Richards Bay have a long history of human presence. Iron-age man has been present since at least 270 AD (Maggs 1976), and Bantu people practicing a slash-and-burn agriculture since the fifteenth century (Bruton et al. 1980). During the nineteenth century, the area was inhabited by the Mbonambi tribe of blacksmiths who made the stabbing spears used by the Zulu king Shaka. Aerial photographs taken during 1937 show highly degraded vegetation owing to the activities of local inhabitants. However, depopulation resulted in the recovery of much of the area through natural succession by 1974 (Weisser & Marques 1982).
In July 1977, Richards Bay Minerals began extracting heavy metals (e.g. zircon, rutile, and ilmenite) from the dunes northeast of Richards Bay via opencast mining. This venture brought renewed degradation to the dune forests, and the mining activities in the area continue at the present time. Stands of unmined coastal dunes to the north of the present mining operation comprise patches of forest which, based on the inspection of aerial photographs, had been cleared of all vegetation some 30 – 35 years prior to the present study. Some of these patches have been afforested with Pinus elliottii (flash pine) and Eucalyptus grandis (eucalyptus), while others, for unknown reasons, were recolonized by indigenous vegetation, mainly broad-leaved trees such as Canthium inerme (common turkey-berry), Celtis Africana (white stinkwood), Draceana aletriformis (large-leaved dragon tree, dominant in the shrub layer), Clausena anisata (horsewood), Peddiea Africana (poison olive), Deinbollia oblongifolia (dune soap berry), Scutia myrtina (cat-thorn), and Teclea gerrardii (Zulu cherry-orange).
In the rehabilitating areas, early stages of regeneration are dominated by low-growing Acacia karroo shrubs, which develop into woodlands with broad-leaved tree species characteristic of the surrounding indigenous forests establishing themselves after 12 years. In such areas, A. karroo is starting to senesce, and species typical of surrounding unmined areas, such as Sideroxylon inerme (white milkwood), Celtis africana (white stinkwood), Mimusops caffra (coastal red milkwood), Vepris lanceolata (white ironwood), and Trichilia emetica (Natal mahogany) are beginning to occupy the canopy gaps and are common in the undergrowth. On these older stands, the groundcover is dominated by the herb Asystasia gangetica, with the grass Brachiaria chusqueoides also well established (Camp 1990). In accordance with the policy of landowners interacting with the mining company, the rehabilitation program at Richards Bay is directed at establishing an indigenous coastal dune forest on one-third of the area exposed to mining.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Richards Bay Minerals has been extracting heavy metals (zircon, rutile, and ilmenite) from some of the dunes northeast of Richards Bay since July 1977. Here, dune mining is preceded by removal of all surface vegetation, and topsoil is collected for later use in rehabilitation. A dredger, floating on a pond maintained within the dune, sucks up the sand and separates the heavy minerals before they are pumped to a stockpile on land. The remaining sand (> 94% of the original volume) is pumped to the area behind the pond where, after ""dewatering,"" a new dune is formed and subsequently reshaped to resemble the topography of dunes prior to mining (Camp 1990). In accordance with the policy of the landowners, the rehabilitation program at Richards Bay is directed at establishing an indigenous coastal dune forest on one-third of the area exposed to mining. 

After stabilization of the dune (6-12 months after the removal of vegetation), topsoil collected prior to mining is spread in a 10-15-cm layer over the reshaped dune. A seed mixture comprising Pennisetum americanum (babala grass), Sorghum sp. (sorghum), and Crotalaria juncea (sun hemp), as well as seed from several indigenous species collected prior to mining, is sown on the dune (Camp 1990). Windbreaks (1.5 m high) are erected across the dune, facing the prevailing winds. These structures reduce erosion, wind-induced surface evaporation, and conceivably transpiration from newly germinated seeds. The windbreaks are usually removed after about 3 months. These actions result in the development of a dense cover crop within a month, which may ameliorate the surface microclimate for the germination and subsequent establishment of indigenous species (Lubke et al. 1992). After 6-8 months the cover crop dies off, leaving the dunes covered by dense stands of the indigenous grass Eragrostis curvula (weeping love grass). All vegetation establishment after the initial seeding described above is from the seedbank in the topsoil and from dispersal from surrounding rehabilitating and unmined areas. A management policy of minimum interference is adhered to once the rehabilitation process has been initiated and involves the mechanical control of alien invasive plants (van Aarde et al. 1996a).

At the time of the first study, conducted from 1992-1994 to assess the species composition of the rehabilitating stands, the landscape where dune mining took place included a series of regenerating areas varying in age from a few months to 16 years, a belt 100-250 m wide of unmined coastal dune forests fragmented by plantation patches, mainly Eucalyptus saligna (blue gum) and Casuarina equisetifolia (beefwood), along the coast, and a belt forested with Casuarina equisetifolia, which do not invade the rehabilitating areas, on the inland side of regenerating areas. These Casuarina belts range in age from a few months to more than 8 years. The areas inland of the mining operation are relatively densely populated and are characterized by patches of exotic and indigenous vegetation, in most cases continuously disturbed by grazing. The landscape also includes patches of sand dunes stripped of vegetation in preparation for mining, and dunes being reshaped and prepared for rehabilitation. 

The study was conducted on known-aged stands of rehabilitating areas ranging from one week to 16 years in age, as well as on surrounding unmined forests. Surveys were also conducted on unmined stands 30-35 years old and in a mature forest of unknown age. The analyses presented herein were restricted to data collected during the austral summers from 1992 to 1994.

Species richness for various groups of plants and animals was taken as the total number of species recorded during the summer(s) when the surveys were conducted. For the purpose of this study, pioneer species were defined as those having their highest relative density in stands less than 5 years old, except for the herb layer, where stands less than 8 years were included in this category. All other species (excluding the pioneer species) recorded on the unmined stands were designated as secondary species. Relative densities for various groups of plants and animals for each of these two categories were calculated as the sum of the relative densities of all species within the group. Estimation of species-specific relative densities differed between taxa and is described below. 

--Herbaceous Communities--
The herbaceous layer was defined as all nonwoody vegetation less than 1 m in height. Thirty plots (1,250 m2) were located randomly in each of three different-aged stands within the rehabilitating area. Five to six 1-m2 quadrats were located at each plot and the cover frequency--the percentage of quadrats per plot in which a given species contributed to the cover (Barbour et al. 1987)--was recorded. Relative density for each species was calculated as the fraction of total frequencies for all species within a stand.

--Tree Communities--
Tree community surveys were based on point-centered quarter transects (Cottam & Curtis 1956). Four to six transects were located on each of the stands and marked at 10-m intervals. The number of intervals varied according to the length of the transect and ranged between 8 and 14 intervals. Two-thirds of the marks on the transect were randomly selected to be sampled, which ensured that the same individuals were seldom represented in more than one sample. At each mark the nearest distance to a woody canopy species (trees > 2 m), and a woody undercover species (shrubs > 1 > 2 m) was recorded and the species identified. Density was calculated for each canopy and each undercover species by the method of Cottam & Curtis (1956). Total stand density was calculated by summing all species-specific densities. Species-specific relative density is species-specific density presented as a fraction of total density within a stand. 

--Millipede Communities--
Information required to estimate stand- and species-specific relative densities was collected on fixed-width transects (35 x 6 m) randomly located in each of six different stands as unique sampling areas. To account for potential diurnal changes in activity, only data collected between 06:00 and 11:59 were included in our analysis. During the study period of three weeks in December 1992, approx 3,200 millipedes were collected and classified into morphospecies. Specimens of each morphospecies were identified form reference material kept at the Natural Science Museum in Durban, South Africa. Stand-specific relative densities were calculated as the percentage contribution of each species to the total number of millipedes recorded on a given stand.

--Beetle Communities--
Beetles (Order Coleoptera) were collected by means of pitfall, flight-intercept, and sweeping methods in stands of known age, sorted to morphospecies, and counted. Relative densities and species richness of all beetles were determined separately for each of the sampling methods because these methods could sample beetle communities differentially. Stand-specific relative densities were calculated as the percentage contribution of each species to the total number of beetles recorded on a given stand for each sampling technique. 

--Bird Communities--
The information required to estimate stand- and species-specific relative densities, community composition, and species richness was collected along three 425-500-m fixed-line transects placed on each of the stands included in the study, except the stand 1-< 2 years old, where one transect was used. The distance between all transects was at least 200 m, ensuring independence of data collected along each transect. 

Each transect was surveyed seven times per day. On days when weather conditions did not enable seven surveys, the surveys were completed on the next day. The data for each day were treated as a single replicate for that transect and were collected as described by Burnham et al. (1980). The information included species identity, group size, and perpendicular distance from the line. Stand-specific relative densities (rD) were estimated with the formula rD = rN/rV, where rN = relative number seen and rV = estimated relative visibility of the species. rV was estimated by using mean sighting distance, through a regression formula obtained from 68 species-stand combinations for which enough data were available to estimate density with the computer software DISTANCE (Laake et al. 1993). 

--Small-mammal Communities--
Small mammals (rodents and shrews) were captured with Sherman livetraps set on permanent trapping grids for five consecutive days and nights (a trapping session) per stand. The traps were checked at dawn, and all individuals captured were marked by toe clipping before release. 

Population estimates for each trapping session were obtained by the mark-recapture models of Otis et al. (1978) and converted to density by means of the area covered by the trapping grid. The species-specific estimated densities for each stand were used to calculate total stand-specific density by summing all the species-specific densities within a stand. Stand-specific relative densities for each species were then calculated as species-specific densities within a stand expressed as a fraction of stand-specific total density.

--Soil Structure--
The second study, conducted between February and October 1995, was aimed at examining the soil properties of four coastal dunes undergoing between 3 and 18 years of rehabilitation following mining and at comparing these with soil properties of two adjacent unmined but disturbed forests of 30 and 58 years old, respectively, as well as with a mature forest of unknown age but at least 100 years old. Because humus, the main constituent of soil organic material (Williams 1987), consists primarily of decomposing plant material that continuously accumulates on the soil surface from which it is broken down and recycled into the top layer of soil, any changes in soil attributes taking place during succession should first be evident in the upper 10 cm. Thus, the upper 10 cm of the soil were sampled in four rehabilitating areas, two unmined but disturbed forests, and a mature forest at Richards Bay, and their soil properties compared.

Soil samples (2500 - 3000 g per sampling point) were collected on three sampling occasions. Soils collected on the first two sampling occasions in February and May 1995 were used to determine soil macro characteristics (soil humus or soil organic material), whereas soils collected on the third sampling occasion in October 1995 were used to assess soil chemical characteristics (organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium). All sampling was conducted on the sea-facing slopes of the second dune from the coastline. Samples were collected on five randomly selected fixed-width transects (6 x 35 m) located during each of the sampling occasions on each of the stands. Each sample comprised six sub-samples taken at different localities on each of the transects by means of a square corer (10 x 10 x 10 cm).

Percentage total organic content (%TotOrg) representing the decomposing plant material for each of the samples is expected as a percentage of the difference in a soil aliquot's weight prior to and after the burning thereof in a crucible over a bunsen burner for 30 minutes (Williams 1987). Percentage organic content representing the decomposing plant material less than 2 mm in particle size (%Org, 2 mm) and greater than 2 mm in particle size (%Org. 2 mm) was determined similarly after aliquots were passed through a 2-mm sieve. To determine pH of the soil, a 10-g sample was mixed with distilled water in a 1:2 ratio of soil (dry weight) to water and the pH of the water recorded with a pH metre.

The determination of carbon (C), calcium (Ca), organic nitrogen (N), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), and phosphorus (P) concentrations in each of the samples followed the procedures suggested by Moore and Chapman (1986) and The Non-affiliated Soil Analysis Working Committee (1990). Calcium and Mg content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy, whereas K and Na were determined by flame emission spectroscopy. Organic carbon was determined by the Walkley-Black method. Nitrogen was determined by the Kjeldahl method of digestion by sulphuric acid. Nitrite is seldom present in detectable amounts (The Non-Affiliated Soil Analysis Working Committee 1990) and therefore was not included in the analysis.

Soil fertility was assessed by determining the growth response of Raphanus sativus (radish) seeds planted in aliquots of soil from each sample taken from the upper 10 cm in the four rehabilitating stands, the 30-year disturbed stand, and the mature forest (100 years) and grown in an outdoor planthouse. One hundred aliquots of 300 g each of soil from each stand were placed in 250-ml styrofoam cups, and a randomly selected seed was planted in each of these at 1-cm soil depth, resulting in 100 replicates per stand. Each pot received the same amount of distilled water daily (80 - 100 ml) as needed to prevent drying and was exposed to the same temperature (28ÂºC) and sunlight. Radishes were allowed to grow for 27 days, after which they were harvested, cleaned by washing, oven-dried at 60ÂºC for two days, and weighed. Total plant weight, tuber weight (part of plant between first root hair and base of stem), and leaf weight (part of plant above base of stem) were recorded separately. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The rehabilitating and unmined stands are characterized by a progressive age-related increase in heterogeneity, with the earliest stages of recovery appearing as grasslands, which are soon transformed into an almost impenetrable shrub layer dominated by Acacia karroo. Stands 5-8 years old were still dominated by A. karroo, which had attained a height of 1.5-3 meters. Older stands (8-11 years) were still dominated by A. karroo up to 8 m high and exhibited a ground cover dominated by the indigenous grass Digitaria diversinervis (finger grass). The 11-16-year-old stands comprise a well-developed woodland canopy, and, although dominated by A. karroo, patches of treefalls resulting from senescence were dominated by a variety of secondary dune-forest tree species at heights up to 5 m. The 35-year-old stands appeared as stands with a relatively greater diversity than the oldest rehabilitating stands, with A. karroo less dominant in the canopy layer. The unmined forest of unknown age included in the present study was characterized by a canopy 12-15 m high comprising a variety of tree species. The canopy had several gaps resulting from tree falls.

--Species Richness--
In general, for all but the mammals, the number of species increased with increasing age of rehabilitating stands. Furthermore, with the exception of the mammals and herbaceous layer, the unmined stands harbored more species per group than the mined rehabilitating stands. In the case of the trees and millipedes, increased species richness with stand age was characterized by the addition of species. In the case of the beetles and birds, however, the increase in species richness was characterized by both species addition and replacement.

--Relative Densities--
For all the groups the general trend was a decrease in the relative densities of pioneer species as stand age increased. Relative densities for pioneer species for all the groups were also considerably lower on unmined stands than on the mined rehabilitating stands. This suggests that, although increasing age of stands is not always associated with species replacement, it is associated with a decrease in the relative densities of those species first to colonize areas disturbed by mining.

--Similarity Indices--
Similarity between unmined stands and rehabilitating stands of different ages increased with increasing age of rehabilitating stands. This suggests that all these rehabilitating communities, in terms of species composition and relative densities, are developing towards the unmined communities. 

--Soil Composition--
Soil organic material, percentage organic carbon and concentrations of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and nitrogen all increased with an increase in habitat regeneration age. Concentrations of most of these elements were lower than those recorded on the 58-year-old unmined and mature unmined stands; however, multivariate analyses suggest that the similarity of these values for rehabilitating stands and unmined stands is increasing in direct proportion with regeneration age. This suggested age-related increase in soil fertility is supported by the radish growth trial, which showed an increase in plant biomass with soil age. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Based on the analysis of data gathered during these studies, it follows that rehabilitation is occurring and that this may result in the reestablishment of a coastal dune forest ecosystem. However, rehabilitation affected by succession depends on the availability of species sources from which colonization can take place. In the case of the Richards Bay mining operation, the layout of the mining path results in such refuges being present in the form of a relatively narrow unmined seaward strip along the mining path, as well as fragments of relatively undisturbed forests ahead of and behind the mining path. On the landward side, rehabilitating areas are bordered by intensely disturbed areas of plantations and densely inhabited areas. Due to these contextual factors, the rate at which natural succession can proceed is somewhat limited. 

Nitrogen levels in the soil at rehabilitating sites represent another factor influencing the rate of recovery. Despite the age-related increase in nitrogen concentrations, absolute values on mined stands were much lower than those on unmined stands and those recorded in other biomes (Tilman 1987; Stock et al. 1995). Even though the unmined stands had much higher levels of nitrogen than the rehabilitating stands, the levels of nitrogen in the unmined stands are not considered high. Low levels of nitrogen in these stands are therefore not surprising, particularly when considering that dynamic models predict that it can take 100 years for nitrogen concentrations to change from low to high on nutrient-poor soil (Tilman 1985).

The relatively high growth rate of Acacia karroo, which dominates all the mined rehabilitating stands, could conceivably affect nutrient turnover (Vitousek & Walker 1989; Stock & Allsopp 1992). Like other Acacia species, A. karroo has the ability to fix nitrogen (Barnes & Fagg 1995), and thus to help enrich surface soils. Therefore, with its ability to grow at low nitrogen levels, A. karroo may be an important component driving the vegetation development in the rehabilitating stands at Richards Bay, influencing changes in soil characteristics in tandem with those tree species that are becoming established in openings within 18-year-old A. karroo woodland (van Dyk 1997).
The success of this rehabilitation program may be assessed in terms of structural (e.g., species richness and species diversity) and functional (e.g., cycling and fixation of energy and minerals) similarities of rehabilitating areas with those of unmined areas. Because the rehabilitation program was initiated relatively recently, differences are likely to exist between the oldest rehabilitating stand and unmined areas. The evaluation of the rehabilitation program thus has to rely on: (1) the trends of community development there being similar to those recorded on disturbed but unmined areas; or (2) the temporal trends of community variables on rehabilitating stands either forming or having a high likelihood of forming a continuum with values recorded on unmined areas–increasing similarity with unmined areas.
It is important to note that the stands sampled during these studies do not represent a complete successional sere, but that the rehabilitating stands are representative of relatively early stages (0-18 years) of community development. The unmined areas 30-35 years old and 58 years old have been selected to represent a later seral stage, and the other unmined area (Zulti North), a relatively older coastal dune forest, to represent a mature coastal dune forest (Weisser 1987). The analyses presented here show definite increasing trends in species richness for the trees, beetles, millipedes, and birds. The lack of a similar trend for rodents and shrews may be ascribed to the low species richness of these communities, and a low sampling effort of unmined areas may account for the relatively few herbaceous species found here. Other studies, using different indices of diversity and species richness, on woody plants (Lubke et al. 1992; Mentis & Ellery 1994), millipedes (van Aarde et al. 1996), bettles (Vogt 1993), ants (Majer & de Kock 1992), birds (Kritzinger 1996), and rodents (Ferreira 1993; Ferreira & van Aarde 1996) of the area showed increasing species diversity.
The definitions of pioneer and secondary species used in this study make it inevitable that a decrease in pioneers and an increase in secondary species will be observed with an increase in habitat regeneration age. These trends, however, serve as an illustration of unidirectional changes in species composition, as can occur during ecological succession. Species composition for the different stands differed considerably and resulted from the addition and/or replacement of species. It, thus, seems that ecological succession is driving the development of the communities from relatively simple (e.g., communities dominated by relatively few pioneer species) to relatively complex (e.g., communities dominated by several secondary species).
As already mentioned, the unmined forest 30-35 years old represents a later seral stage of coastal dune forest succession, while the unmined area at Zulti North depicts a “mature” coastal dune forest of unknown age (Weisser 1987). In terms of the present investigation, these two areas may be considered as controls to which the rehabilitating stands have been compared. The analyses of patterns of similarity for all the studied taxa indicate that an increase in rehabilitating stand age is associated with an increase in the similarity of that stand with the unmined stand. Thus, although the characteristics of the rehabilitating communities differ from those of the unmined stands, it appears that all the communities in rehabilitating stands are in the process of developing characteristics increasingly similar to those of communities in unmined stands.
The difference in species richness between the rehabilitating stands and the unmined stands most likely results from the absence and/or rarity of some forest specialists in rehabilitating stands. With many species typical of unmined areas already present in the oldest rehabilitating stands, however, it seems as if conditions within these areas are changing to facilitate the establishment of communities with characteristics similar to those of unmined areas, with a possible subsequent colonization by forest specialists. In the case of the vegetation, this probably results from changes in light intensity and soil characteristics. Colonization of older rehabilitating areas by plant species typical of adjacent unmined areas is facilitated by fruit-eating birds and vervet monkeys foraging in unmined as well as rehabilitating areas (Foord et al. 1994). Colonization of rehabilitating stands by animal taxa through species addition and replacement probably results from habitat requirements being fulfilled through structural development of the vegetation.
The results of the soil study indicate that nitrogen, carbon, calcium, magnesium, and potassium concentrations are all changing directionally with regeneration age, suggesting that the availability of these elements in rehabilitating stands is increasing with time. This unidirectional quantitative change in soil characteristics supports the notion that soil properties are developing on this sere of coastal dune forest and that soil fertility is increasing with age. Thus, with time following disturbance, and without further disturbance, soil properties of rehabilitating areas may approach those of surrounding unmined forests in the Richards Bay area. Indeed, the concentrations of elements other than potassium on the 58-year-old stand were very similar to those recorded on the mature stand, suggesting that full recovery of these elements may occur within a relatively short time.
In conclusion, the results obtained in these studies show that there are still differences between the oldest rehabilitating stand and the unmined coastal forest, but that the similarity between rehabilitating stands and the unmined forest is increasing with the regeneration age of the unmined stand. The criteria employed herein therefore lead to the conclusion that rehabilitation of community structure has initially been successful but is not yet complete. "

A 5-year experiment conducted at two barren sites near the Severonikel nickel-copper smelter at Monchegorsk, northwestern Russia tested whether the survival and performace of seedlings of Mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) can be enhanced by physical sheltering and how large the supposed benefits to survival and performance are in relation to liming. Seedling performance was assessed by measuring growth parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence. Physical sheltering was found to be beneficial in some conditions: when soil characteristics were not so harsh as to cause 100% mortality, sheltering increased both survival and performance of birch seedlings. Although the benefits of liming on seedling performance and survival were stronger than the benefits of sheltering, sheltering may still have its uses in restoration when large-scale liming is not applicable, for example, when the ecological side effects of liming are to be avoided.Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The Severonikel smelter is one of the top polluters in Europe, predominantly in sulfur dioxide (SO2) and heavy metals (Pearce 1994). In the early 1990s, it emitted annually 200 kt of SO2 and 2.7 and 3 kt of nickel and copper, respectively (Barcan 2002). By 1963, aerial pollution had destroyed forests up to 7 km from the smelter (Pozniakov 1993), and at present, areas of dead forest reach up to 15 km south and 10 km north of the smelter (Kryuchkov 1993; Mikkola 1996b). More than 10,000 km2 have been affected by large-scale environmental deterioration, and vast areas of previously healthy forest within 400 km2 of the smelter have been transformed into secondary open habitats (conventionally named industrial barrens) with extremely low (<5%) vegetation cover and high physical stress (Kryuchkov 1993; Mikkola 1996a; Rigina & Kozlov 1999).
These barrens exhibit a unique combination of environmental characteristics, including: low vegetation cover due to disturbance-related fragmentation of ground-layer vegetation, increased light availability due to forest decline, low mineral nutrition due to displacement of base cations by heavy metals, and harsh microclimate, in particular increased wind speed and deep soil freezing due to thin snow cover (Koroleva 1993; Kryuchkov 1993; Kozlov & Haukioja 1997; Derome & Nieminen 1998; Lukina & Nikonov 1999; Rigina & Kozlov 1999; Winterhalder 2000; Kozlov 2001, 2002; Zvereva & Kozlov 2001). Low soil temperatures (circa -10ÂºC) during winter have been found to negatively affect Mountain birch growth (Weih & Karlsson 2002), and wind stress has often been considered as a factor decreasing plant performance, also in conjunction with pollution (Carlsson & Callaghan 1991; Hoad et al. 1998; Zvereva & Kozlov 2004).
Mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii (Orlova) HÁ¤met-Ahti) is one of the few woody plants surviving in industrial barrens, where it grows as low-stature, multi-stem bushes (Kryuchkov 1993). As the tree line-forming species in northern Europe, Mountain birch is resilient and can withstand the harsh climatic conditions of cold, windy habitats. Even severe pollution, associated with both an increase in the impact of climate stress and a decrease in environmental capacity, was not found to decrease the sexual reproduction of Mountain birch in terms of proportion of reproducing trees, reproductive effort, catkin weight, and seed germinability (Kozlov & Zvereva 2004). However, no natural recruitment of this species has been observed in industrial barrens during the past decades (Kozlov & Haukioja 1999; Rigina & Kozlov 1999). The persistence of Mountain birch populations near strong sources of pollution may, thus, be transient, and a complete decline of birch populations on heavily contaminated soils may be prevented only by artificial reforestation. Past attempts at sowing Mountain birch seeds, however, resulted in 100% mortality by the end of the first growth season (Kozlov 2005a), and the survival of unprotected Mountain birch seedlings planted near the Severonikel smelter is very low, even down to 0 – 10% (Pankratova 1991; Kozlov & Haukioja 1999). Thus, although Mountain birch is a potential species for reforestation of industrial barrens, there is a clear need to find ways to mitigate the impact of diverse stressors co-occurring in industrial barrens in order to assure restoration success. Due to the influence of the warm Gulf Stream current, the Kola Peninsula has a relatively mild and stable climate and is free of permafrost. The climate is normally cool, with low summer and winter air temperatures: the average temperature in January is -8Â°C along the northern coast and -12 to -15Â°C in the centre of the peninsula. Winter is characterized by frequent blizzards, causing large snowdrifts, while summer is short, lasting only a few months, and is generally cool and rainy, with average June temperatures ranging from 8 to 14Â°C. Three-quarters of all precipitation occurs between June and October, with an annual total of 400 mm. February is the coldest and windiest month, and July is the warmest and most calm. In winter, the sun remains below the horizon between 1 December and 13 January (at Murmansk), and in summer, the sun does not set between 23 May and 21 July (at Murmansk). In the south this period is shorter, only lasting from 2 June to 11 July.
Up to the mid-1930s, descriptions of the Kola Peninsula spoke of virgin pine forest and impenetrable spruce forest with “˜beards’ of pollution-sensitive epiphytic lichens covering the area a few kilometers to the south of the present-day city of Monchegorsk. Indeed, forests cover about half of the peninsula, ranging from northwest to southeast, and are composed of coniferous trees such as Scots pine and Norway spruce, and deciduous trees such as birch, mountain ash, and alder. Prior to construction of the smelter in 1938, mountain birch comprised part of a mixed forest that covered the study area, together with Scots pine and Norway spruce (Bobrova & Kachurin 1936). To evaluate the effect of physical sheltering on the survival and performance of Mountain birch seedlings planted on severely contaminated industrial barren sites.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Five blocks, circa 8 x 15 m, were established at each site, with nine treatments in each block. From four to seven (median = 5) seedlings were assigned into each treatment in each block at an average distance of 10 cm from one another. The average amount of seedlings was 59 per treatment for a total of 530 experimental seedlings, 243 in site 1 and 287 in site 2. The seedlings were planted at site 1 on 5 June 1999 and at site 2 on 2 June 1999. As a source population, seedlings from a relatively unpolluted site 63 km southeast of the Severonikel smelter were used (lat 67Âº32'16""N, long 33Âº57'52""E). The seedlings were 3 - 10 cm tall and were naturally recruited in a belt of sandy soil exposed some 15 years ago by road construction. Care was taken to distribute seedlings of different height evenly among treatments and blocks (i.e., experimental units). The seedlings were planted bare-rooted, with a minimum amount of native soil inserted.

In addition to control (C), each block included eight treatments with natural or artificial stress ameliorators: liming (L), boxing (B), a combination of liming and boxing (LB), watering (W), a combination of watering and boxing (WB), partial shelter (PS), full shelter (FS), and stone (St). Liming treatment consisted of a one-time addition of 40 g of granulated (grain size 1 - 3 mm) dolomitic limestone (CaMg(CO3)2, with 17% Ca and 5% Mg; Kemira Growhow Oyj, Helsinki, Finland) into an area of 1 m2 around the seedlings at the time of planting. This was done to achieve a more natural pH in the soil and also to minimize heavy metal uptake by the seedlings. Watering treatment was done at the time of planting and every second day for the first 5 weeks of the experiment, excluding rainy days. Local pond water was used to irrigate the seedlings, with 2 L added to an area of 1 m2 around them. Irrigation was added to check for the effect of drought because in industrial barrens, where shading is very low, soil moisture is reduced on average to 75% relative to undisturbed habitats (Kozlov, unpublished data). Boxing treatment consisted of circling the seedlings with a wooden fence 25 cm high and 25 x 40 cm in surface area. Partial and full shelters were 25-cm-high and 40-cm-wide wooden windbreaks placed between the seedlings and the smelter at a distance of circa 15 cm from the seedlings. Full shelters were solid, whereas partial shelters had 6-cm-wide horizontal gaps in the middle and at the bottom (i.e., 50% permeable). In the stone treatment, seedlings were planted within a 30-cm distance of a natural rock 15 - 90 cm high and 30 - 110 cm wide so that the rock was located between the seedlings and the smelter. Treatments involving boxing, shelters, and stone were designed to improve the microclimate around the seedlings and to see whether a natural (and thus no-cost) shelter would benefit the seedlings, or whether an artificial (and thus costly) shelter is necessary.

The effects of the treatments on microclimate were tested in the summer of 1999. Wind velocity in each experimental unit was measured six times between 15 June and 14 August using Kestrel Pocket Wind Meter (Nielsen-Kellerman, Chester, PA, U.S.A.; speed range 0.3 - 40 m/second, accuracy 0.1 m/second or 3% of reading for velocities exceeding 3.5 m/second). Measurements within the study site were performed in a random order, simultaneously by two wind meters placed at a height of 2 m (wvc) and at the level of seedling crowns (wvt), with impellers perpendicular to the wind direction. Average wind speeds were recorded from 10 seconds measurements. The relative wind velocity was calculated as wvt/wvc x 100%.

To check whether sheltering had any effect on the amount of rainfall reaching soil near the seedlings, transparent plastic vials (38 and 70 mm in diameter and height, respectively) were placed next to the experimental seedlings, and the amount of water in each vial was checked after episodes of heavy rain, five times in site 1 and seven times in site 2.

Illumination was measured six times during the summer with a Panlux electronic luxmeter (Gossen, NÁ¼rnberg, Germany). The measurements were conducted next to seedling crowns (it) and at an open site next to them at a height of 1.5 m (ic) in heavily cloudy days to avoid the effects of random shadows. Relative illumination (it/ic x 100%) was calculated for each pair of measurements.

The survivors in each experimental unit were counted five times during the summer of 1999, at the beginning and at the end of growing seasons from 2000 to 2002, and at the end of the growing season in 2004. Performance indexes--i.e. lengths of two largest leaves (without the petiole) and all long shoots (e.g., shoots that grow tens of millimeters long and bear leaves that expand one after another following shoot elongation)--were measured late in the growing season (when leaves were fully matured and shoot growth had ceased) in years 1999 - 2002 and 2004, and seedling heights in 2000, 2001, and 2004. In 2000 and 2001, chlorophyll fluorescence was measured from two intact leaves per seedling in field conditions using a portable plant stress meter (Biomonitor S.C.I. AB, UmeÁ¥, Sweden) with light level 200 lmol photons m-2 second-1. The indexes measured were the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence yielded under the artificial light treatment (Fv/Fm) and the time needed for the leaf to reach half of its Fm (T1/2). To make sure that maximum level of fluorescence was reached, the leaves were dark adapted for 15 minutes with a lightweight leaf cuvette. Larger values of Fv/Fm and smaller values of T1/2 were considered to be representative of faster growth and less stress and thus higher fitness (Á–quist & Wass 1988). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Both boxing and full shelter reduced wind velocity to 40 and 73% of control, respectively. Similarly, boxing and full shelter both reduced illumination to 56 and 92% relative to control, respectively. None of the treatments influenced the amount of rainfall reaching the ground.

Liming had a strong positive effect on birch seedlings; only seedlings in liming treatments survived until 2004 at site 1 (mortality 60%), and at site 2, average survival in liming treatments was double, relative to control by 2004. At site 1, all control seedlings were dead by 2001, and when analyzing survival until 2000, only liming had a significant positive effect. Moreover, the growth of survivors was enhanced, as indicated by larger leaf size, increased long shoot length (by 81%), and tripled vertical increment. Mitigation of environmental stress by liming was also indicated by lower T1/2 values, although Fv/Fm values were not affected.

Effects of boxing were generally non-significant, although in the first year, boxing increased leaf length by 15%. The only consistent positive effects were detected on Fv/Fm and T1/2. Fv/Fm increased by 30% in 2000 and 13% in 2001, and T1/2 decreased by 24% in 2000 and by 12% in 2001. Marginally significant interactions were found between liming and boxing on seedling height and T1/2, with the two treatments being less beneficial together than separately.

Site had a pronounced effect on most of the investigated variables; both survival and growth were lower at site 1. No differences were found between summer and winter mortality. The effects of both treatments were differently expressed at the two study sites. In seedling height analysis, year x site x liming interaction was marginally significant, with liming benefiting seedlings only at site 2, increasing height by 58, 176, and 243% in 2000, 2001, and 2004, respectively.

Although partial shelter (PS) and stone (St) increased seedling survival at site 2, only full shelter (FS) had a statistically significant beneficial effect on seedling performance. Full shelter increased leaf length by 11% and height by 12% relative to control. Also, both partial shelter and stone had a marginally significant positive effect on leaf length, both increasing it by 10% relative to control. All dependent variables showed pronounced inter-year variation at site 2. At site 1, the inter-year pattern was generally the same as at site 2; however, the differences were not significant, presumably due to the low number of survivors. Neither performance nor survival until 2000 was increased by any mode of sheltering at site 1. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: In spite of greatly reducing wind stress experienced by the seedlings, boxing had no positive effect on survival and had only a small positive effect on performance during the first growing season. Only the chlorophyll fluorescence measurements showed a decrease in stress in the boxing treatment. These results are in contrast with the conclusions of an earlier study conducted in the same site by Kozlov & Haukioja (1999), which demonstrated a positive effect of boxing on the performance and survival of Mountain birch seedlings. The most plausible explanation for the discrepancy in the results of the two experiments is that the emissions from Severonikel smelter have decreased since the time of the previous study (Barcan 2002). Thus, the effect of airborne pollution, acting synergistically with wind stress (Hoad et al. 1998), relative to soil pollution has decreased. Also, among-year variation in weather conditions may have contributed to the differences in results. Finally, we monitored the birch seedlings for five growth seasons compared to only two growth seasons in the earlier study (Kozlov & Haukioja 1999); boxing indeed increased leaf length in the first year of the experiment, but this beneficial effect was gone the following years.

There are also other possible explanations for the low effect of boxing compared to the other shelters: (1) in early winter the drifting snow may accumulate outside, not inside the boxes, and thus the seedlings can be vulnerable to freezing and (2) microclimate changes caused by boxing (e.g., shading) may have had negative effects on the birch seedlings. Shading is expected to increase plant growth, and this has been shown to be the case also with birch seedlings (Aphalo & Lehto 1997; Van Hees & Clerkx 2003). However, an increase in growth may have accelerated heavy metal accumulation and reduced survival. If the fastest growing individuals were the first to die, then this could explain why the beneficial effects of boxing were not evident in height data either. However, boxing did not increase growth or survival even in conjunction with liming, which casts doubt on the last explanation. It must be noted, however, that the limed seedlings outgrew the boxes (25 cm high) by the end of the experiment. During the last years of the experiment, both the protection offered and the shading imposed by boxing may have been negligible. The chlorophyll fluorescence data give some support to this explanation, with the beneficial effects of boxing being twice as strong in 2000 as in 2001. 

It is, however, important to note that shading is known to increase the proportional importance of photosystem II compared to photosystem I (BjÁ¶rkman 1981; Anderson & Osmond 1987). Because chlorophyll fluorescence measures plant condition via the efficiency of photosystem II, it may simply be that the chlorophyll fluorescence measurements reflected the effects of shading on the physiology of Mountain birch seedlings, even though other factors were more critical to their survival and performance.
The data obtained in this study provided partial support for the hypothesis that mitigation of physical stressors by sheltering increases the performance Mountain birch seedlings planted in a heavily polluted barren site that has soil nickel and copper concentrations of up to 4,000 and 2,000 Î¼g/g, respectively (Barkan 1993). Although liming produced stronger positive effects, the beneficial effects of full shelter, partial shelter, and stone on survival and performance were evident at site 2. The positive effects of a natural shelter (stone) were of similar magnitude as with artificial shelters. At site 1, where winter snow cover was thinner and soil water content lower than in site 2, sheltering was not sufficient to overcome these stressors and seedling mortality was 100%.
Absence of differences between summer and winter mortality suggests that the positive effects of sheltering are not restricted to the growing season. Various shelters are likely not only to mitigate wind stress during the growth season but also to protect seedlings from freezing via trapping snow drifting over the barren site at the beginning of winter. Causality is further obscured by the fact that protection from freezing not only improves winter survival but can also increase seedling performance during the following summer (Weih & Karlsson 2002) and vice versa: good summer conditions positively affect winter survival (Weih & Karlsson 1999).
As expected, liming had a strong positive effect on Mountain birch survival and performance, verifying the negative effects of soil contamination on the seedlings. Even the small doses used in the current experiment, 40 g/m2 compared to 1,000 g/m2 in the Sudbury restoration program (Lautenbach et al. 1995), increased the growth of birch seedlings 3-fold. Heavy metal toxicity is often associated with a deficiency of essential nutrients and problems in water uptake (Jones & Hutchinson 1988; Barcelo & Poschenrieder 1990; Kozlov et al. 1999). Thus, the effects of liming were most likely not restricted to reduction of soil toxicity alone. This view is supported by the fact that liming was especially crucial at site 1 and sheltering was beneficial only at site 2, although site 1 is less polluted but dried and more oligotrophic than site 2.
In conclusion, the results of the study indicate that under the environmental conditions and current level of emissions (circa 40 kt of SO2 annually) at the experimental site, soil quality/toxicity influences the long-term performance of Mountain birch more than physical stress. Consequently, liming, which reduces soil toxicity and increases its nutritional quality, is clearly needed to assure successful restoration. This does not mean, however, that positive effects could not be achieved by physical sheltering. Indeed, sheltering, even by natural windbreaks such as large stones, may well be a useful tool in reforestation when the environment is not so harsh as to cause 100% mortality during the first few years of plant development and when liming is for some reason not a feasible option. The data gathered in this study imply that when assessing plant performance in polluted habitats, it is important to monitor the plants for several years. Survival data from site 2 illustrate this statement exceptionally clearly: no treatments had any effect on survival by the year 2000, and only by 2004 did the effects of various treatments become apparent. Another finding is the need to measure several performance parameters because they can respond to treatments differently. Chlorophyll fluorescence–which is a widely used index in the assessment of plant stress, including stress imposed by pollution (Adams et al. 1989; Kitao et al. 1997; Odasz-Albrigtsen et al. 2000), and has been shown to correlate strongly with the CO2 metabolism of a wide range of plants, including birch (Krause & Weis 1991; Ball et al. 1995; Govindjee 1995)–gave very different results from growth and survival measurements. In this experiment, the seemingly low stress in boxing treatments (as indicated by chlorophyll fluorescence data) was not evident in growth parameters or survival. It may be that the beneficial effects of the boxing treatment (e.g., alleviated wind stress or protection from freezing) were overcome by excess growth, accumulation of pollutants, or some other factors. Another possibility is that shading had no effect on performance characteristics or survival but merely affected chlorophyll fluorescence measurements via the ratio of photosystems I and II as discussed earlier. In any case, had the analysis of results relied solely on chlorophyll fluorescence data or growth data, the interpretations of this study would have been drastically different. "

Se evaluó durante un año el efecto de tratamientos de deshierbe y fertilización, sobre el desempeño de plántulas de seis especies arbóreas nativas medido en términos de supervivencia y crecimiento. A partir de la época de sequía la probabilidad de supervivencia de las plántulas aumentó bajo la cobertura de los pastos (tratamiento sin deshierbe), tanto de especies demandantes de luz como tolerantes de sombra. Las plántulas de las especies de hábito heliófilo Ceiba pentandra, Schizolobium parahyba y Swietenia macrophylla tuvieron mayores niveles de supervivencia y crecimiento, con respecto a las umbrófilas Brosimum alicastrum, Calophyllum brasiliense y Ormosia schippii. La tasa relativa de crecimiento (TRC) en altura y diámetro varió significativamente para el efecto simple del deshierbe y de la especie. El efecto simple del deshierbe indicó un mayor crecimiento en altura y diámetro de las plantas en el tratamiento con deshierbe. No se registraron efectos significativos de la fertilización en el desempeño de las plantas. El efecto de la especie fue el factor más consistente para explicar la varianza en las tres variables de respuesta. Esto indica que las especies arbóreas estudiadas tuvieron determinadas trayectorias de supervivencia y crecimiento, al margen del efecto de los tratamientos aplicados.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation El proceso de deforestación en el trópico húmedo suele iniciar con la extracción de madera comercial, a lo que le sigue el desmonte de la selva y la utilización del terreno por unos pocos años en agricultura de temporal, dedicándolo luego a pastizal permanente (Masera, 1996; Vásquez-Sánchez et al., 1992). La ausencia de cobertura arbórea, el pisoteo constante del ganado en suelos arcillosos y la elevada precipitación en las regiones tropicales húmedas, propician la degradación del suelo en términos de sus propiedades físicas y químicas. Entre ellas destacan la compactación del suelo, la lixiviación de nutrientes y la pérdida de la materia orgánica (Loker, 1994). La compactación del suelo por sobrepastoreo es una de las condiciones de degradación de mayor importancia en bosques y selvas de México, estimadas en un total 59 millones de hectáreas de tierras compactadas, que representa el 30% de la superficie total de tierras degradadas (Chapela, 1999).
El suelo donde se estableció la parcela experimental es arcilloso, deficiente en fósforo y con una alta densidad aparente (1.1 g/ml), de acuerdo con el muestreo realizado durante el presente estudio. Este valor se incluye dentro del intervalo (1.0-1.7 g/ml) definido como indicador de compactación en suelos arcillosos (AgÁ¼ero & Alvarado, 1983; Donahue et al., 1983). Durante los meses de mayor precipitación pluvial (Agosto-Septiembre) la parcela se encontró inundada, y por otro lado, en la estación seca se formaron grietas de aprox. 15 cm de profundidad. Batey & McKenzie (2006) mencionaron que el drenaje deficiente puede ser una consecuencia de la compactación en la superficie del suelo.
El terreno fue ocupado como potrero durante 30 años a partir del desmonte de la selva. El sitio fue selva alta hasta el año de 1969, la cual fue tumbada y quemada para su aprovechamiento agrícola durante siete años. A partir del año 1976 hasta la fecha, el área fue sembrada con pasto “estrella” para su aprovechamiento pecuario. La Selva Lacandona se caracteriza por su alta diversidad de especies, ya que mantiene 25% de la biodiversidad total de México, en un área menor al 1% de la superficie del país (Medellín 1996). Se estima que ahí existen aprox 4,314 especies de plantas vasculares lo que representa 19% de la diversidad de México (Martínez et al. 1994); 340 especies de aves (migratorias y residentes; 30% de las especies mexicanas; González-García 1993) y 800 especies de mariposas diurnas (36% del total para el país; De la Maza y De la Maza 1991). Los mamíferos de la región incluyen 117 especies, lo que constituye 27% de las especies terrestres de México (López 1998, Medellín 1994). Entre otros puntos importantes, es una de las pocas áreas de Mesoamérica con poblaciones aún viables de especies con problemas de conservación (e.g. jaguar, tapir, mono araña y mono aullador; Vera-Rivera 1990) y para algunas especies su única población en México se encuentra en esta región, ejemplo de ello son las especies Metachirus nudicaudatus (tlacuache), Cabassous centralis (armadillo), Tonatia bidens (murciélago; Medellín 1994). La meta del presente trabajo fue evaluar alternativas para el manejo de la sucesión secundaria, que faciliten y aceleren el establecimiento inicial de especies arbóreas nativas en un pastizal degradado.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: El principal criterio para la selección de las especies fue que éstas pertenecieran a diferentes fases de la sucesión secundaria. Se incluyeron por un lado, especies heliófilas de semillas ortodoxas dispersadas por el viento, típicas de fases iniciales e intermedias de la sucesión. Por otro lado, se tomaron en cuenta especies umbrófilas de semillas recalcitrantes dispersadas por mamíferos, típicas de las fases tardías de la sucesión.

El potrero seleccionado estaba en uso al iniciarse el presente estudio, por lo que la parcela fue cercada con alambre de púas para excluir al ganado del área experimental. Asimismo, se eliminó la vegetación superficial del potrero con el uso de machetes, para homogeneizar la cobertura inicial. Con la ayuda de cavadores se hicieron perforaciones en la tierra de aprox. 30 x 30 x 30 cm a intervalos de dos metros. El transplante a la parcela se realizó el día 5 de septiembre del año 2005, dentro del periodo principal de lluvias. El diseño experimental fue factorial en bloques completamente aleatorizados (DBCA), donde el deshierbe y la fertilización fueron los factores fijos, con dos niveles por cada factor (presencia y ausencia). Las parcelas y la posición de las especies en su interior fueron aleatorizadas en 15 bloques, cada uno con cuatro parcelas de 6 x 4 m y un individuo por especie a un distanciamiento de 2 x 2 m. Así, se instalaron en total 60 parcelas y fueron plantados 360 individuos en un área de 2,226 m2. 

El tratamiento de fertilización se inició al momento de la plantación, en la mitad de las parcelas designadas aleatoriamente en el diseño. En la base de hoyos de 20 x 20 x 30 cm se aplicó un fertilizante granular inorgánico comercial (N-P-K=20-30-10) en una dosis de 60 g por planta, el cual fue elegido por la deficiencia de fósforo en el suelo donde se estableció la parcela experimental.

El tratamiento de deshierbe se aplicó durante los primeros seis meses del establecimiento (septiembre 2005 - febrero 2006) a todos los individuos transplantados. Luego continuó los siguientes seis meses solamente en las parcelas con este tratamiento, realizándose una limpieza con machete alrededor de las plántulas en un radio de un metro. El deshierbe fue bimestral durante la temporada seca y mensual en tiempo de lluvias cuando crece a mayor velocidad.

La parcela fue evaluada cada 90 días. La primera evaluación se realizó al iniciar el experimento y se efectuaron un total de cinco mediciones a lo largo de un año. En cada una se evaluó la supervivencia y el crecimiento de las plantas. La supervivencia se registró mediante el conteo de los individuos y se anotaron las posibles causas de mortalidad (daños por insectos u hongos, desecación, daño mecánico). La altura de las plantas se obtuvo midiendo con un flexómetro desde la base del tallo hasta la yema apical. El diámetro basal se midió con un vernier calibrado con precisión de 0.05 mm. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: SUPERVIVENCIA
La supervivencia de las plantas al final del experimento varió significativamente entre bloques y en la interacción de bloque con tratamiento. Esto implica que hubo mayor mortalidad en ciertos bloques, la cual se incrementó en la interacción con el deshierbe. Estas diferencias posiblemente se debieron a un efecto de gradiente ambiental relacionado con la compactación y humedad del suelo, generando en algunas zonas condiciones contrastantes de saturación durante la estación lluviosa y de sequedad extrema durante la estación seca. 

También se econtraron diferencias significativas para el efecto simple del deshierbe y de la especie. Lo primero resultó en que la supervivencia de las plantas fuera mayor en el tratamiento sin deshierbe, lo cual explica el por qué no se encontraron diferencias significativas en la interacción con la especie. Las especies más afectadas fueron S. parahyba, C. brasiliense y O. schippii. No se registraron efectos significativos por efecto de la fertilización.

En términos generales, la supervivencia fue buena en la época de lluvias y la mayor parte de la mortalidad (> 70%) se dio entre los 180 y 270 días posteriores al transplante, periodo correspondiente con la estación seca y con la aplicación del tratamiento sin deshierbe. Un 20% de la mortalidad fue afectada por el corte accidental de la planta con machete al momento de aplicar el deshierbe y otro 10% fue atribuido al estrés sufrido por las plántulas al momento del transplante. Los resultados indican que el establecimiento de las plántulas es bueno manteniendo el área deshierbada durante los primeros seis meses después del transplante (septiembre-febrero), y dejándolas sin deshierbe durante la época de sequía (marzo-junio). 

CRECIMIENTO
La tasa relativa de crecimiento (TRC) en altura varió significativamente para el efecto simple del deshierbe y de la especie. En cuanto a la TRC en diámetro basal se encontraron diferencias significativas por efecto del deshierbe, y de la especie. No se registraron diferencias significativas para el efecto de bloque y tratamiento, ni para el de la fertilización. En ambos atributos de crecimiento la mayor parte de la varianza fue explicada por el efecto de la especie y en menor medida por el deshierbe.

El efecto simple del deshierbe indicó un mayor crecimiento en altura y diámetro de las plantas en el tratamiento con deshierbe. La diferenciación del crecimiento de las plantas por el deshierbe fue evidente a partir de los 180 días, fecha en que inició la aplicación del tratamiento sin deshierbe. En altura las respuestas más notorias fueron de S. parahyba y C. brasiliense. En diámetro las respuestas significativas también fueron de S. parahyba y C. brasiliense, así como de C. pentandra. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: La principal causa de mortalidad de las plantas puede ser atribuida a la desecación, ya que durante la estación de menor precipitación (marzo-junio), se observó la formación de grietas en el suelo desnudo de las plantas con deshierbe. Estos resultados son consistentes con otros estudios que reportan que la mayor parte de la mortalidad de especies arbóreas que establecieron en zonas agropecuarias degradadas fue registrada durante la estación seca (Ramírez-Marcial, 2003; Hau & Corlett, 2003; Alvarez-Aquino et al., 2004). Sin embargo, los resultados pueden ser contrastantes con lo reportado usualmente sobre que el deshierbe favorece el establecimiento de plántulas forestales por la disminución de la competencia con los pastos (Holl et al., 2000; Zimmerman et al., 2000). El deshierbe si bien reduce la competencia también ocasiona que se hagan más extremas las condiciones de luminosidad, temperatura y falta de humedad, sobre todo durante la estación seca. Al quedar el suelo desnudo en la superficie, se incrementan los niveles de mortalidad por causa de la desecación (Nepstad et al., 1996; Hooper et al., 2002). Al respecto, Hernández-X. (1981) menciona que de acuerdo con el conocimiento agrícola tradicional maya del manejo del maíz, no es bueno el deshierbe en temporada de sequía porque las hierbas protegen al maíz del sol. En este sentido, los resultados coinciden en que es posible que las especies umbrófilas tengan una mayor capacidad para sobrevivir bajo la cobertura de los pastos (Hooper et al., 2002; Rodríguez, 2005; Martínez-Garza et al., 2005). Sin embargo, de acuerdo con la respuesta de S. parahyba es posible que ante las severas condiciones de la estación seca, inclusive las especies demandantes de luz puedan ser favorecidas bajo una cobertura moderada de pastos.

Se observó un patrón de trueque o ""trade-off"" dado por el efecto del deshierbe, de forma negativa en la supervivencia y positiva en ambas variables de crecimiento. Este intercambio puede significar la pérdida de algunos individuos a cambio de alcanzar un mayor crecimiento a plena luz o viceversa. Según Baraloto et al. (2005) una forma de trueque, puede estar relacionada con el desempeño diferencial de una especie en microambientes contrastantes de luz o disponibilidad de agua. Estos canjes pueden tener una repercusión importante en la silvicultura y el manejo de especies forestales, así como en el entendimiento de la plasticidad y adaptación de las especies a ambientes perturbados (Poorter et al., 2005).

El no efecto de la fertilización puede responder a que su aplicación en condiciones saturadas pudo haber mermado su efecto por la disolución de sales, como también pudo haber contaminación entre parcelas y bloques. Al respecto Siemann & Rogers (2003) mencionan que las propiedades físicas del suelo como la compactación pueden ser determinantes en la absorción de fertilizantes por plantas arbóreas. Es posible también que la composición del fertilizante rica en fósforo no haya sido la adecuada para dichas especies.
Las condiciones de degradación en el área experimental, definidas en términos de compactación del suelo y deficiencia de algunos nutrimentos, historial de uso prolongado y baja productividad, no fueron un obstáculo infranqueable para el establecimiento de las plántulas. El manejo de la vegetación de pastizales mediante deshierbes selectivos, puede proveer varias alternativas en el establecimiento de especies nativas con diferente historia de vida y estatus sucesional (Davis et al., 1998).
La supervivencia de las plántulas es buena en épocas de alta precipitación (mes de septiembre), sin la cobertura de pastos y manteniéndose con deshierbe a lo largo de la época de lluvias. A partir de la época de sequía (marzo-junio) la probabilidad de supervivencia de las plántulas es mayor bajo la cobertura de los pastos, tanto de especies demandantes de luz como tolerantes de sombra.
Las plántulas de las especies de hábito heliófilo Ceiba pentandra, Schizolobium parahyba y Swietenia macrophylla tuvieron altos niveles de supervivencia, mientras que las umbrófilas fueron más afectadas por la mortalidad, de manera intermedia en Brosimum alicastrum y Calophyllum brasiliense, y drásticamente en Ormosia schippii.
El efecto de la especie fue el factor más consistente para explicar la varianza en las tres variables de respuesta (supervivencia, crecimiento en diámetro y en altura). Esto indica que las especies arbóreas estudiadas tuvieron determinadas trayectorias de supervivencia y crecimiento en la condición ambiental en que fueron establecidas, al margen del efecto de los tratamientos aplicados.

This study investigated methods for restoring native wet tropical forest on a degraded site in the Ebano Verde Scientific Reserve, located in the central highlands of the Dominican Republic. Fern cover was manually removed from the site, and then a trial planting of 18 nursery-reared native tree and shrub species was conducted. The seedlings were planted in high densities in order to offset the effects of seedling mortality and inhibit the reestablishment of the fern. Monitoring conducted over a period of three years found high rates of survival and positive growth, and showed the plantation of woody species to be a viable option for complementing forest succession and accelerating restoration on these disturbed sites.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) At present, the Ebano Verde Scientific Reserve contains species-poor secondary forest concentrated along streams (Slocum et al. 2000), and small, isolated patches of mature forest that contain the majority of the reserve’s woody species (274 species; García et al. 1994). Besides these forests, the reserve contains expansive thickets of Dicranopteris pectinata (Willd.) Underw. (Gleicheniaceae), which colonized in the 1970s after logging, agriculture, burning, and subsequent soil erosion (García et al. 1994). Although precise estimates of cover for the thickets over the entire reserve are not known, 90% of the southwestern part of the reserve is covered by the fern (Slocum et al. 2000). In these areas, the thickets consist of a layer of living fronds, a layer of dead fronds and stems, and a root mat. The few trees and shrubs in the fern thickets are small, occur at low densities, and consist of only approximately 25 species (García et al. 1994; Slocum et al. 2000). These trees presumably arrived and grew to a sufficient height before the fern canopy was fully established, as regeneration under the thickets is extremely limited (Slocum et al. 2004). Similar thickets of D. pectinata, and its congener, D. linearis (Burm. f.) Underw., are found on disturbed sites throughout the tropics and have similar inhibitive effects on native woody vegetation (Walker 1994; Cohen et al. 1995; Walker & Boneta 1995; Mejía & Jiménez 1998; Russell et al. 1998). To restore anthropogenic fern thickets to a species composition representative of the region’s previously extant montane forest.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Selection of woody plant species was based on several criteria. First, species were sought that already grew commonly in the thickets and therefore showed potential to grow and survive after fern removal. Seven such species were found, six early-successional and one late-successional (Slocum et al. 2004). Secondly, in order to maximize the chances of finding some species that would have good rates of growth and survivorship, roughly equal numbers of early- and late-successional species of both trees and shrubs were collected. Life history assignments were based on the habitats the species colonized (Weaver 1986; García et al. 1994; Slocum et al. 2000). Lastly, only species that were common in the southwestern part of the reserve were selected, in order that their seeds and seedlings could be easily collected both for this study and for future efforts, and to ensure that their collection would not cause further degradation in the reserve.

Seedlings were collected from November 1998 to January 1999 and grown until early June 1999. They were grown in nursery bags (4.5 x 10 x 12 cm) in a shade house (50% incident sunlight). They were regularly watered and fertilized with poultry litter (poultry manure mixed with bedding material) bearing the following nutrient composition: 18 Â± 0.9 g/kg N, 14 Â± 0.5 g/kg P, and 21 Â± 0.3 g/kg K (mean Â± 1 SD, n 1/4 3). Before out-planting, all plants were placed outside of the shade house for two weeks to adjust them to full sunlight. At the time of planting (mid-June 1999), seedlings selected for out-planting were robust (mean Â± 1 SD, 20 Â± 11 cm tall, n 1/4 2,280).

For out-planting, three blocks were randomly located along an old logging road in the southwest part of the reserve. These blocks (each approximately 45 x 30 m) were located more than 100 m away from the road and approximately 250 m from each other. These blocks all had different aspects and slopes and were representative of fern thickets in this part of the reserve; but they may not be representative of thickets on steeper slopes or at higher elevations.

In the blocks, thickets were removed using machetes between January and March 1999. Ferns were cut to the root layer, and the debris was piled up into rows 1 - 2 m apart, leaving cleared rows in between. As much as possible, these rows were placed along contour lines to minimize erosion. Erosion was also reduced by not removing the root mat; however, the root mat was cut to reduce the likelihood of resprouting.

Along the cleared rows, seedlings were planted 1 m apart. This high density was used because high mortality was anticipated and because it was anticipated that a large number of seedlings would be needed to shade out recolonizing fern. In each block, approximately 50 seedlings of each species were planted, and half were fertilized with approximately 100 mL of poultry litter placed at the bottom of the planting hole. No additional fertilizer was applied after planting. The position of each seedling along the cleared rows was random, regardless of its species or fertilizer treatment. Plant height was measured at the time of planting, and plant height and mortality were determined 12, 24, and 36 months after planting.

To understand how clearing the fern affected soils, cores of soil (12 cm deep x 5 cm diameter) were collected in the cleared blocks and compared to those collected in nearby thickets. For each block, six randomly selected points along its edges were selected. At each point, a core was taken 3 m into the cleared block and 3 m into the thicket. A total of 36 cores were collected (3 blocks x 2 fern treatments x 6 replicates).

The effect of fern removal on foliar nutrient concentrations was determined by collecting leaves from adult trees of Myrsine coriacea and Brunellia comocladifolia. It was assumed that these trees were approximately 25 years old because they appeared to have established when agricultural activities ceased, and before the fern thickets became fully established (Slocum et al. 2004). Three years after clearing (June 2002), two recently matured leaves were collected from three trees of each species in each block. In the adjacent thickets, leaves were also collected from three trees of each species, for a total of 36 samples (3 blocks x 2 fern treatments x 2 tree species x 3 replicates).

For out-planting, three blocks were randomly located along an old logging road in the southwest part of the reserve. These blocks (each approximately 45 x 30 m) were located more than 100 m away from the road and approximately 250 m from each other. These blocks all had different aspects and slopes and were representative of fern thickets in this part of the reserve; but they may not be representative of thickets on steeper slopes or at higher elevations. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The soils in the cleared blocks did not significantly differ from those in the thickets overall, nor did foliar nutrient concentrations for either of the two tested tree species, Myrsine coriacea or Brunellia comocladifolia. Soils in the clearings and thickets both had a pH of 4.6--typical of a highly weathered tropical soil (Motavalli et al. 1995)--and a cation exchange capacity of 15 cmol/kg. In fact, levels of exchangeable cations were high compared to other tropical soils (Silver et al. 1994; Motavalli et al. 1995; Menzies & Gillman 1997; Davidson et al. 1998), particularly for exchangeable Ca. Soils at the study site were rich in carbon (Silver et al. 1994; Tian 1998; Tornquist et al. 1999) but had low to moderate total N (2.6 g/kg) (González & Fisher 1994; Silver et al. 1994; Motavalli et al. 1995; Tornquist et al. 1999), resulting in a high C:N ratio of 16 (Erickson et al. 2001). Available NH4-N and NO3-N also appeared in low to moderate levels (Davidson et al. 1998; Erickson et al. 2001), as did available phosphate. 

After three years, overall mortality of the woody plants was 21%. Mortality was not significantly affected by block, fertilizer, or any of their interactions. There was, however, a significant species by fertilizer interaction. Only one species, Piper aduncum, had significantly greater mortality (73%) when not fertilized. The strongest effect was that of species, as almost no seedlings of Inga fagifolia died, whereas more than 50% of the seedlings of Cyrilla racemiflora and B. comocladifolia died. Some species appeared to have higher mortality in the first year, including B. comocladifolia, Myrcia deflexa, Prestoea acuminata var. montana, Turpinia occidentalis, and Psychotria berteriana. Others species had constant mortality over all three years, including C. racemiflora, Ocotea leucoxylon, Clidemia umbellata, and P. aduncum. There was no clear effect of life history on woody seedling mortality.

Plant height increase after three years was observed in an increment of 0.3 to 3.4 m, and was significantly affected by both species and the interaction of species with fertilizer. Although fertilizer led to an overall 10-cm height increase for all species combined, this was statistically significant for only one species, B. comocladifolia, which had the highest mean height increase of the tested species and which grew 73 cm/year faster when fertilized. Average plant height increase was 126 Â± 103 cm, with 28% of the plants growing more than 2 m in height. Early-successional species grew about twice as rapidly as late-successional species (153 Â± 103 vs. 81 Â± 67 cm), whereas trees grew 25% faster than shrubs (141 Â± 105 vs. 111 Â± 90 cm). The six species with the most rapid height increase included five early-successional species (B. comocladifolia, P. berteriana, Alchornea latifolia, C. umbellata, and M. coriacea), and one late-successional species (I. fagifolia). On average, these species grew more than 1.5 m in three years, with 5% of their individuals growing more than 4 m. The six slowest-growing species included four late-successional species (C. racemiflora, P. acuminate var. montana, M. deflexa, and Mora abbottii) and two early-successional species (Tabebuia bullata and O. leucoxylon). On average, these species grew between 28 and 67 cm in height over three years, with only 0.4% of their individuals growing more than 2 m in three years.

It was expected that M. coriacea and B. comocladifolia would probably have the highest growth rates and survivorship because they are the dominant tree species in the thickets (Slocum et al. 2004). However, once the fern was eliminated, these species did not perform better than species that were rare or that did not occur in the thickets at all. Indeed, the species with the best combination of growth and survivorship included one that was moderately common in the thickets (Alchornea latifolia) and one that did not occur in the thickets (Inga fagifolia). The latter, a late-successional nitrogen-fixer, achieved a mean height increment of 159 cm and had almost no mortality over three years. In the same time period, A. latifolia, an early-successional species, grew an average of 207 cm in height and had only 4% mortality. 

As mentioned above, this project of sown seedlings was conducted concurrently with a study of natural regeneration in the clearings (Slocum et al. 2004). Natural regeneration was substantial after clearing the thickets, with many individuals growing more than 2 m in height from seed in 3 years. Moreover, three years after clearing, regrowth of D. pectinata reached only 16% cover, and most of this regrowth could be easily controlled because it stemmed from thickets along clearing edges. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The fertilizer treatment (poultry litter) increased height increment of only one species, B. comocladifolia, and the survivorship of another, Piper aduncum. This result may be explained by the use of only a small amount of the poultry litter (a single application of approximately 100 mL), which was decided upon when preliminary experiments (M. G. Slocum, Louisiana State University; T. M. Aide, University of Puerto Rico; J. K. Zimmerman, University of Puerto Rico; and L. Navarro, Universidad de Vigo, Spain, unpublished data) showed that some species exhibited high mortality when fertilization with poultry litter was repeated. A limited response to fertilization may also be explained by the fact that the poultry litter had concentrations of N (1.8%) and P (1.4%) lower than the average found in poultry litter in the U.S.A. (4.9% N and 2.1% P) (Sharpley et al. 1998). Percent K of the litter (2.1%) was the same as the U.S. mean. Alternatively, Davidson et al. (1998) suggest that nutrients released by fertilizer might have been absorbed by the soil and might, thus, have become unavailable for uptake by plants. Two other studies conducted on acidic, highly weathered tropical soils found a similar lack of response of woody plants to fertilizer (Harcombe 1977; Davidson et al. 1998).
Although Dicranopteris pectinata has inhibited natural succession at the EVSR for more than 20 years, this study has demonstrated that by simply clearing large plots and planting a mixture of native woody species, one can successfully initiate forest restoration. The soils of the site were apparently sufficiently fertile to support the growth of sown woody plants and also to foster natural regeneration. In fact, the concurrent study of natural regeneration at the site showed that after clearing the fern thickets, natural forest succession alone could be a cost-effective way to restore forests in the EVSR. However, the process was found to be patchy and species-poor, as only 23 species became established, and only 12 exhibited good growth rates (Slocum et al. 2004). This lack of species diversity might be overcome with time, as the development of secondary forest begins attracting seed-dispersing animals (Holl et al. 2000), but the process is slow and could allow the reestablishment of ferns or other competitors. Therefore, the planting of woody species is recommended as a means of complimenting natural regeneration by increasing overall species diversity and filling areas where vegetative succession is limited.
By using a large number of native species that varied in life history characteristics, this study enabled practitioners to identify promising species for future reforestation efforts. Based on the initial assessment of species used in this study, researchers recommend that open areas be planted with I. fagifolia and A. latifolia in order to shade out competitors and perhaps improve soils. Given their high survivorship, these species could be planted using a wider separation (every 3 – 4 m) than that employed in this study (1-m spacing). Once they have created a closed canopy, the planting of late-successional canopy and understory species (Ashton et al. 2001), such as Cyrilla racemiflora, Prestoea acuminata var. montana, Myrcia deflexa, and Mora abbottii, could help increase site diversity. These treatments are relatively inexpensive and could easily be tested in other montane ecosystems where D. pectinata covers thousands of hectares. "

Restingas, or sandy coastal plains, are one such ecosystem that has been greatly impacted by encroaching human populations, and this study was undertaken to restore natural vegetation on a remnant restinga in Rio de Janeiro. Although shrubs and trees comprise the majority of a natural restinga plant community, exotic grasses had predominated on the study site and drastically reduced species richness. The project, therefore, began with the removal of grass cover and then proceeded with the introduction of 17 nursery-reared native shrub and tree species that were monitored for growth and survival over a period of 2 years. In spite of the adverse growing conditions typically presented by the nutrient-poor sandy soils characteristic of restingas, 70% of the introduced species showed high rates of survival and considerable growth at the end of the monitoring period. Results of the study suggest that the plantation of nursery-reared native species is a viable option for restoring natural vegetation and ecosystem function to these degraded restingas.Deforestation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Restingas of the Brazilian littoral have been affected by human impacts for about 8,000 years (Kneip 1987). Human occupation has recently increased to such an extent that there is a need for conservation of remnant patches and restoration of degraded areas. Restinga vegetation has suffered considerable habitat destruction because most Brazilian big cities are situated on the coast. However, these systems are often not treated as a conservation priority because they have few endemic species (Barbosa et al. 2004).
The city of Rio de Janeiro once had a vegetation complex consisting of Atlantic forest, mangroves, and restingas. The restinga vegetation covered an extensive area on the west side of the city; however, only 0.63% (770.65 ha) of the total area of the municipality is still occupied by this vegetation type, which represents a loss of 30% of the restinga cover in the period from 1984 to 1999 (PCRJ 2000a). Despite this massive reduction in area, the restingas of Rio de Janeiro provide important habitat for endemic species of plants, insects, fish, and lizards, which are threatened with extinction (Vanzolini & Ab’Saber 1968; Araujo & Maciel 1998; PCRJ 2000b).
The restinga targeted for restoration under the project had been subjected to deforestation and fire in the past in order to clear the area for a housing project. Invasive plants occupied the area before the onset of the experiment, such as the exotic grasses Panicum maximum Jacq., Imperata brasiliensis Trin., and Melinis minutiflora P. Beauv, which are locally common throughout urban areas, and the exotic tree Casuarina equisetifolia L. (Casuarinaceae), which is frequently planted in coastal zones in Brazil as a wind shield. Restinga is both a geomorphological and a botanical term. It applies equally to the sandy plains dating from the Quaternary, mostly from the Holocene, and to the vegetation covering these plains. Restingas differ from dunes in that they are sand marine deposits, whereas dunes are wind deposits. The restinga vegetation is a mosaic of plant communities ranging from creeping types to open scrubs and even forests (Lacerda et al. 1993; Martin et al. 1993).
Most plants and animals inhabiting the restingas of Rio de Janeiro originated in the neighboring Atlantic rainforest and successfully migrated and colonized the geologically younger sandy plains (Rizzini 1979; Araujo 2000). The restinga ecosystem is therefore unique because it comprises a pool of species with high ecological plasticity, since, despite their rainforest origin, they colonized, survive and grow in the dry, resource-poor restingas. This characteristic may be of key relevance in a global change scenario (Scarano 2002).
Restinga vegetation is often species-rich, although plants are subjected to the various constraints imposed by drought, nutrient-poor sandy substrate, wind, salinity, and high soil and air temperatures (Reinert et al. 1997). Paradoxically, it has been shown that few restinga plants are capable of establishing via seeds on bare sand and, therefore, the structure and function of open restinga vegetation relies on a few pioneer nurse-plants that facilitate the entry and establishment of a number of other species (Scarano 2002; Dias et al. 2005).
Remnants of the native vegetation at the project site–such as Cupania emarginata Cambess. (Sapindaceae), Eugenia ovalifolia Cambess. (Myrtaceae), E. rotundifolia Casar. (Myrtaceae), Inga maritima Benth. (Leguminosae – Mimosoideae), Myrciaria floribunda (H. West ex Willd.) Legrand (Myrtaceae), and Ocotea sp. (Lauraceae)–provide a strong indication that the original plant community prior to disturbance was that described as a “˜”˜Myrtaceae thicket” (Lacerda et al. 1993). To provide information on the best choices of trees and shrubs for restoring this and other restinga areas in the region.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: At the outset of the project, individuals of C. equisetifolia were removed with a chainsaw, and invasive grasses were mechanically removed and buried circa 20 cm deep in the soil. The planting holes had dimensions of 30 x 30 x 30 cm and were separated from each other by 2.5 m along a given line; and lines were separated from each other also by 2.5 m. Between lines, holes were dug at a distance of 5 m from each other and at a distance of 1.25 m from the lines. Although native vegetation in such sites is a closed thicket, a uniform, spaced plant distribution pattern was chosen in an attempt to reduce the effect of competition between neighbors. The planting holes each received 20 L of an organic compound produced from urban garbage.

Species were chosen based on two criteria: first, the occurrence of the species in the Myrtaceae thicket of the restingas on the west side of Rio de Janeiro (Araujo & Henriques 1984) and second, the seedling availability. Seventeen species of trees and shrubs were chosen belonging to 10 botanical families""”Anacardiaceae: Tapirira guianensis Aubl.; Bignoniaceae: Tabebuia chrysotricha (Mart. ex DC.) Standl.; Bombacaceae: Pseudobombax grandiflorum (Cav.) A. Robyns; Erythroxylaceae: Erythroxylum ovalifolium Peyr.; Euphorbiaceae: Pera glabrata Baill.; Leguminosae - Caesalpinioideae: Chamaecrista ensiformis (Vell.) H.S. Irwin & Barneby, Senna australis (Vell.) H.S. Irwin & Barneby, and S. pendula (Humb. & Bonpl. ex Willd.) H.S. Irwin & Barneby; Myrtaceae: Eugenia ovalifolia Cambess., E. rotundifolia Casar., E. sulcata Spring. ex Mart., E. uniflora L., and Myrcia cf. multiflora (Lam.) DC.; Ochnaceae: Ouratea cuspidata (A. St.-Hil.) Engl.; Rubiaceae: Tocoyena bullata Mart.; and Sapindaceae: Allophylus puberulus Radlk. and Cupania emarginata Cambess.

During the rainy season between 23 and 30 March 1998, 4,700 seedlings belonging to the 17 chosen species were planted on the site. Once planted, seedlings were individually tied to bamboo sticks to protect them from wind damage and facilitate visibility, so as to avoid damage during maintenance activities. During the first 30 days after planting, seedlings were irrigated to field capacity on all days when no rain occurred. Invasive grasses were removed with a backpack brushcutter six times from March 1998 to June 1999. Logistics did not allow further control of invasive grasses. Surviving plants were counted 130 days after planting. Survival counts were undertaken at this stage to assess if the replacement of seedlings was necessary.

To allow acclimation, monitoring was started 90 days after planting. A total of 337 plants were monitored: 20 individuals of each species, which were selected randomly and labeled with numbered aluminum tags, except for P. glabrata, which had only 17 surviving individuals. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Low mortality was observed after planting, confirming initial expectations. Only 5.2% of the 4,700 plants introduced had died 130 days after planting. Thus, no replacement of monitored plants was necessary. After 2 years, at the final monitoring, a survival rate of 81.9% was recorded for the 337 plants monitored, and 12 of the 17 species studied had survival rates higher than 80%. Almost 50% of the species introduced had 100% survival at the end of the experiment.

Nine out of 17 species had some mortality during the 2 years of monitoring. Only one individual of each of Chamaecrista ensiformis, Tabebuia chrysotricha, and Tapirira guianensis died, and in all cases, death occurred in the summer, between October 1998 and February 1999. Erythroxylum ovalifolium's mortality was concentrated between June 1998 and February 1999. Mortality also occurred under the high summer temperatures for Eugenia ovalifolia and E. rotundifolia, always between October 1998 and April 1999, except for one E. ovalifolia plant that died during the following summer. Senna pendula showed a distinct pattern: mortality was zero until April 1999, but from then on, 40% of the plants died, and the remaining plants showed signs of senescence at the end of the experiment. High mortality was also found for E. sulcata, which showed a steady increase in the number of dead individuals from June 1998 to October 1998 (50%); and by the end of the experiment in March 2000, this species showed 65% mortality. Similarly, Myrcia cf. multiflora had 65% mortality by March 2000, with mortality always being higher during the summer periods.

Nine of the 17 species studied (Allophylus puberulus, C. ensiformis, E. ovalifolium, E. ovalifolia, E. sulcata, E. uniflora, M. cf. multiflora, S. pendula, and T. chrysotricha) showed no significant increase in height. Individual negative height increments were common. No data were collected on wind, but wind is believed to be partly responsible for this pattern because shoots of many seedlings were broken, even though plants were tied to bamboo sticks. Height increase was largest for Pseudobombax grandiflorum, Cupania emarginata, S. australis, and Tocoyena bullata. Averaging the values of increment in height of the eight species that showed statistically significant positive values (C. emarginata, E. rotundifolia, Ouratea cuspidata, Pera glabrata, P. grandiflorum, S. australis, T. guianensis, and T. bullata) resulted in a mean annual relative growth rate (RGR) for height of 11.32 cm/yr. 

All species monitored showed a significant increase in basal diameter, except for M. cf. multiflora. Again, P. grandiflorum showed the highest increment in basal diameter, along with T. guianensis. 

Canopy area growth was highest for S. australis and lowest for C. emarginata. The latter, along with M. cf. multiflora, E. sulcata, and S. pendula, showed no significant increase in canopy area. Decreases in canopy area were usually due to temporary deciduousness or breaking of branches. 

Senna australis showed the best growth performance overall. The species canopy area growth was the highest, increasing on average 1.6 times per month. Pseudobombax grandiflorum had the second best performance due to high height and basal diameter increment, whereas M. cf. multiflora and E. sulcata had the worst performance. They had no significant growth in any of the parameters analyzed over the 2 years of the experiment. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Overall growth rates at the site were low, as indicated by the values obtained for RGR for height (11.32 cm/yr) of the eight species that showed significant positive growth values. Slow growth rates are most likely related to nutrient-poor soils, high light intensities, and the wind action common to all restingas (Araujo & Oliveira 1988; Scarano et al. 2001).

It is likely that introduction of larger seedlings, the use of more fertilizers, and more frequent removal of invasive grasses would improve overall survival and growth, but under the conditions of the present experiment, the performances of the Myrtaceae Eugenia rotundifolia, E. ovalifolia, E. sulcata, and particularly of Myrcia cf. multiflora would not recommend their use for restoration projects. This was unexpected given that the natural vegetation that used to occupy the study site prior to damage is named Myrtaceae thicket. This low performance deserves further investigation, but it could be related to age and size of seedlings and initial planting season.
Senna australis, P. grandiflorum, C. ensiformis, and T. guianensis showed the best results, and their use is recommended in open restinga areas subjected to wind and high temperatures. Eugenia uniflora and T. bullata, C. emarginata, O. cuspidata, and P. glabrata showed excellent survival and an intermediate reasonable growth, as did E. ovalifolium, which had a 15% mortality rate, however. Allophylus puberulus and T. chrysotricha had reduced growth but high survival, and could also be used with relative success in restoration initiatives in similar restingas. The Myrtaceae, E. rotundifolia, E. ovalifolia, and E. sulcata, and particularly M. cf. multiflora, had a very poor overall performance.
Senna australis showed the highest UVI of the species studied. The rapid soil cover by the canopy of this species indicates that it might be useful to avoid or reduce grass invasion because grass invaders in the restingas, such as the ones removed prior to the start of the experiment, are typical sun plants. Moreover, it is likely that this species also plays an important role in nutrient cycling, due to an apparently high leaf turnover that results in a thick layer of dry leaves in its understory. However, the use of S. australis in restoration programs requires caution because this plant shows a profuse branch formation close to the soil level, which may mechanically hinder seedling establishment under and around its canopy. Pseudobombax grandiflorum had the second best performance, despite its small canopy cover and deciduousness, which are the disadvantages to take into consideration in areas where invasive grasses are present. In such cases, it would appear that the best use of this species would be in association with a species with higher potential for canopy cover.
Although only a small sample of the broad range of restinga species were assessed in this study, the results obtained provide an optimistic perspective for the possibility of successful restinga restoration, particularly from a biodiversity viewpoint. This example of the successful introduction of native woody plants in Brazilian restingas suggests that this type of approach may restore both biodiversity and ecosystem processes in tropical coastal habitats of Brazil and elsewhere. This may, in turn, prove useful for carbon sequestration as well.
Studies on plant colonization and succession in natural restinga areas have often suggested that restingas are a fragile habitat, where plant germination and establishment depend on specific nurse plants, such as bromeliad and Clusia sp. (see Scarano 2002, for review). This project shows that restoration practitioners can play ex situ the role played in situ by the nurse-plants–that is, grow restinga plants in nurseries until they can be safely transferred to the field (Eliason & Allen 1997). Future experiments using introduction of nurse-plants should cast further light on the adequacy of restoration strategies for the restingas. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/mexico-forestacion-con-mangles-en-isletas-de-dragados-en-la-costa-semiarida-de-sinaloa/	México: Forestación con Mangles en Isletas de Dragados en la Costa Semiárida de Sinaloa	Mexico	2003-09-14	2008-09-14	"La bahía de Navachiste, localizada al norte del Estado de Sinaloa, se considera como sitio RAMSAR de importancia para aves acuáticas migratorias y es un área de importancia pesquera. Sin embargo, actividades como la agricultura, la acuacultura y las descargas de aguas urbanas han ocasionado la contaminación del cuerpo de agua, por lo que se desarrolló un programa de dragado para la rehabilitación hidrológica del sistema lagunar. Como parte del programa, se condicionó a que las zonas de depósito formaran tarquinas como isletas y fueran forestadas con manglares para su estabilización, como hábitat de apoyo a pesquerías, refugio de aves acuáticas y como biofiltros. Por tales razones, el presente estudio planteó como objetivo principal determinar las condiciones más adecuadas para la formación artificial de nuevas áreas de manglares en isletas de dragado con las especies Rhizophora mangle y Avicennia germinans, con el fin de propiciar su establecimiento. En este trabajo se utilizaron tres formas de propagación para la forestación: plantas de vivero con y sin contenedor e individuos extraídos de su medio natural. La forestación se realizó en diferentes áreas de una isleta de acuerdo al hidroperiodo requerido por cada especie (zonación), salinidad intersticial y otros factores y se instaló en dos fases: la primera con plantas de 5 meses de edad y la segunda con plantas de 10 meses. Los resultados indican que las plantas de 10 meses de A. germinans ofrecen mejor alternativa para la forestación de isletas y que los mejores sitios para la forestación se encuentran en una franja más angosta comparada con la zona que ocupan los manglares en su estado natural como consecuencia de la elevada salinidad intersticial. Se mostró que la microtopografía, la salinidad intersticial y el hidroperiodo son los factores más importantes a tomarse en cuenta al momento de la forestación de isletas de dragados.Fisheries & Aquaculture, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry La construcción de granjas camaroneras ha tenido un impacto importante en la destrucción de manglar. De manera global son las responsables de la desaparición del 10 al 15% de esta vegetación y en la actualidad en las zonas donde se sigue desarrollando, son responsables de la destrucción del 20 al 50% de los manglares (NACA, 1994). En Sinaloa se tienen consideradas 227 granjas de este tipo a lo largo de la zona constera. Adicionalmente se estima que existe un potencial de 200,000 ha más, para seguir desarrollando esta actividad (DUMAC, 2003). Es indudable que la camaronicultura ha provocado modificaciones al ambiente que van desde la calidad del agua hasta alteraciones tróficas, de hábitat, estructura de ecosistemas y comunidades (Ortega, 2002).
En particular sobre la problemática que ocasiona la acuacultura en la bahía de Navachiste, SEMARNAP (2000) señala que existen más de 25 granjas operando, que ocupan una superficie de 2,708 ha con un gasto de agua de 1,607,688 m3 al año, extraídos de la bahía y devueltos a la misma cargados de materia orgánica y sedimentos, causando serios problemas al manglar. A pesar de ello, se desconoce la superficie que ha desaparecido por año.
Además en la bahía de Navachiste, debido a presiones antropogénicas, se presenta un grado de deterioro evidente. Las causas principales son las descargas de los drenes de la actividad agrícola que se desarrolla en su planicie costera, principalmente la de Los Mochis (DUMAC, 2003), de las granjas acuícolas y de las aguas negras sin tratamiento de las ciudades de Los Mochis y Guasave, Sinaloa (SAGARPA-CONAPESCA, 2002). Esto está causando un serio problema de sedimentación producto de los arrastres de sedimentos de las tierras de las zonas agrícolas y tierras altas (751,433 ha de riego y 582,433 ha de temporal) (Gobierno del Estado de Sinaloa, 1990), conjuntamente con las descargas de agroquímicos. La elevada sedimentación ha modificado los patrones de inundaciones en las zonas intermareales, cambiando en muchos casos la vegetación prístina, debido a que la reducción del cuerpo de agua ha traído como consecuencia la desaparición de áreas de manglares (DUMAC, 2003). La bahía de Navachiste está compuesta de una serie de lagunas y esteros, los cuales albergan una gran diversidad biológica. Se considera como un sitio RAMSAR de importancia para aves acuáticas migratorias y es un área de importancia pesquera. De hecho, Vicencio (1979) encontró 16 familias y 30 especies de peces; no obstante, años después Díaz et al. (1999) determinaron 14 familias y 23 especies. GENERAL

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Se construyó un vivero de 50 m x 20 m (aprox 1,000 m2) en el campo pesquero El Caracol, municipio de Guasave. Las especies utilizadas fueron Rhizophora mangle (mangle rojo, candelón) y Avicennia germinans (mangle negro, puyeque, madresal, cenizo), por considerarse las más adaptadas para los niveles de salinidad que se presentan en esta región. De julio a septiembre de 2003 se produjeron 18,000 plantas y en la temporada 2004 otras 7,000; de las cuales se emplearon aprox el 80% para la forestación de las isletas. Para el crecimiento de las ""semillas"" se utilizaron contenedores de polietileno negro de 18 cm de diámetro por 26 cm de altura, llenados con un sustrato compuesto por 20% de arena y 80% de tierra (aluvión), ambos de río.

Se realizaron salidas de campo a los manglares de la bahía de Navachiste para llevar a cabo la recolección y preselección de ""semillas"" o hipocótilos a utilizar en la producción de plántulas, buscando que dichas semillas pertenecieran a poblaciones representativas de manglares sanas y homogéneas.

Para la producción de plántulas de Avicennia germinans se llevó a cabo la recolección de 10,000 ""semillas"" el 5 de septiembre de 2003. Se colectaron aquellas que presentaban una coloración amarillo oro, propio de las propágulos con madurez fisiológica adecuada y con apariencia sana. Estas fueron sembradas previo proceso de escarificación sumergiéndolas en agua dulce durante 24 horas. Se depositaron en charolas agrícolas llenadas con un sustrato inerte (turba o estopa de coco molida), propio para germinar hortalizas. Un mes después las plántulas (6 de octubre de 2003), fueron plantadas en los contenedores para su crecimiento.

La producción de plántulas de Rhizophora mangle, se hizo a través de hipocótilos cuyo tamaño variaba de 15 a 25 cm y que presentaban la parte apical de color café marrón. Estos fueron sembrados directamente en los contenedores de vivero a una profundidad de aproximadamente 4 a 7 cm, lo cual se llevó a cabo el 16 de agosto de 2003.

Otra fuente de propagación que se utilizó para los experimentos fueron plántulas extraídas de su ambiente natural aproximadamente de 5 y 10 meses de edad y plantadas inmediatamente en el lugar del experimento (isleta). Las plántulas utilizadas fueron seleccionadas al azar, aquellas que presentaban de 2 a 3 entrenudos, cuya altura en promedio alcanzaba 15.1 cm para R. mangle y 18.5 cm para A. germinans. Se extraían con palas jardineras chicas, procurando lastimar lo menos posibles sus raíces y un bolo o cepellón de aproximadamente 7 cm de diámetro por 10 a 15 de longitud.

La construcción y el diseño técnico de las isletas, así como el cálculo de resistencia de los materiales estuvieron a cargo de la CONAPESCA, basándose en estudios de batimetría, corrientes, energía de las olas, zonas de sedimentación y áreas colindantes de manglares.

Se construyeron cuatro isletas, pero solo una fue seleccionada para llevar a cabo el presente estudio por ser la más grande y protegida. La isleta donde se realizó el experimento tiene forma rectangular, mide 540 m de largo por 200 m de ancho; una superficie de aproximadamente 11 ha y una altura aproximada de 3 m con respecto al nivel bajo de las mareas.

Se seleccionaron sitios cuya frecuencia de inundación de la marea fuera por lo menos de 15 inundaciones por mes, que no presentara inundaciones que duraran más de un mes, ya que la salinidad de un lugar también depende de la penetración de las mareas, es decir, de su amplitud y la topografía local. Para conocer esta situación se utilizaron los calendarios de mareas regionales y la experiencia local de los pescadores, así como la topografía y zonación de los manglares ya existentes. También se buscó que el lugar estuviera lo menos expuesto a la acción permanente de olas porque induce a la erosión (parte protegida de la isleta).

Para dar inicio al proceso de forestación, fue necesario esperar un tiempo razonable para que hubiera cierta estabilización y maduración del suelo, en esta ocasión fueron alrededor de 9 meses dado que eran espacios nuevos formados por el vertimiento o depósitos de lodos.

En algunos de los sitios elegidos se implementaron pequeños cercos o ""tapos"" de malla-sombra con el fin de disminuir el efecto de la energía de las mareas y el oleaje, que cubrieron básicamente a los ensayos experimentales, además sirvieron como trampas para ""semillas."" Para su colocación se consideró la topografía del terreno, lo que estuvo en función de la influencia de las mareas y las especies utilizadas en la forestación, es decir, se tomó como referencia la altura promedio del nivel donde se encuentren establecidas las poblaciones de manglar para simular y conservar el patrón de distribución normal como se encuentran en su estado natural.

Es importante señalar que para dar inicio al proceso de forestación en las isletas, inicialmente se realizaron ensayos preliminares. En junio de 2003 se llevó a cabo la instalación de los tubos de PVC acorde con la técnica de Riley (1999), es decir en la zona que corresponde a la ubicación natural del manglar. Se colocaron 50 tubos de 4"" de diámetro y 75 cm de longitud y 50 de 2"" de diámetro de la misma longitud. Se enterraron aproximadamente a 35 cm; se llenaron de sustrato para alcanzar con exactitud la zonación o nivel de marea de R. mangle. Al mes de haberse instalado se procedió a la siembra de propágulos de R. mangle. 

Otro de los ensayos preliminares consistió en la construcción de corrales a base de madera y malla-sombra agrícola con el propósito de generar espacios que funcionaran como ""trampas"" semilleras o bien mantuvieran las semillas que se depositaban dentro de las mismas. Estas trampas se colocaron en las áreas donde corresponde a la zonación natural de A. germinans y R. mangle en forma paralela y perpendicular al oleaje, tratando de que fueran más altas que las mareas y que de esta forma las ""semillas"" de mangle se mantuvieran hasta que éstas se pudieran fijar, o bien a que se enraizaran al suelo de manera natural.

El experimento se estableció en agosto de 2004 con plantas de vivero de aproximadamente 5 y 10 meses de edad y plantas extraídas de su medio natural con aproximadamente la misma edad que las plantas de vivero, éstos se conocen a través del número de entrenudos que presentan las plantas en el campo. La forestación se llevó a cabo durante el inicio del periodo regional de lluvias (agosto), por considerarse la mejor época del año para la plantación de especies arbóreas en general, ya que se aprovechan las lluvias como riego natural. En este caso en particular la influencia de las lluvias disminuye la salinidad y además, aumenta considerablemente el aporte de nutrientes.

Por el caso de plantas producidas en vivero se recomienda una densidad de 2,000 a 3,000 por ha. En este trabajo se utilizó una densidad aproximada de 4,500 con una distancia entre planta y planta de 1.5 m x 1.5 m con el fin de igualar la densidad mínima que presenta el manglar de la bahía de Navachiste que va de 4,590 a 8,784 fustes por ha (Monzalvo-Santos, 2006).

Las parcelas experimentales y/o tratamientos constaron de 50 plantas de vivero con 5 meses de edad, plantadas incluyendo el contenedor y 50 plantadas de vivero con 5 meses de edad sin incluir el contenedor y 50 plantas extraídas de su medio natural. Tratamientos que contenían 50 plantas de 10 meses de edad plantadas incluyendo el contenedor y 50 plantadas con 10 meses de edad sin incluir el contenedor y 50 plantas extraídas de su medio natural con dos repeticiones, utilizando R. mangle y A. germinans. Las plantas se depositaron en pozos de 20 cm de diámetro por 30 a 40 cm de profundidad, dependiendo del tamaño del contenedor. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: ENSAYOS PRELIMINARES
Con respecto a la técnica de Riley (1999), muchos de los tubos fueron arrastrados por el fuerte oleaje que ocurre con frecuencia en la bahía de Navachiste y sólo quedó aproximadamente el 50%, de este porcentaje al 30% les fue eliminado el sustrato por el mismo problema y en cuanto a propágulos prendidos apenas se logró el 1% (4 plantas). 

En agosto de 2003 se realizó la siembra directa de 3,000 hipocótilos de R. mangle. Se enterraron entre 5 y 7 cm de profundidad a una distancia de 0.5 m entre hileras, de los cuales sólo lograron sobrevivir aproximadamente 1% (30 plantas). El 99% perecieron por desecamiento, herbivoría y por efecto causado por las corrientes de marea que ocurren en la bahía. 

Las trampas semilleras fueron arrancadas y enterradas por el fuerte oleaje en la mayoría de los casos. En las dos trampas que no fueron destruidas ""nacieron"" o prendieron solamente el 1.5% de las 700 ""semillas"" que se depositaron en ellas. También se plantaron individuos producidos en vivero con el propósito de probar la eficiencia como protección. Las plantas incluidas en dichas trampas presentaron un crecimiento del 15% más que las plantas no protegidas.

ENSAYO EXPERIMENTAL
--Supervivencia--
Entre las plantas sembradas a los 5 meses de edad, A. germinans de vivero con contenedor (Agvcb) presentó la mayor supervivencia al mantener 33 de las 50 plantas sembradas inicialmente (66%). Seguida de A. germinans de vivero sin contenedor (Agvsb) que lograron sobrevivir 29.5, lo que significa un 59%. De A. germinans extraída de su medio natural (Agmn) solo sobrevivió el 17% y de R. mangle extraído de su medio natural (Rmmn), que fue la que presentó el menor número de plantas vivas al final del estudio, solo sobrevivieron 3 de las 50 que se plantaron (6%).

Entre las plantas sembradas a los 10 meses de edad, la mayor supervivencia promedio bimensual fue para Agvsb al mantener 38 de las 50 plantas (76%) empleadas por tratamiento. Seguida de Agvcb que lograron sobrevivir 36 (72%). Sin embargo, de Agmn solo sobrevivieron el 34%. Por el contrario el tratamiento de Rmmn fue el que presentó el menor número de plantas vivas, solamente sobrevivieron 10 de las 50 que se plantaron (21%).

--Crecimiento--
De acuerdo con los resultados la tasa de crecimiento para las plantas sembradas a los 5 meses de edad presentó diferencia significativa entre las especies utilizadas. A. germinans obtuvo mayor crecimiento con respecto a R. mangle. En relación con las formas de propagación, Agvcb presentó diferencia significativa respecto a Agvsb y Agmn y el mayor crecimiento fue el nivel topográfico uno (parte menos inundada). Sin embargo, para Agmn existió diferencia signficativa respecto a Agvcb y Agvsb siendo éstas 1.5 veces mayor en el nivel 2 (área más inundada).

El tamaño inicial para estas dos formas de propagación era significativamente diferente al momento de su plantación a pesar de contar con la misma edad. Para Agvcb y Agvsb fue de aprox 12.5 cm en cambio para Agmn fue de 9 cm, se debió probablemente a las condiciones de hipersalinidad presentes en el medio natural, en comparación con las que se dieron artificialmente en el vivero. Adicionalmente al escaso crecimiento en su medio natural las plantas extraídas del medio natural presentaron una menor supervivencia (27%) que las provenientes del vivero (67%).

Las plantas de Rmvsb presentaron mayor crecimiento en el nivel topográfico dos (área más inundada) en comparación con el nivel uno, resultando 1.21 veces mayor Rmvsb que las Rmvcb. Lo más importante de estos resultados fue que las plantas de R. mangle el mayor crecimiento lo alcanzaron en la zona de mayor inundación (Nivel 2) mientras que A. germinans fue en el nivel de menor inundación (Nivel 1), esto de acuerdo con la zonación de la región, la cual depende principalmente de la marea y la microtopografía.

En las plantas sembradas a los 10 meses de edad el crecimiento también fue significativo, A. germinans fue mayor que R. mangle. Aunque se mayor tasa de crecimiento lo alcanzaron en el nivel topográfico dos. Probablemente se debió a la mayor supervivencia que se expresó en la franja media del área experimental, es decir entre los dos niveles topográficos.

R. mangle solo presentó diferencia significativa entre los niveles topográficos, alcanzando de nuevo su mayor altura en el nivel topográfico dos.

De manera general, la tasa de crecimiento fue significativamente diferente entre A. germinans respecto a R. mangle para ambas edades de plantas con salinidades que fluctuó entre 45 ups en promedio durante el año de estudio. La diferencia de crecimiento mensual de la región de estudio con otros sitios probablemente obedezca principalmente a la diferencia en las condiciones ambientales (humedad relativa, disponibilidad de nutrientes, etc.) pero, sobre todo lo que tiene que ver con la lluvia. En la región de la bahía de Navachiste llueve aprox de 365 y 450 mm en promedio anual, en cambio los niveles de evaporación son aprox de 2,000 mm promedio anual induciendo a la formación de suelos hipersalinos (SEMARNAP, 2000). Estas condiciones climáticas propician limitaciones en la tasa de crecimiento, prueba de ello son el matorral de mangles que predominan en dicha región. Lo contrario ocurre en aquellas zonas tropicales donde la precipitación es más abundante, los bosques de mangles se desarrollan con mayor vigor (Winograd, 1987).

--Diámetro--
Las plantas sembradas de 5 meses de edad fueron significativamente diferente entre A. germinans respecto a R. mangle. A. germinans fue la que mayor diámetro (5.72 mm) para plantas de Agvcb en el nivel topográfico uno y R. mangle logró 4.6 mm en promedio en el nivel topográfico dos. Resultados similares ocurrieron en las plantas de 10 meses de edad, debido a que Agvcb logró un mayor diámetro (6.9 mm) y R. mangle 4.7 mm para plantas del tratamiento Rmvsb. Es importante señalar que el crecimiento en diámetro está relacionado directamente con la altura y, según los resultados las plantas de vivero de A. germinans de 10 meses de edad fueron las que mayor diámetro alcanzaron por lo que esta especie representa la mejor opción para la forestación de isletas bajo condiciones ambientales propias de la región de la bahía de Navachiste.

--Fertilidad del Sustrato--
De acuerdo a los resultados la fertilidad del sustrato, es decir aquellas sales que si están disponibles como nutrientes para las plantas, se observó que en los sustratos de las tarquinas inicialmente algunos nutrientes presentaron excesos, por ejemplo el Ca2+, K+ y el Mg2+ y al final del estudio estos disminuyeron. En otros casos sucedió lo contrario, es decir inicialmente presentaron valores bajos como el caso de los N-NO3 y al final del estudio valores altos, pero, de manera general con una tendencia a igualarse a lo encontrado en los bosques monoespecíficos de A. germinans y R. mangle que se consideraron como testigos. Para el caso del K+ cuyos valores son altos en los testigos comparado con el encontrado en la isleta, es debido posiblemente a la retención del sustrato durante el tiempo que tiene establecido el bosque de manglar. Otro factor importante se refiere a la presencia de Materia Orgánica (MO) que se fue acumulando en el tiempo con una tendencia a igualar a los testigos. La MO contribuye en la Capacidad de Intercambio Catiónico (CIC) a pesar de que es un suelo franco arenoso, esto coadyuva a facilitar la disponibilidad de los elementos nutritivos. Lo cual se pudo observar al final del experimento donde se pudo notar en las plantas un crecimiento más rápido.

Muchos de los cambios que se dieron en la isleta durante el estudio pudieron deberse al proceso natural de oxido-reducción que está ocurriendo en la tarquina y las constantes aportaciones de nutrientes por el agua de la bahía. Asimismo la capacidad que tiene el sustrato como compuesto ""buffer"" para ir soportando estos cambios paulatinos hasta igualar las características del sustrato con el resto de la bahía. 

Otro factor que favorece o perjudica a la fertilidad del sustrato de las tarquinas, es la textura que presentó característica de un suelo arenoso, al encontrar el 62% al principio y 57% al final del experimento. Tanto los excesos de sales como la presencia de estas cantidades de arena en los suelos permite la floculación y por ende la estructura o terrones. Lo que repercute en suelos pobres desde el punto de vista de la fertilidad, sobre todo nitratos que tiende a perderse por lixiviación por su alta movilidad.

Existen contenidos de limo y arcilla que son partículas con gran actividad química sobre todo con una capacidad de retener elementos como Na+, K+, Ca2+ y Mg2+ lo que provoca una acumulación de estos en el tiempo (Marschner, 1986), como se muestra en las concentraciones de salinidad y los contenidos intercambiables de estos elementos. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Según los resultados de este estudio, los parámetros que fueron importantes para la supervivencia de las plantas de ambas especies fueron la salinidad y la microtopografía. Debido a que la superficie de la zona experimental presentaba pequeños promontorios y bajos, se observaba mucha variación en la salinidad. En las partes altas se encontraron salinidades que alcanzaron las 155 ups y a medida que bajaba la pendiente los resultados se asemejan a la salinidad del agua superficial que presentó entre 33 y 45 ups durante la época de muestreo.

Debido a que los manglares son halófitas facultativas pueden sobrevivir en diferentes niveles de salinidad de 1 a 70 ups; sin embargo, el crecimiento y desarrollo óptimo se observan en condiciones estuarinas con salinidades alrededor de 15 ups (Chapman, 1970). La presencia de manglares en buen estado de desarrollo obedece a la existencia de mezcla de agua dulce con marina con aportes de nutrientes terrígenos por el agua dulce y la eliminación de competidores por el agua salada (Chapman, 1970). Las condiciones por arriba de las 35 ups son consideradas hipersalinas por lo en las zonas extremadamente áridas no existen manglares (Araujo, 2000). Esto es evidente en la bahía de Navachiste por la elevada irradiación y el consecuente déficit hidrológico causado por la elevada evaporación (2100 mm anuales) y escasas lluvias (510 mm anuales). Se puede encontrar salinidades superiores a las 100 ups aunado a otros factores--como los fuertes vientos, corrientes de mareas y bajas temperaturas invernales.

Desde el punto de vista de la microtopografía se econtró que en los niveles topográficos utilizados (zonación) la salinidad intersticial varió de un promedio de 71 ups para el nivel uno, que era la parte menos inundable, a 52 ups para el nivel dos, que correspondía a la parte más inundable. Este comportamiento probablemente se deba al patrón de mortalidad y crecimiento de los mangles sembrados, presentándose en forma de pequeños manchones con mangles muertos ó con relativamente poco crecimiento como se observó en este estudio. Además, esto coadyuvó en la elevada mortalidad de las plantas al inicio del experimento, cuestión que es muy propia de las plantas cuando se transplantan en los sitios definitivos, fenómeno conocido como aclimatación. 

Son varios los factores involucrados en el desarrollo y distribución de los manglares, sin embargo, el hidroperiodo (debido principalmente a la intrusión de agua marina) es considerado un factor clave. Para efectos de reforestación o forestación, es necesario el conocimiento del efecto del hidroperiodo sobre la elevación topográfica, para determinar en que zona las plántulas tendrán más posibilidades de éxito (Mckee, 1995; Ellison & Farnsworth, 1997). Respecto a las especies estudiadas A. germinans fue significativamente diferente resultando mayor en sobrevivencia y crecimiento en relación con R. mangle en el nivel superior (Nivel 1) por ubicarse en una franja de inundación más apropiada para A. germinans, como lo demuestra la salinidad de acuerdo al gradiente topográfico. Probablemente se deba a que A. germinans es una especie excretora de sales por lo que es más tolerante a la salinidad, al contener mayor cantidad de sales en su xilema (López-Portillo, 2005), también A. germinans tolera una mayor presión osmótica y conductividad eléctrica de 8 a 14 dicisiemens del agua intersticial comparada con R. mangle que tolera 1 a 4 dicisiemens (López-Portillo & Escurra, 1988). Esto es congruente con la relación de la salinidad intersticial y la sobrevivencia y crecimiento de las plántulas de mangles.

Los resultados obtenidos indican que, además de los niveles topográficos existió diferencia significativa respecto a la edad de las plantas al momento de su siembra, en formas de propagación y entre especies. A. germinans logró una supervivencia del 66% para plantas sembradas a los 5 meses de edad y 76% para plantas sembradas a los 10 meses de edad, observándose que las plantas de vivero de A. germinans con contenedor y sin contenedor no presentaron diferencia significativa, pero presentaron una supervivencia mayor y significativa con respecto a las extraídas de su medio natural. En cambio R. mangle logró una supervivencia aprox del 33% para ambas edades de plantas y por lo tanto sin diferencia significativa. De acuerdo a los resultados de otros estudios, se pudiera pensar que A. germinans es más apta que R. mangle para la forestación de tarquinas en esta zona del país, donde la salinidad promedio es de aprox 36 ups durante todo el año. Esto reafirma porque en la zona de la bahía de Navachiste el 70% de la cubierta por manglar corresponde a A. germinans (DUMAC, 2003).

Se considera que otra de las razones que favorece a la mayor supervivencia de A. germinans se refiere a la arquitectura de sus raíces, de las cuales una parte se fija al sustrato y la otra presenta geotropismo negativo que utiliza para el intercambio gaseoso (neumatóforos) y, lo más importante aún, es que se manifiestan desde muy temprana edad (entre 4 y 5 meses). En R. mangle las raíces secundarias que ofrecen intercambios gaseosos y fijación en el sustrato (raíces adventicias) no se presentaron hasta aprox al año y medio. El periodo crítico para estabilizarse o aclimatarse a las condiciones de la isleta fueron aprox 4 meses después de haberse plantado para las dos especies y para las dos edades de plantas.

Otro factor que probablemente influyó en la supervivencia de las diferentes formas de propagación fue el tamaño del cepellón o bolo que contenían al momento de sembrarse. Las plantas de vivero contaban con un cepellón de 18 cm de longitud por 11.5 cm de diámetro y las extraídas de su medio natural aprox con 10 cm de longitud por 7 cm de diámetro. En éstas últimas quizá provocó que muchas de sus raíces fueran dañadas al momento de extraerse y por ende mayor estrés al momento de transporte y plantación. Es posible que también el efecto de la luz directa contribuyó a una mayor mortalidad, debido a que las plantas extraídas de su medio natural estaban bajo una parte del dosel del bosque natural. 

Los resultados de los análisis obtenidos evidenican que el sustrato de las isletas producto de dragado está sufriendo cambios, al encontrar que las características químicas tanto en los elementos intercambiables (fertilidad), así como las concentraciones de las sales solubles (salinidad), la conductividad eléctrica y la textura están evolucionando. Además, se sabe que las operaciones de dragado no son selectivas con respecto al tipo de sustrato que afectan. En las tarquinas en una etapa inicial es una mezcla no consolidada de limos-arcillas y arenas por lo que, éstas presentaron mucho dinamismo durante el periodo de estudio y se encuentran en un proceso de reconformación de los sedimentos tanto en la distribución granulométrica como en los procesos de compactación de sedimento.

En este mismo sentido se menciona que la disponibilidad de nutrientes en los suelos donde se establecen los manglares está relacionado con factores ambientales propios de este ecosistema, pero además, con las condiciones de las áreas adyacentes; y más aun en el caso de depósitos nuevos (tarquinas), donde destaca lo que se refiere al proceso de acumulación y disposición de nutrientes provocado por bacterias. Dichos procesos nunca serán los mismos si se comparan con bosques naturales, donde son mucho más eficientes (SjÁ¶ling et al., 2005). Otro parámetro importante a considerar es la salinidad y el hidroperiodo en las regiones marinas y zonas estuarinas, además, con los gradientes de salinidad que se forman (Medina et al., 1995) y sobre todo con el efecto de algunas sales tales como los silicatos y amonio (Arjonilla y Blasco, 2003) que cuando existe su acumulación son tóxicos para las plantas. Particularmente en las isletas se observó el caso de la alta concentración de cloruros, los cuales son tóxicos para las plantas. Muchos de los cambios antes mencionados quedan evidenciados con las diferentes concentraciones encontradas en suelos en otras regiones del mundo.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: La bahía de Navachiste alberga una gran diversidad biológica que incluye especies de interés comercial tales como camarón, lisa, tiburón, pargo, róbalo, jaiba, ostión, almeja voladora y otras (SAGARPA-CONAPESCA, 2002). Dicho eso, el proyecto de rehabilitación ecológica, empezado con el dragado de sedimentos y luego la forestación artificial de las isletas de dragado que se depositaron, beneficiará la economía sinaloense tanto como la economía nacional.
Los resultados indican que las plantas de 10 meses de A. germinans ofrecen mejor alternativa para forestación de isletas. A. germinans fue la especie que mayor supervivencia alcanzó con 66% y 76% y una tasa de crecimiento de 25.1 y 27 cm tanto a 5 como 10 meses de edad respectivamente. Las plantas de vivero fueron las mejores con una supervivencia promedio de 70% y un crecimiento de 1.62 cm/mes en comparación con las extraídas de su medio natural que lograron 36% supervivencia. Los mejores sitios para la forestación de isletas son los lugares protegidos y en una franja más angosta comparada con la zona que ocupan los manglares en su estado natural como consecuencia de la elevada salinidad intersticial (90 a 140 ups). La microtopografía, salinidad intersticial y el hidroperiodo son los factores más importantes a tomarse en cuenta al momento de la forestación de isletas de dragados. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/canada-restoration-of-a-fen-plant-community-after-peat-mining-in-southern-quebec/	Canada: Restoration of a Fen Plant Community after Peat Mining in Southern Québec	Canada	2001-04-08	2002-08-08	"Even several decades after the cessation of mining activities, natural revegetation of mined peat fields in North America is often constrained by a lack of suitable propagules, as the residual peat is devoid of plants and a viable seed bank (Salonen 1987), and natural areas surrounding the mined fields are typically bogs with few or no fen species present (Poulin et al. 1999; Campbell et al. 2003). This study was undertaken in the RiviÁ¨re-du-Loup peatland in southern Québec, Canada to test different restoration measures for their efficacy in contributing to the establishment of a fen plant community on minerotrophic surfaces after peat mining. Donor diaspore material, containing seeds, rhizomes, moss fragments and plant propagules, was collected from two nearby natural fens and tested as a possible means of facilitating revegetation. Also tested were the application of straw mulch as a means of increasing fen species cover and biodiversity compared to control plots, and terracing as a means of altering residual peat depths and thus influencing the process of revegetation. The results after two growing seasons showed the application of donor diaspore material to be an effective technique for establishing vascular fen plants, but they also suggested that rewetting measures are necessary in order to move beyond simply restoring fen species and begin creating a fen ecosystem.Mining & Resource Extraction Restoration work was carried out on two mined peat fields abandoned in September 2000. Following peat mining, the environmental conditions of an abandoned field are extremely harsh for plant re-establishment (Salonen 1987, 1992; Campbell et al. 2003). The physical properties of peat deteriorate due to the effects of long-term drainage and compression from peat mining operations (Okruszko 1995; Price et al. 2003). In addition, the microclimatic conditions are harsh due to an absence of vegetation cover, and the surface peat may form impenetrable crusts prone to frost heaving (Salonen 1987; Groeneveld & Rochefort 2002). The aim of this project was to restore a moderate-rich fen plant community on a minerotrophic peat surface degraded by mining activities.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: The restoration site included two adjacent fields (30 m Á— 60 m) separated by a central drainage ditch. Residual peat at the centre of the fields averaged 65 cm, and decreased towards the drainage ditches, where the residual peat averaged 20 cm. No vegetation was present on the fields, which were abandoned in September 2000. The peat was composed of matted sedges interspersed with coniferous wood. Preliminary chemical analyses indicated that the peat was characteristic of a fen. The underlying mineral soil was primarily clay with deposits of sand, gravel, and occasional boulders.

Field reconnaissance to locate donor sites revealed that there were few natural fens near the restoration site. However, two natural fens were found in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, ca. 25 km southwest of the restoration site. These fens were chosen as donor sites based on their proximity to the restoration site, accessibility, and contrasting plant communities and environmental site conditions.

The first donor site is a basin fen (National Wetlands Working Group, Anon. 1997) dominated by Sphagnum species (hereafter referred to as Sphagnum fen). It is a small fen (0.5 ha, 47Â°77' N, 52Â°83' W, ca. 274 m a.s.l.) receiving minerotrophic water from a small stream to the north and surface runoff from a slope on its western side. The donor area (25 m Á— 25 m) was positioned in the centre of the peatland where the peat depth averaged 86 cm. The site is characteristic of a poor fen based on the vegetation composition and water and peat chemistry (Zoltai & Vitt 1995). The main species (in order of dominance at the site, cover > 2%) are Sphagnum centrale, Sphagnum flexuosum, Utricularia minor, Polytrichum strictum, Calamagrostis canadensis, Salix pyrifolia, Picea mariana, Glyceria canadensis, Sphagnum capillifolium, Carex canescens, and Sphagnum magellanicum.

The second donor site is a riparian stream fen (Anon. 1997), dominated by Calamagrostis canadensis (hereafter referred to as Calamagrostis fen). It is a small fen (1.5 ha, 48Â°19' N, 52Â°81' W, ca. 320 m a.s.l.) receiving minerotrophic water from a stream entering the peatland on the north side, coursing through the main body of the fen and emptying into a small pond on the southern end. A beaver dam was found upstream of the fen in June 2001, which caused the water table to rise from below the surface to create flooded conditions for the remainder of the study period. The donor area (25 m Á— 25 m) was positioned in the centre of the fen where the peat depth averaged 85 cm. The fen is a moderate to rich fen (Zoltai & Vitt 1995). Other species that dominate (cover > 2%) the site are Warnstorfia exannulata, Carex utriculata, Scirpus cyperinus, Utricularia minor and Caltha palustris.

The experiment was a split-plot factorial design. In total, 54 plots (3 terrace levels Á— 3 blocks (replicates) Á— 3 vegetation treatments Á— 2 straw mulch treatments) were established. 

Terrace levels were treated as main plots and were divided into three blocks to minimize the effect of variance within the site. The vegetation and straw treatments were treated as subplots and were randomly assigned within the blocks.

The installation of the experiment commenced in April 2001, just after snow melt. The convex shape of the abandoned fields was modified to create three terraces of decreasing elevation, with different peat depths, on either side of and parallel to the main drainage ditch. The terraces were leveled with a machine grader that scraped excess peat off the site. The terrace levels are referred to as high, middle, and low, with an average peat depth of 56, 40 and 15 cm, respectively. The terrace levels could not be randomly positioned due to topographic constraints of the site. The central drainage canal was blocked, while a secondary ditch upslope of the site was unblocked. Peat mining operations continued on fields' upslope of the restoration site throughout the study period, and blocking of these drainage ditches was not permitted. Berms were created on the down slope side of the terrace levels to hold water on the site, and prevent erosion. Each berm was ca. 0.5m wide and 0.3 m in height.

Prior to the application of the vegetation and straw treatments, plots were raked to break up the surface crust, minimize inconsistencies of compaction, and reduce microtopography resulting from the machinery. Phosphorus fertilizer (2 g.m - 2) was subsequently applied, as recommended for bog restoration to favour vascular plant establishment (Rochefort et al. 2003). Experimental plots (5 m Á— 5 m) were established on the terraces and were separated by a 1-m buffer. The vegetation treatments were (1) donor diaspore material from the Sphagnum fen, (2) donor diaspore material from the Calamagrostis fen, and (3) a control, without donor diaspore material applied. The donor diaspore material was collected from 18 (1.25 m Á— 1.25 m) random quadrats located within the donor area (25 m Á— 2 m). The ratio of donor diaspore collection area to restored area (1:16) was similar to that suggested for bog restoration (Campeau & Rochefort 1996). The top 10 cm of substrate and vegetation from each donor quadrat was collected by hand and transported to the restoration site, where it was broken into small pieces and spread by hand. The mulch treatments were (1) straw, and (2) a control without straw. The straw was applied with a density of 1500 kg.ha-1 and was spread to exceed the plot boundary to minimize edge effects. Vegetation and mulch treatments were applied to the restoration site during the week of 7-11 May 2001.

Percent cover of the vegetation at the restoration site was surveyed from 10-14 October 2001 and from 8-13 August 2002. Ten quadrats (30 cm Á— 30 cm) in each experimental plot were sampled. The percent cover (visually estimated) for each plant species within each quadrat was recorded. Sampling omitted the border area (0.5 m on each side) of the plots to minimize the observation of edge effects. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: VEGETATION
Two growing seasons after the re-introductions the majority of established plants were fen species, in terms of percent cover and richness. The total species cover at the restoration site doubled during the second year from 12 to 35%. The abundance of fen plants within the experimental plots increased from 5% in the first year to 20 % in the second year. The plant community was composed primarily of forbs and graminoids. There was a small component of woody plants, while bryophytes were largely absent. Trace amounts of bryophyte species were observed in several plots in the first year that were no longer present in the second year. Control plots without straw or diaspore material were primarily devoid of vegetation, while many treatment plots had abundant growth.

Several species established at the restoration site from the donor fen diaspore material, including Glyceria canadensis, Carex canescens, Galium trifidum, Calamagrostis canadensis, Viola macloskeyi, Ranunculus pensylvanicus, Fragaria virginiana, Epilobium ciliatum, and Juncus brevicaudatus. Several other fen species were either introduced via the donor diaspore material or present in the local seed rain, such as Agrostis hyemalis, Scirpus cyperinus, Juncus effusus, and Lycopus uniflorus. Equisetum arvense and Tussilago farfara established an extensive cover on the low terraces. These species are commonly observed growing along the ditches of the cut-over peat fields; their rhizomes were likely left in the ground during preparation of the terraces. Straw mulch introduced a few agricultural species including Secale cereale, Rorippa palustris, and Avena sativa. By the end of the second year only Rorippa palustris was still present.

DONOR DIASPORE TREATMENTS
Donor diaspore treatments (from Sphagnum fen and Calamagrostis fen) increased the abundance of fen species after the first and second growing seasons. During the first year the combination of Sphagnum donor diaspore and straw mulch treatments favoured the abundance of fen species cover and produced the highest total fen species cover of all experimental treatments (9 +/- 1%). Several herbaceous species proliferated with the combined treatments of Sphagnum fen diaspore material and straw mulch including: Viola macloskeyi, Lycopus uniflorus, and Galium trifidum. After the second growing season plots treated with Calamagrostis fen diaspore material (31 +/- 5%) tended to have higher fen cover than Sphagnum fen diaspore material (22 +/- 3%), although these differences were not significant. Both diaspore treatments were significantly higher than control plots (8 +/- 1%).

After the first growing season, the fen plant richness was significantly highest where Sphagnum fen diaspore material (18 +/- 1 taxa) had been applied, intermediate with the application of Calamagrostis fen diaspore material (13 +/- 1 taxa) and lowest without donor diaspore material (6 +/- 1 taxa). The richness of fen plants decreased from the first to second year, and there was no longer a significant difference between the types of donor diaspore material applied (Sphagnum fen = 13 +/- 1; Calamagrostis fen = 12 +/- 1 taxa). Nevertheless, the application of donor diaspore material increased the fen plant richness compared to the control (7 +/- 1 taxa).

STRAW MULCH
The application of straw mulch did not improve the abundance of fen plants after two growing seasons. Only during the first year did straw mulch improve the cover of fen plants from 5 to 9 % in combination with Sphagnum fen diaspore material. These initial increases in fen plant cover did not extend to the second year. More notably, straw mulch clearly increased the richness of fen species from both diaspore materials after two years. Fen plant richness was higher for plots treated with straw mulch (12 +/- 1 taxa) compared to plots without straw mulch (9 +/- 1 taxa). Rorippa palustris was the only species introduced with the straw mulch that persisted over two growing seasons at the restoration site.

TERRACE LEVEL
After two growing seasons there was significantly more fen species cover on the middle terrace level (27 +/- 5%) than the high terrace level (14 +/- 2%). The mean fen species cover on the low terrace level (20 +/- 4%) was between the values observed at the middle and high terrace levels, and was not significantly different from either. Equisetum arvense and Tussilago farfara, the second and third most dominant species after two growing seasons, were dominant on the low terrace level (26 +/- 8 %), whereas they formed only a minor component of the plant cover on the middle (1 +/- 1%), and high terrace (2 +/- 1%) levels. No other experimental treatments had an effect on their establishment and their dominance on the low terrace is presumed to be due to their establishment along the ditches prior to the experiment, rather than a treatment effect.

HYDROLOGY
From May to August 2001 and 2002 the total rainfall was 286 and 253 mm, respectively, compared to the mean 30-yr seasonal total of 353 mm (Environment Canada 1993). The lower terraces were more proximal to the water table and to the underlying clay substrate. The mean depth to water table was  - 29,  - 34 and  - 45 cm for low to high terraces, respectively. This resulted in a water table that sloped toward the central drainage ditch, with a gradient of approximately 0.032 and 0.048 during the wettest (June 4, 2001) and driest (August 16, 2001) period, respectively. Except for brief periods immediately following rain events, the water table in the lowest terrace was always within the clay substrate. In the middle and upper terrace the water table was generally within the peat layer except for during the driest periods. The water table depth at the restoration site was far lower than the donor sites throughout the 2001 growing season. The water table at the donor sites was around  -  4 cm at the Sphagnum fen and + 8 cm at the Calamagrostis fen.

Mean soil-water pressure decreased below  - 100 mb from mid-July to mid-August. Soil-water pressure was less than  -  100 mb at the low, middle, and high terraces 16%, 24%, and 24% of the time, respectively. Soil-water pressure in the upper and middle terrace was similar (averaging  -  66 and  -  62 mb, respectively), in spite of a notable difference in water table.

WATER CHEMISTRY
In general, the concentrations of minerals and nutrients at the restoration site were higher than at the natural fen donor sites. The mean pH levels of the terraces at the restoration site did not vary greatly (ca. 5.9), and were similar to the Calamagrostis fen donor site (5.8), while the Sphagnum fen donor site had a lower mean pH (5.5). The electrical conductivity of the restoration site was higher than that of the natural fens and the low terrace values were higher than the other two terraces. The major cations followed a pattern similar to the electrical conductivity.

The nitrogen and phosphorus levels at the restoration site were moderate and are considered mesotrophic (Bridgham et al. 1996). The mean concentration of available P at the restoration site was higher than the natural fens, but within the observed range of variability. The concentrations of ammonium and nitrate on the lowest terrace level of the restoration site were similar to the natural fens, whereas the middle and high terrace levels tended to have higher concentrations.

PEAT CHEMISTRY
Total nutrients (N, P, and K) of the restoration site tended to be lower or equal to the donor fens. The mean total nitrogen concentration at the restoration site (17.96 mg.g-1) was between the mean concentration of the Sphagnum fen (10.11 mg.g-1) and Calamagrostis fen (19.92 mg.g-1). Total phosphorus concentrations of the peat were lower at the restoration site (0.34 mg.g-1) than the Sphagnum (0.58 mg.g-1) and Calamagrostis (1.18 mg.g-1) fens. Similarly, potassium concentrations were generally lower at the restoration site than the natural fens.

In contrast, the concentrations of the other mineral elements present in the peat including calcium, magnesium, sodium, and iron, were higher at the restoration site than at the reference sites. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Water availability is an important factor affecting fen restoration success (Roth et al. 1999), fen species distribution (e.g. Bridgham & Richardson 1993), and number of plant niches (Silvertown et al. 1999). Reintroduction of fen species by plantings was the most effective with water table levels slightly below the surface or with shallow standing water (Cooper & MacDonald 2002). The extremely dry conditions of the restoration site are likely limiting the establishment of a fen plant community. The water tables at the donor sites were consistently just below or above the surface, whereas the surface peat of the restoration site was dry throughout the growing seasons, except immediately following rain events. Further rewetting measures are considered necessary to create fen-like hydrological setting at the restoration site, and ultimately to create a fen system rather than simply restoring fen species (Grootjans & van Diggelen 1995). However, the freedom to manipulate the sites hydrology was constrained by drainage requirements of adjacent peat extraction activities.

Water quality is considered as important as water availability for fen restoration (Charman 2002; Lamers et al. 2002). In this experiment, the higher concentration of solutes in deeper peat results from the diffusion of salts from the marine clay (Van Seters & Price, unpubl. data for Cacouna peatland, Québec, 1999). Some of these solutes may migrate more quickly above the water table by capillary rise, and become more concentrated by evaporation. During the summer the net direction of solute transport is upwards, similar to the net water flow direction (i.e. driven by evaporative water losses). The concentrations of solutes within the peat substrate were considerably higher than the donor sites and may be one factor that lowered the success of fen plant recolonization.
The application of donor diaspore material from natural fens clearly increased the cover and richness of fen species compared to control plots. Diaspore material led to the establishment of several species at the restoration site that were absent from neighbouring abandoned fields and the nearby natural bog. This provides evidence that the establishment of fen vegetation is hampered by dispersal, rather than conditions at the restoration site. After two years, several graminoid and herbaceous species from the Calamagrostis fen formed a dominant vegetation cover at the restoration site, despite unfavourable water table conditions.
The advantages of applying diaspore material as a plant introduction technique are numerous. Firstly, the variety of propagule species and types contained within the donor diaspore material increases the chances that some of the species biological requirements will match the environmental conditions of a site and the particular climatic conditions of a given year. Secondly, the inclusion of the substrate with the diaspore material means that soil mycorrhizal fungi associated with the plant community are also brought to the site. Mycorrhizal fungi may be of great importance in wetland plant communities (Turner & Friese 1998; Thormann et al. 1999). Thirdly, insect larvae and other disseminules may also be brought to the site within the substrate, further aiding plant community establishment by acting as dispersal agents (Middleton 1999). Finally, if the donor diaspore material is collected in the spring, it allows propagules to fulfil their natural dormancy cycle under their native conditions. This may be of great importance for establishing Carex species, an important component of fen plant communities, which have been shown to have complex dormancy cycles and species-specific germination traits (Baskin et al. 1996; Schultz 1998; Patzelt et al. 2001).
A disadvantage of applying donor diaspore material as a reintroduction method is the disturbance caused to the donor wetland community during diaspore collection. However, informal observations of the disturbed quadrats (> 4% of the reference unit) of the current study revealed that there was 25 to 40 % recovery by the end of the second growing season. Monitoring the donor sites is warranted if this method is adopted for large-scale restoration projects in the future.
After two years, straw mulch significantly increased the diversity of fen plants. Only during the first year was there a synergistic effect on fen species abundance with straw mulch and Sphagnum fen diaspore material treatments. The straw mulch may facilitate the germination and early stages of establishment of some species due to improved water conditions (Price et al. 1998), whereas mulch may inhibit other species and later stages of plant development by shading, obstructing plants, attracting predators or promoting pathogens (Xiong & Nilsson 1997). In previous studies, cover treatments improved the germination of vascular plants, including Eriophorum angustifolium, Molinia and Calluna; however, other species such as E. vaginatum failed to respond to the same treatments (Sliva & Pfadenhauer 1999). Straw mulch did not improve the establishment of vascular plants in bog restoration attempts, whereas the establishment of mosses, particularly Sphagnum species, was substantially improved (Rochefort et al. 2003). For fen restoration sites where better rewetting can be achieved, mulching could prove to have a greater effect, particularly for helping mosses to establish.
It was hypothesized at the project’s outset that the terrace level with environmental conditions closest to the natural fen donor sites would support the highest fen plant establishment. The intermediate terrace level had the highest fen species cover after two years. The environmental conditions of the middle terrace level may represent a compromise between the extremely dry conditions of the high terrace level, and the more minerotrophic conditions of the lowest terrace level. Several non-target species became established at the restoration site, most notably, Equisetum arvense and Tussilago farfara, but these species appear to have spread from the adjacent ditch to the lower terrace. The establishment of invasive, weedy species has been observed elsewhere in Europe (Rowlands 2001) and North America (Cooper & MacDonald 2002) on cut-over sites with minerotrophic peat. In Finland, the abundance of E. arvense and T. farfara was lower on older minerotrophic peat fields, suggesting a decrease in dominance over time (Salonen 1990), so these species may not be a concern in the long-term. Further monitoring of the vegetation community is required to determine whether there is convergence with the donor fen plant communities over time, or increased dominance of non-target species. "

Se han realizado con éxito algunas iniciativas de reforestación con diversas coníferas, especialmente pinos, pero no hay, hasta el momento, mayor información sobre forestaciones con especies del Bosque Serrano. Los objetivos del presente trabajo fueron evaluar el comportamiento de 6 especies forestales nativas del Chaco Occidental, en plantaciones experimentales en zonas de pastizales de altura de las Sierras de Córdoba e identificar la/s especie/s de mejor comportamiento. En ocho plantaciones se estudiaron la sobrevivencia y altura del eje principal en función de la exposición, la posición en la ladera y la época de plantación de Lithraea ternifolia (Gillies) Barkley, “molle de beber”; Schinopsis haenkeana Engler, “quebracho colorado serrano, horco quebracho”; Celtis tala Gill. Ex Planchon, “tala”; Schinus areira L.,”aguaribay, pimentero”; Prosopis alba Griseb, “algarrobo blanco”, y Prosopis nigra (Griseb) Hieron, “algarrobo negro”. También se analizó el estado general de los plantines en relación a la vegetación acompañante. Las condiciones ambientales de este piso fitogeográfico fueron desventajosas, manifestándose baja sobrevivencia y reducción en la altura promedio luego de varios años de plantación, con excepción de L. ternifolia. Las plantas presentaron mejor sobrevivencia y estado general bajo la protección de los pastos acompañantes, o en el borde de los mismos. La mejor época de plantación fue la primavera y las exposiciones más propicias para el arraigo de las plantas fueron la norte y oeste. En cambio, el mayor crecimiento promedio en altura se produjo en L. ternifolia en la exposición sur.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry El bosque serrano de Córdoba ha sido objeto de un intenso proceso de degradación por la acción antrópica. Entre las causas diversas de esta degradación, se identifican incendios, sobrepastoreo, talas excesivas, etc. Las Sierras de Córdoba presentan una diversidad de ambientes que dan lugar a pisos de vegetación cuya existencia y distribución están condicionadas, principalmente, por la constitución geológica, la altitud y la exposición u orientación geográfica.
El Bosque Serrano comprende el piso de vegetación más destacado, extendiéndose entre los 500 y los 1.300 m de altura. Por su estratégica localización, en las partes bajas de las cabeceras de las cuencas de captación, esta formación cumple una importante función protectora, influyendo en gran medida en el aporte de agua a los valles donde se localizan los asentamientos humanos. No menos importante en la regulación de las cuencas hídricas es la vegetación de los pisos superiores, el romerillar o matorral serrano y los pastizales de altura, donde tienen origen los cursos de agua que bajan hacia los valles.
Entre las especies nativas la más representativa es el molle de beber, Lithraea ternifolia (Gillies) Barkley, que junto con el coco, Fagara coco (Gill.) Engler, llegan hasta las mayores alturas de este piso. El otro elemento principal del bosque es el horco quebracho o quebracho serrano, Schinopsis haenkeana Engler, que ocupa solamente la faja inferior del piso forestal, alcanzando en algunas áreas los 1.000 o 1.100 m de elevación. De los árboles de la llanura que ascienden parcialmente los faldeos inferiores o que penetran por los valles, cañadones y quebradas hasta 1.000 m de elevación, se destacan los algarrobos blancos, Prosopis alba Griseb. y Prosopis chilensis (Mol.) Stuntz, algarrobos negros, Prosopis nigra (Griseb) Hieron y P. flexuosa D.C., el espinillo, Acacia caven (Mol.) Molina, y el tala, Celtis tala Gill. Ex Planchon.
El molle tiende a ocupar naturalmente los sitios más frescos y húmedos, con preferencia en las laderas expuestas al sur, mientras que el horco quebracho “ocupa, en Argentina, vertientes con orientación norte y oeste preferentemente, más secas y cálidas, donde puede constituir comunidades puras de densidad variable”. También prospera en laderas orientales, como las de las Sierras Norte y Orcosuni, el cordón sedimentario Pajarillo-Copacabana-Masa, y en valles longitudinales de las Sierras Chicas (El Diquecito, en el Depto. Santa María), mostrando la influencia de otros factores, además de los termopluviométricos, en el desarrollo y dispersión de la especie. a) evaluar el comportamiento inicial de 6 especies forestales nativas del Chaco Occidental, en plantaciones experimentales en zonas de pastizales de altura de las Sierras de Córdoba, en función de la época de plantación, la exposición, la ubicación en la ladera y la posición relativa con respecto a la vegetación acompañante
b) identificar la/s especie/s de mejor desempeño, en términos de sobrevivencia y crecimiento en altura, en las condiciones del ensayo.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Las especies seleccionadas fueron molle, L. ternifolia, horco quebracho, S. haenkeana, tala, C. tala, aguaribay, S. areira y algarrobos, P. alba y P. nigra. El ensayo consistió en ocho plantaciones experimentales dispuestas en lotes de 52 m x 12 m, cercados con alambre tejido. A fin de estudiar el efecto de la exposición, la posición en la ladera y la época de plantación, en marzo de 1995 se instalaron cuatro plantaciones en la parte alta de laderas orientadas, respectivamente, hacia los cuatro puntos cardinales (denominadas, de aquí en adelante, plantaciones en ladera alta). En noviembre de 1997 se efectuaron las cuatro restantes, en la parte baja de las mismas laderas (de aquí en adelante, plantaciones en ladera baja). En esa misma fecha se repusieron las plantas muertas en ladera alta (reposición de fallas). Esto permitió, luego, comparar las dos épocas de plantación (otoño vs primavera) y la posición en la ladera (ladera alta vs ladera baja) en términos de sobrevivencia y altura de las plantas. Por falta de plantines no se efectuó reposición de P. nigra, salvo 5 plantas en exposición sur y una en exposición oeste. Dado el bajo crecimiento de las plantas, la reposición de fallas, realizada 32 meses después de la plantación, no sufrió competencia por parte de las plantas ya instaladas, por lo que pudo considerarse como una nueva plantación.

Tanto en ladera alta como ladera baja se instaló un ensayo bajo un diseño en bloques completamente aleatorizados con estructura de tratamientos en parcelas divididas, siendo las cuatro exposiciones (norte, sur, oeste y este) los tratamientos principales y las seis especies los secundarios. El diseño constaba de 4 plantas por unidad experimental en 5 repeticiones de modo tal que resultaron 120 plantas por plantación (20 ejemplares/especie x 6 especies), 240 plantas por exposición y 960 plantas en total.

Los plantines se produjeron en el vivero forestal de Silvicultura (FCA, UNC), situado en la ciudad de Córdoba. Se usaron envases de polietileno cristal de 560 cm3, con una mezcla de tierra y arena gruesa. Se protegieron con media sombra y se regaron convenientemente. A campo, las plantas de 6-12 meses (altura de 15-40 cm según especie) se dispusieron en marco real, a 2 m x 2 m. Se efectuó un riego de plantación y control periódico de hormigas.

Sobre cada planta se midieron las siguientes variables:

Ladera alta:
--Plantación marzo/1995 (otoño):
sobrevivencia a los 7 y 61 meses de la plantación;
altura del eje principal a los 0, 7, 19, 24, 32, 37 y 61 meses de la plantación;
condición del plantín a los 61 meses de la plantación;
posición relativa del plantín con respecto a la vegetación existente a los 61 meses de la plantación.
--Reposición de fallas noviembre/1997 (primavera):
sobrevivencia a los 5 y 29 meses de la plantación;
altura del eje principal a los 0, 5 y 29 meses de la plantación.

Ladera baja
--Plantación noviembre/1997 (primavera):
sobrevivencia a los 29 meses de la plantación;
altura del eje principal a los 0, 5 y 29 meses de la plantación;
condición del plantín a los 29 meses de la plantación;
posición relativa del plantín con respecto a la vegetación existente a los 29 meses de la plantación.

Dado que la reposición en ladera alta y la plantación en ladera baja se realizaron 36 meses después de la iniciación del ensayo en ladera alta, la última medición, que en ladera alta se efectuó a los 61 meses de la plantación, coincidió con los 29 meses de la reposición y de la plantación en ladera baja.

La variable condición del plantín fue utilizada para reflejar el estado general de los mismos a través de una escala cualitativa. Esta considera la altura del eje principal, el número y estado de las hojas, el color y el estado sanitario. Se determinaron las siguientes categorías en escala ordinal: 1. malo, 2. regular, 3. bueno y 4. muy bueno. Por ejemplo, la categoría 4 es otorgada a un plantín alto, vigoroso, con abundante cantidad de hojas, de color verde y buena sanidad, mientras que se categorizó 1 a un plantín débil, con muy pocas hojas, o sin ellas, cloróticas o enfermas.

La variable posición relativa del plantín con respecto a la vegetación existente se generó para evaluar el efecto de la vegetación acompañante sobre la sobrevivencia de los plantines. Se determinaron 3 categorías: 1. bajo cobertura, 2. ecotono (en el borde de la cobertura) y 3. fuera (sin cobertura). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: SOBREVIVENCIA
--En función de la época de plantación--
En términos generales, la sobrevivencia al cabo de medio año de la plantación fue mayor en la plantación primaveral. Algunas especies tuvieron valores promedio de sobrevivencia muy bajos en plantación otoñal, hasta hacerse cero en el caso de horco quebracho. Este comportamiento no dependió de la exposición a la que estuviera sometida la especie, indicando ausencia de interacción época de plantación-exposición. Por su parte, las exposiciones difirieron entre sí, siendo la Este la más adversa tanto en plantación otoñal como primaveral.

Se observó interacción entre la época de plantación y la especie. En la plantación otoñal los algarrobos tuvieron buena respuesta en todas las exposiciones, molle fue mejor en la exposicion Sur y horco quebracho no sobrevivió. En la plantación de primavera, el desbalanceamiento de datos dificultó el análisis de contrastes específicos que permitieran indagar la naturaleza de la interacción. El promedio de sobrevivencia de las especies estuvo entre el 93% y el 99%, no existiendo, por lo tanto, diferencias significativas entre ellas.

--En función de la ubicación en la ladera--
El análisis de la sobrevivencia en ladera alta y en ladera baja, luego de cinco meses de la plantación primaveral, indica que en ambas existe interacción de los factores exposición y especie. En ladera alta, la exposición Este resulta la más desfavorable para todas las especies, particularmente para el tala. En ladera baja, también esta exposición fue la de menor sobrevivencia, pero solamente para el tala y el algarrobo negro.

--En función de la exposición-- 
Tanto en ladera alta como ladera baja se detectó interacción significativa entre los factores exposición y especie debido a que las especies no se comportan de la misma forma en todas las exposiciones.

No obstante, la exposición Norte fue, en términos generales, la de mejor desempeño al cabo de 61 meses de la plantación. Así, por ejemplo, en ladera alta, el molle mostró una sobrevivencia significativamente mayor que las demás especies. El aguaribay y los algarrobos negro y blanco, de comportamiento similar, mostraron mayor tendencia a sobrevivir (30-35%) en la exposición Norte, inversamente a lo que ocurrió con horco quebracho y tala, siendo esta última la especie de menor sobrevivencia.

En ladera baja, a los 29 meses de la plantación, molle también presentó mayor sobrevivencia que el resto de las especies; sin embargo, la exposición más favorable fue la Oeste. Solamente en las exposiciones Norte y Este algarrobo blanco se asemejó a molle en cuanto a su alta sobrevivencia. El resto de las especies presentaron alta mortalidad en todas las exposiciones.

--En función de la vegetación acompañante-- 
En las plantaciones en ladera alta la sobrevivencia general de las especies fue semejante en las categorías bajo cobertura y ecotono, salvo en la exposición Este, donde las plantas tuvieron mayor sobrevivencia bajo cobertura. No obstante, como existe asociación entre especie y categoría, en el análisis por especie es posible observar que, mientras la mayoría de las especies sobrevivieron significativamente bajo cobertura, molle sobrevivió indistintamente bajo cobertura o en el borde (ecotono), salvo en la exposición Este, donde prefirió la posición bajo cobertura.

En ladera baja, las especies con mayor sobrevivencia (molle, algarrobo blanco y aguaribay) también lo hicieron, en términos generales, bajo cobertura o en el borde (ecotono). No hubo interacción entre los factores exposición y especie dada la ubicación del individuo; sólo molle mostró cierta tendencia a sobrevivir en la exposición Sur, fuera de la protección de la vegetación existente.

--Condición de los plantines-- 
En ladera alta, a los 61 meses de la plantación, las especies presentaban condiciones generales diferentes entre sí, destacándose el molle por su condición buena y muy buena, en todas las exposiciones. Se observó, además, que los mejores individuos se hallaron, predominantemente, bajo cobertura o en el borde de la vegetación existente.

En ladera baja, molle también sobresalió por mostrar individuos buenos y muy buenos, pero esta vez acompañado por aguaribay, y en todas las exposiciones, con una tendencia a la disminución en exposición Sur.

ALTURA DEL EJE PRINCIPAL
--En función de la época de plantación-- 
Al analizar las diferencias de alturas entre el momento de la plantación/reposición y la siguiente medición, efectuada a los 7 y 5 meses respectivamente, todas las especies mostraron diferencias significativas entre ambas épocas de plantación. La plantación primaveral resultó la de mejor desempeño y, entre las exposiciones, la Sur fue la más favorable, mientras que la Este fue la peor. El molle, con buen crecimiento en plantación primaveral, no mostró la misma respuesta en plantación de otoño, a pesar de ser una de las especies menos perjudicadas durante el invierno.

--En función de la ubicación en la ladera--
Las tres especies analizadas (horco quebracho, molle y algarrobo blanco) crecen más en ladera alta que baja en la exposición Sur. Algarrobo blanco repite este patrón en el resto de las exposiciones, mientras que molle sólo en la Norte.

--En función de la exposición--
En ladera alta la única exposición que mostró diferencia positiva contrastante con el resto fue la exposición Sur. Las exposiciones Norte y Oeste fueron las de peor respuesta.

En términos generales, las especies también mostraron desempeños distintos. No obstante, como no todas las especies sobrevivieron en todas las exposiciones, esas diferencias fueron analizadas sólo en la exposición Sur. Molle se destacó con un crecimiento positivo en altura, seguido por aguaribay. La primera especie alcanzó alturas promedio aproximadamente tres veces superiores a la inicial al cabo de 5 años de plantación (24,28 cm el 19/3/95 vs 60,27 cm el 27/3/00).

En ladera baja, los plantines de la exposición Oeste, que habían presentado la mayor tasa de sobrevivencia, mostraron tendencia a crecer menos que en las exposiciones Este y Sur. Se detectó interacción de los factores exposición y especie, indicando que las especies se comportaron diferencialmente según la exposición. Este comportamiento diferencial está dado por P. nigra, que en la exposición Este, y a pesar de su bajísima tasa de sobrevivencia, presentó un incremento en altura significativamente mayor que el resto de las especies. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Aguaribay tuvo un pobre desempeño. Su sobrevivencia fue baja en todas las exposiciones (máxima 38%, en exposición Norte, ladera baja) y su altura no varió significativamente con respecto a la altura de plantación, en promedio, cualquiera fuera la exposición o la posición en la ladera. Era de esperar que la especie tuviera mejor performance debido a que crece naturalmente en Perú, en estepas espinosas y bosques montanos bajos, trepando hasta los 3.650 m s.n.m.; allí es usada con buenos resultados en sistemas silvopastorales. Asimismo, Brack Egg menciona plantaciones exitosas de Schinus areira en zonas de sierra de Perú con fines de protección ambiental, ornamental o de producción de leña.

Horco quebracho y tala se mostraron totalmente inadecuadas para plantaciones en la zona, lo que queda de manifiesto por su bajísima tasa de sobrevivencia al final del ensayo. Si bien horco quebracho crece en Bolivia en laderas secas y pedregosas, con fuertes pendientes, hasta 2.700 m s.n.m., es probable que las condiciones de reclutamiento de la especie en los sitios de dispersión natural sean menos adversas que las del ensayo. El tala, por su parte, mostró muy pobre desempeño. Al cabo de cinco años de la plantación otoñal en ladera alta la sobrevivencia fue nula en todas las exposiciones. Siendo el tala una especie preferentemente de llanura y a pesar de su resistencia a bajas temperaturas, es evidente que no soporta las condiciones climáticas y edáficas imperantes en el sitio de plantación.

La plantación de algarrobos blanco y negro, por su parte, no arrojó resultados satisfactorios para ninguna de las dos especies. Si bien algarrobo blanco alcanzó un 78% de sobrevivencia en ladera baja, ni éste ni algarrobo negro superaron el 35% en ladera alta. La mayor sobrevivencia del primero no se correspondió con el crecimiento en altura, que resultó muy bajo para la especie. A la inversa, algarrobo negro, del cual subsistieron escasos ejemplares en ladera baja, sobrepasó al resto de las especies en crecimiento en altura, en la exposición Este, no obstante, el incremento fue apenas de 11,2 cm en 2,5 años. Ambas especies prosperan principalmente en el fondo de los valles o en las lomadas bajas, asociadas con suelos bastante profundos y con la humedad de los cursos de agua. A pesar de la cercanía geográfica con su área de distribución natural, las condiciones de suelos someros, bajas temperaturas y fuertes vientos, imperantes en la zona del ensayo, fueron desfavorables para su establecimiento. Estos resultados confirman anteriores experiencias realizadas por el equipo de trabajo en la región.
El establecimiento de algunas especies valiosas del Chaco occidental en áreas de pastizales de altura resulta sumamente dificultoso. Las condiciones ambientales de este piso fitogeográfico se presentan muy desventajosas para las especies estudiadas, lo que queda de manifiesto en la baja sobrevivencia y la reducción en la altura promedio al cabo de varios años de plantación, con la sola excepción del molle.
El molle resultó la mejor de las especies en términos de sobrevivencia, altura del eje principal y condición general de los plantines, particularmente en ladera alta. Cabe notar que mientras la sobrevivencia de esta especie al cabo de 5 años fue mayor en exposición Norte (70%), el mejor crecimiento en altura se produjo en la exposición Sur. Esta última favoreció, además, una muy buena condición general de los plantines, en concordancia con observaciones efectuadas por diversos autores que indican la preferencia natural de molle para ocupar los sitios más frescos y húmedos en las laderas expuestas al Sur.
La época de plantación fue determinante para la sobrevivencia y el crecimiento en altura del eje principal de las plantas durante los primeros meses, resultando más favorable la plantación de primavera que la de otoño. Mientras el déficit hídrico es un factor muy importante para el establecimiento de coníferas en la zona, las temperaturas mínimas parecen serlo para las especies nativas. Así, las coníferas pueden superar inviernos rigurosos si cuentan con una adecuada reserva de agua en el suelo, mientras que las especies probadas en este ensayo sufrieron las consecuencias de las bajas temperaturas invernales. Prueba de ello son los daños observados a la salida del invierno en hojas y tallos. Muchas plantas rebrotaban con la llegada de la primavera, pero volvían a sufrir daños al invierno siguiente.
Una alternativa válida, al menos para las especies que mostraron mejor sobrevivencia y crecimiento, sería la utilización de plantines de mayor edad y tamaño (12-24 meses-0,50/0,80 m), plantados a mediados de la primavera, luego de una lluvia abundante. Con esto se esperaría un mayor tamaño inicial de las plantas, mayor rusticidad, y, por tanto, mejor tolerancia a heladas, la que está directamente relacionada con la edad del plantín y su rusticidad. Ensayos con plantines de Prosopis juliflora de 45 a 120 cm se llevaron a cabo con éxito en la India (Luna 1996, citado por Pasiecznik), pero es muy importante proveerles un abundante pan de tierra para el desarrollo equilibrado de los sistemas aéreo y radicular.
En cuanto al efecto de la exposición, los resultados fueron disímiles según la variable analizada. La sobrevivencia fue, en líneas generales, mayor en la exposición Norte, para todas las especies, tanto en ladera baja como alta, salvo para el molle, que en ladera baja tuvo mayor sobrevivencia en las exposiciones Oeste y Este. En términos de crecimiento en altura del eje principal, la exposición que se diferenció del resto fue la Sur, pero sólo por el desempeño del molle en ladera alta. La aparente discrepancia en el comportamiento de las variables se explica si se considera la susceptibilidad de estas especies a las bajas temperaturas. Es posible que las especies sobrevivan más en la exposición Norte por su mayor temperatura invernal, a pesar de que esta exposición exhibe un déficit hídrico más pronunciado. La menor sobrevivencia en exposición Sur se ve compensada, en el caso del molle, por un mayor crecimiento en altura, favorecido por condiciones más frescas y sombreadas que reducen la evapotranspiración, preferidas por la especie.
Los resultados indican que las especies crecen más en ladera alta que baja. Si bien éste es sólo un análisis exploratorio para detectar tendencias, efectuado a los pocos meses de la plantación, esta diferencia a favor de la ladera alta podría atribuirse a mayores temperaturas, tanto de invierno como de verano, ya que la ladera baja actuaría como depósito de masas de aire frío que se acumulan, por su mayor peso, en estas zonas.
Por otra parte, el efecto de la cobertura de la vegetación acompañante sobre la sobrevivencia y la condición general de los plantines fue significativo. Las mayores tasas de sobrevivencia y las plantas de mejor condición general se produjeron bajo la cobertura de la vegetación herbácea acompañante. Esta respuesta puede deberse, principalmente, a la protección que proporcionan los pastos altos contra las variaciones extremas de temperatura y, en particular, las bajas temperaturas del invierno a las que las especies estudiadas resultaron muy sensibles. Si bien el grueso de la bibliografía hace referencia al efecto benéfico de ciertos arbustos sobre la germinación y el crecimiento de algunas especies en zonas áridas y semiáridas, los mismos principios de modificación de microhábitats serían de aplicación para los pastizales de altura donde se instaló el presente ensayo. Así, los individuos que se implanten bajo la cobertura de los pastos, o en su área de influencia, tendrían mayores probabilidades de sobrevivir a las condiciones climáticas rigurosas en las mayores alturas de las Sierras de Córdoba.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/chile-reforestacion-de-los-bosquetes-de-olivillo-en-el-parque-nacional-bosque-fray-jorge/	Chile: Reforestación de los Bosquetes de Olivillo en el Parque Nacional Bosque Fray Jorge	Chile	1999-06-02	2001-06-02	"Con el propósito de evaluar las posibilidades de aumentar la masa boscosa del Bosque Fray Jorge, sellar los claros y unir los fragmentos, se inició un programa de plantación en 1999 con una duración de tres años. El objetivo fue contribuir a la restitución de la condición ambiental del bosque, en sus aspectos cuantitativos y cualitativos. Las plantaciones con las especies Aextoxicon punctatum Ruiz et Pav. (Olivillo), Myrceugenia correifolia Hook et Arn. (Petrillo) y Drimys winteri J.R. Forst. et G. Forst. (Canelo) se efectuaron en claros y bordes de diversos tamaños, considerando siempre la protección de Baccharis vernalis F.H. Hellwig (vautro). Como medida de mantención, en forma semanal a cada planta se le aplican cinco litros de agua durante el primer año. En el segundo año la misma tasa de riego se aplicó cada 15 días. Durante el primer semestre del tercer año la frecuencia de riego fue mensual. El agua se obtuvo de la captación de neblinas por medio de atrapanieblas. Los resultados indicaron que los mejores porcentajes de sobrevivencia se obtuvieron en sitios de Bordes y Claros Abiertos (95%). Por otra parte, se determinó que olivillo presentó mayor sobrevivencia promedio de los tres años (97%) y crecimiento diametral, particularmente en ejemplares de dos años de edad.Fragmentation, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Desde el descubrimiento del bosque existió una presión antrópica constante, principalmente sobre el recurso maderero que ofrecía Fray Jorge, con lo cual se produjo una importante alteración en el ecosistema, siendo éste fuertemente fragmentado, a tal grado que, en la actualidad, se considera que sólo constituye un borde. La pérdida de la continuidad del dosel repercutió significativamente sobre la dinámica de captación de neblinas, precipitando una importante disminución en el proceso de regeneración del bosque.
En la actualidad, la fisionomía general del bosque, está caracterizada por la presencia de grandes claros, que son colonizados por especies arbustivas del matorral xerófito, lo que ha ido creando un paisaje de bosque fragmentado constituido por un pequeño número de árboles (bosquetes), en cuyo interior se aprecia la ausencia de los diferentes estados regenerativos de las especies dominantes, en donde prevalecen árboles senescentes, de mala forma y por lo general en proceso de desmoronamiento. El bosque de olivillo de Fray Jorge, es la agrupación laurifoliada más septentrional de Chile (Philippi, 1930). Se sitúa en la vertiente occidental de la cumbre de un cordón montañoso costero (altos de Talinay), expuesto a un intenso régimen hídrico dado por las abundantes neblinas comunes a lo largo del año. El bosque se encuentra inserto en una zona donde las escasas precipitaciones permiten sólo el desarrollo de una vegetación del tipo xerófila y, en algunos lugares más favorables en régimen hídrico, vegetación de tipo esclerófila.
Una de las características de la dinámica de regeneración de este bosque fragmentado es que se regenera en forma natural principalmente en los frentes donde predominan las neblinas, la cual lo penetra y humedece constantemente. Dentro de esta dinámica, la facilitación entre especies juega un rol determinante (Pugnaire et al 1966, Holmgren et al. 1997, Teilborger & Kadmon 2000), lo que se expresa en el reclutamiento de plantas de las especies olivillo y petrillo por parte del arbusto vautro aprovechando su condición natural como captador de neblinas. De este modo, en la selección de cada uno de los sitios se consideró la presencia de vautro y de la abundancia de neblinas. Expandir y enriquecer los bosquetes, sellar claros y unir fragmentos de bosquetes, estableciendo una superficie cercana a 5 ha con las especies leñosas dominantes del bosque–que son olivillo, petrillo y canelo. Por otra parte, evaluar el efecto del tipo de microhábitat determinado por las características de la cobertura leñosa y claro producido, las especies y la edad de las plantas en el establecimiento y desarrollo de las mismas.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Las plantaciones experimentales se realizaron cada año entre los meses de junio y julio, época que presenta las mejores condiciones para esta actividad, con mayores probabilidades de precipitación, alta humedad ambiental y bajas temperaturas, condiciones indispensables para atenuar el impacto del proceso de plantación. Para tales efectos, se confeccionaron manualmente hoyos de 40 x 40 x 30 cm, localizadas bajo la cobertura de vautro.

Las plantas utilizadas fueron del tipo 1:0 (un año de permanencia en el lugar de siembra, sin transplante en el vivero) para el primer año de plantación (1999) y de 1:1 (un año de permanencia en el lugar de siembra original, maceta, y un año de transplante en el vivero a macetas de mayor desarrollo) para los años sucesivos, las que fueron producidas en el vivero del Parque Nacional Bosque de Fray Jorge. Se instalaron en terreno en una proporción de 5 olivillos: 3 petrillos: 2 canelos, de acuerdo a lo recomendado por Gajardo y Grez (1992). 

No se definió una densidad regular de plantación, con el propósito de generar individuos distribuidos de manera cercana a la natural. No obstante, se usó como referencia general un distanciamiento de 3 x 3 metros. En la práctica, por la necesidad de acomodar la plantación respecto al arbusto vautro, el distanciamiento definitivo resultó ser superior.

Cada ejemplar fue rodeado de una protección, en forma de cilindro, consistente en un armazón de alambre metálico, recubierto de malla tipo ""Rashell"". El propósito de esta estructura fue impedir la herbivoría, como también proteger las plantas de la acción del viento, proporcionar condiciones de semisombra y, a su vez, servir como eventuales microcaptadores de neblinas.

Las plantaciones se establecieron en los siguientes tres tipos de microhábitat:

Claro pequeño o cerrado: Superficie inferior a 0,4 ha, de forma irregular, ubicada al interior de un bosquete, caracterizada por no poseer vegetación arbórea continua y uniforme, generada normalmente por la caída de árboles senescentes, aunque pueden haber otros factores, como el resultado de la acumulación de daños exógenos y de enfermedades (White 1979).

Claro grande o abierto: Superficie mayor a 0,4 ha, de forma variable, ubicada en el exterior de bosquetes, limitada al menos por dos de éstos, caracterizada por no poseer vegetación arbórea continua y uniforme. Esto permite una libre circulación de las neblinas.

Zona de borde de bosquetes: Superficie adyacente y exterior al bosquete, de ancho variable (3 a 9 m de ancho) de acuerdo a la influencia ejercida por los árboles en la vegetación del exterior. Se consideró, además, la dirección de las neblinas y su efecto favorable sobre la regeneración de las especies leñosas del lugar. De este modo, las zonas de borde se ubicaron a barlovento de los bosquetes, que correspondían a sectores de exposición general suroeste - oeste y que presentaban características de mayor humedad (Gajardo & Grez 1990).

En la temporada 1999 se plantó un total de 449 ejemplares, en siete sectores diferentes, con una participación de 229 ejemplares de olivillo, 134 de petrillo y 86 de canelo. Los ejemplares plantados se seleccionaron de acuerdo a una altura mÁ¬nima de 5 cm y un adecuado nivel de lignificación del tallo, dentro del material disponible en vivero. La plantación se programó con riego mediante agua proveniente de un sistema de captación de agua de neblina, de acuerdo a una tasa de riego de 5 litros semanales por planta. Para efectos de evaluación de las plantaciones la variable respuesta fue el prendimiento y supervivencia de los ejemplares, medidos cada tres meses a partir del momento de iniciada la plantación.

En la temporada 2000 se plantaron 509 ejemplares de olivillo, 298 de petrillo y 143 de canelo; en total, 950 ejemplares. En forma adicional, se instaló un ensayo con el objeto de evaluar el comportamiento de las variables riego (con y sin riego), edad de la planta (1 y 2 años) y el efecto protector de la vegetación arbustiva (con vautro y sin vautro), en olivillo y petrillo.

Entre julio y agosto del 2001 se plantaron otros 1.011 ejemplares, casi en su totalidad con riego tecnificado por goteo. De este modo, el total de plantas instaladas en terreno durante el período evaluado fue de 3.600 individuos, que cubren una superficie aproximada de 4,2 hectáreas, distribuidas aleatoriamente en la zona de estudio, con una densidad de plantación de 877 ejemplares por hectárea.

Durante el año 2001, los riegos con agua provenientes de neblina, se fueron distanciando para las primeras plantaciones, conforme los ejemplares se iban desarrollando, considerando que eran capaces de iniciar su propia cosecha de neblinas, sin perjuicio de una mayor penetración del sistema radical hacia horizontes más húmedos. De este modo, el criterio fue aplicar como máximo un riego semanal de 2,5 l por ejemplar, dependiendo de las condiciones de humedad del lugar. Así, las plantaciones de 1999, las más antiguas, recibían 5 l de agua cada 30 días; las del 2000, 5 l cada 15 días y las del 2001, las más recientes, 5 l semanales. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: En la evaluación de junio del 2000 de las plantaciones efectuadas en 1999, se obtuvo una sobrevivencia general de 62%, de acuerdo al siguiente detalle: olivillo 98%, petrillo 60% y canelo 27%. Estos resultados se atribuyeron a los distintos requerimientos hídricos de las especies.

Las plantaciones realizadas durante los años 1999 y 2000 alcanzaron un número superior a las 2.200 plantas, con una superficie equivalente de dos hectáreas.

A los seis meses de efectuada la plantación del 2.000 individuos, en enero del 2001, la sobrevivencia era: olivillo 100%, petrillo 98% y canelo 100%. Estos buenos resultados, superiores a los de la plantación del año anterior, se atribuyeron a un mayor tiempo de permanencia de las plantas en vivero y a cambios en el tamaño de las macetas. En efecto, los ejemplares permanecieron dos años en el vivero y, al cumplir el primer año, fueron transplantados de macetas de 10 x 16 cm a macetas de 15 x 25 cm. Ello se tradujo en mayor desarrollo de los ejemplares que, en enero del 2001, mostraban las siguientes alturas promedio: olivillo 12,54 cm, petrillo 11,59 cm y canelo 13,62 cm; en tanto que los diámetros al nivel del cuello eran de 0,34, 0,25 y 0,46 cm, respectivamente.

En el control final de diciembre del 2001, la sobrevivencia continuaba siendo alta: olivillo 94%, petrillo 92% y canelo 96%; en tanto que las alturas eran: olivillo 38,3 cm, petrillo 23,4 cm y canelo 25,5 cm. Los respectivos diámetros al nivel del cuello eran: olivillo 0,76 cm, petrillo 0,48 cm y canelo 0,62 cm. El menor desarrollo relativo de petrillo se vio compensado por una mayor cantidad de hojas por ejemplar: 93,1 contra 39,6 de olivillo y 21,7 de canelo. No obstante, las hojas de estas dos últimas especies eran de mayor tamaño.

La evaluación final de las plantaciones de los años 1999 y 2000 indicó una sobrevivencia promedio de 81%, la que puede ser considerada como muy promisoria, tomando en cuenta que esta evaluación se hizo luego de casi tres años de la primera plantación y que ésta no se realizó con ejemplares de tamaño adecuado. Esto se advierte en que la sobrevivencia general de la plantación de 1999 fue de 62%, en tanto que la del 2000 alcanzó a 99%. De todos modos, es preciso señalar que las condiciones atmosféricas fueron mejores en el 2000 que en 1999. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: En relación al tipo de microhábitat, se determinó un efecto significativo sobre la sobrevivencia de plantas de olivillo y petrillo. Sin embargo, el desarrollo inicial en altura y diámetro de cuello no estuvo afectado por el tipo de sitio. La comparación entre los microhábitat de borde y los de claro abierto, en cuanto a sobrevivencia, no mostró diferencia entre ellos. Esto podría deberse a que ambos recibían en forma similar el efecto directo de las neblinas. Sin embargo, éstos mostraron diferencias significativas con respecto a los claros cerrados.

La diferencia entre los microhábitats puede deberse a que los claros cerrados, contrariamente a los bordes y claros abiertos, no reciben efecto directo de las neblinas porque éstas son interceptadas por la vegetación arbórea que circunda el claro, disminuyendo su efecto en el área de claro. Esto se traduce en una disminución de la humedad relativa y en un aumento de la temperatura, aspectos negativos en el área de estudio, para la sobrevivencia de las plantas. A su vez, al reducirse la densidad del dosel ocurren flujos altos de temperaturas del aire dentro del bosque, lo que afecta a la vegetación.
Los resultados obtenidos con las plantaciones de olivillo y petrillo en Fray Jorge fueron muy promisorios y permiten diseñar plantaciones de enriquecimiento de mayor extensión. En canelo, no obstante el menor número de ejemplares utilizados, se puede señalar que se pueden obtener también buenos resultados plantando ejemplares vigorosos y con buen desarrollo, en los microhábitats adecuados.
En el ensayo en que se compararon las especies olivillo y petrillo, de uno y dos años en vivero, realizado en claro abierto sin riego, se estableció que olivillo con dos años de vida presentó los mejores resultados en sobrevivencia y crecimiento, seguido por olivillo de un año. Se concluyó que el uso de ejemplares con dos años de permanencia en vivero, bien lignificados, aumenta significativamente la sobrevivencia de olivillo, petrillo y canelo en plantaciones. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/ecuador-reforestation-with-native-species-in-the-southern-andean-region/	Ecuador: Reforestation with Native Species in the Southern Andean Region	Ecuador	2003-05-01	2005-05-01	"In spite of its designation as one of the world’s biodiversity “hot spots,” Ecuador has the highest deforestation rate in South America. Large tracts of its Andean forests have been exploited for timber and non-timber forest products and then converted into agricultural systems, primarily pastures for livestock production. These pastures decrease in productivity relatively quickly and must eventually be abandoned, leaving a denuded site overgrown with non-native grasses. Due to the region’s harsh environmental conditions, natural forest succession at these sites proceeds very slowly, making reforestation initiatives a growing necessity in recent years. At present, approximately 90% of these initiatives have employed fast growing non-native species–mainly pine (Pinus radiata and Pinus patula) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus saligna)–owing to a paucity of knowledge about the silvicultural characteristics and ecology of native species. This study was undertaken to evaluate the performance of a number of native species (both light demanding and shade tolerant) at three sites, representing different successional phases, and to test the efficacy of various methodologies in facilitating their establishment and long-term survival. Another facet of the study involved the plantation of native species within a Pinus patula monoculture to assess the potential for converting these plantations into more natural ecosystems. It is hoped that as a result of this study, restoration measures in Ecuador’s Andean forests will begin to rely more heavily on native species, and thereby improve the region’s overall biodiversity and resilience.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Mining & Resource Extraction The original forest cover of Ecuador is estimated to have covered 90% of the land area, corresponding to about 26 million hectares (Cabarle et al. 1989, Wunder 2000). In 2005, the remaining forest area was only 10.8 million hectares (FAO 2006a) of which only 3.0 million hectares can be classified as “production forests”–which are designated for the production and extraction of forest goods. Apart from deforestation in the pre-Columbian era, the main deforestation processes occurred in the last century, during the cocoa (1920s) and banana boom (1950-1965) in the coastal region (Costa), where large areas of forest were cleared for crop production. Another wave of deforestation was driven by the opening-up of the Oriente by road construction and oil exploitation in the 1970s. However, even today deforestation is continuing at an alarming rate. Over the last several years, Ecuador has faced the highest deforestation rate in South America (1.7 % area year-1) (FAO 2006a). The conversion of forest land into agricultural land–mainly pastures–is the primary cause of the deforestation, especially in the Andean Region.
For the San Francisco Valley, the area under investigation in this study, Paulsch et al. (2001) described the land-use dynamic typical of the montane Andean region. The first step is the exploitation of the primary forests. Following the exploitation, small-scale farmers transform the exploited forests into pastures for cattle ranching. In order to improve the productivity of the pastures, they plant non-native grasses, especially Setaria sphacelata and Melinis minutiflora. As a result of the regular burning of the pastures by the farmers, bracken fern (Pteridium arachnoideum) is invading the areas more and more. After several years, the decreasing productivity of the sites forces farmers to abandon the land and convert a new patch of forest into pastures (see also Hartig & Beck 2003). Due to the harsh environmental conditions on the abandoned sites and the lack of seed input, the natural succession is very slow, and it takes several decades until a forest is recovered. Consequently, there exists an increasing amount of unproductive land, especially over-used, degraded or abandoned pastures. Originally, mountain forests covered most of the Ecuadorian Andean region. The Tropical Mountain Forest (TMF) is characterized by high richness and endemism of arboreal species. It is considered one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world and is named among the global “hot spots” of biodiversity (Brummitt & Lughadha 2003, Richter & Moreira 2005, Bussmann 2006). The diversity of this ecosystem is strongly correlated with elevation; diversity diminishes linearly with increasing altitude from 1.500 m a.s.l. to the forest top limit (Gentry 1995). JÁ¸rgensen & Leon (1999) registered for the Andean region 9865 vascular plant species, which represent 64.4% of the total number of species in Ecuador. Ulloa & JÁ¸rgensen (1995) found 334 trees species and 1.071 shrubs species in zones over 2.400 meters altitude, and Fehse et al. (1999) also registered more than 200 tree species over 2.500 m a.s.l.
The forests at the ECSF are rather specific (Bussmann 2006). They are characterized by a very high variation of small-scale vegetation units. This variation is related to vegetation zoning, steep slopes, and frequent natural landslide occurrences, which cause mosaics of micro-climatic conditions and, consequently, highly variable vegetation units (Becking 2004, Bussmann 2006). According to Neill (1999), the dominant vegetation types in the Andean region are: Lower montane rain forest (LMRF), Cloud forest (CF), North Ecuadorian grassland and quebrada vegetation, South Ecuadorian shrub vegetation, and Páramos.
– The first type is distributed between 700 – 2.500 m a.s.l. on the western and eastern Andean slopes. With nearly constant high atmospheric humidity, frequent fog- and mist-associated precipitation, and dense loads of vascular epiphytes as well as bryophytes on tree branches and trunks.
– The Cloud forest also called “upper montane rain forest” and “ceja andina” (in Spanish) occurs on the high Andean slopes from 2.500 m elevation to the upper limit of closed forest (3.400 – 3.600 m a.s.l.).
– The North Ecuadorian grassland and quebrada vegetation is present in the densely populated inter-Andean valleys, where the original vegetation was removed and replaced by agricultural and pastures.
– The South Ecuadorian shrub vegetation occurs in the inter-Andean valleys of south Ecuador between 2.000 – 3.000 m elevation.
– The Páramo vegetation is distributed through the Ecuadorian Andes from about 3.400 (in the North region) to 2.800 (in the South region). To improve basic knowledge of the silvicultural properties of selected native tree species and evaluate their capability for reforestation of abandoned lands.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: For the investigations conducted under this project, four different sites have been selected:
1. A pasture currently used for livestock rearing (hereafter: pasture)
2. A recently abandoned pasture covered by the weed Pteridium arachnoideum (hereafter: fern)
3. An abandoned pasture where a young secondary forest with bushy vegetation has become established (hereafter: shrub)
4. A 20-year-old pine (Pinus patula) plantation with a density of 400 individuals per hectare

REFORESTATION EXPERIMENT
Five native species were the primary focus of project activities. Two of these species (Alnus acuminata and Heliocarpus americanus) can be classified as light demanding species since they naturally regenerate (especially in clearances); while the other three species (Cedrela cf montana, Juglans neotropica and Tabebuia chrysantha) are defined as shade tolerant species due to their preference to regenerate under a closed canopy. These native species were planted in pure and mixed plantations.

Because no seeds or seedlings of the selected species were available in the local nurseries, all plants for the reforestation had to be produced within the project, including the exploration of the seed sources, the collection and germination of the seeds, and the production of seedlings in containers. This work was done in the nursery of the project in cooperation with the Forest Engineering Career of Loja National University. The nursery is located in Loja city at 2.100 meters a.s.l and with a mean annual temperature of 15Â°C, which corresponds closely to the conditions at the designated planting sites. 

The seedlings for the plantations on the experimental sites were grown in 560 cm3 Polyethylene containers with a substrate that consisted of a mixture of highland black soil, bed sand, and forest humus at a relation of 2:1:1.

The main field experiment was established as a Generalised Randomised Block Factorial Design (GRBFD) with three successional phases, two treatments (management variations), nine different tree species, and eight repetitions. In total 432 plots (10.8 x 10.8 m each) were established, 144 per successional phase. On each plot, 25 seedlings were planted in pure or mixed species sets with a spacing of 1.8 x 1.8 meters. The planting in the field was performed between May and September 2003 and was realized manually by means of metal bars, making a 30x30x30 cm hole. Immediately before planting, the herbaceous ground vegetation was manually eliminated on all plots. The shrubs and woody vegetation were not removed.

Although forest plantations in the Ecuadorian Sierra have been generally established with a spacing of 3 x 3 m (van Voss et al. 2001), this study employed a spacing of 1.8 x 1.8 m. This allowed a reduction in the size of the plots, and thus facilitated more homogenous conditions within the plots. Furthermore, because canopy cover and canopy density are considered to be the most important factors for encouraging soil stabilization and vegetation recruitment in the understorey (Montagnini & Sancho, 1990, Fisher 1995, Jones et al. 2004), the closer spacing will result in earlier crown closure and intensified competition between the trees and the ground vegetation. It will also create more dynamic interactions among the different tree species in the mixed plots.

To analyze the development of the plants and the influence of the environmental factors, five measurements were performed during the first 24 months: one immediately after planting and then every 6 months. Measurements included such indicators as survival, total height, root collar diameter, number of complete leaves, etc. Soil samples were also collected to facilitate an analysis of environmental variables influencing seedling development. In the collection of these samples, parameters such as altitude, mean inclination, rock cover, and physical soil characteristics were determined.

HERBICIDE EXPERIMENT
For a more detailed analysis of the competitive effects of ground vegetation on the early development of seedlings in abandoned pastures, three sites in the pasture area of the restoration experiment not used for reforestation were selected to establish three blocks of an herbicide experiment. Each plot has been planted with five seedlings of the two native forest species Tabebuia chrysantha and Cedrela montana in pure plantations with a spacing of 1 x 1 m. Consequently, each species is represented by 45 individuals per block and 135 in total. The treatments used in the experiment were:
a. Control: removal of the ground vegetation one time before planting.
b. Mechanical: manual removal before planting and every 4 months after planting.
c. Chemical: removal of ground vegetation by means of a systemic herbicide, (Glifopac, 480 g per liter) 8 days before planting with no further treatment after planting.
The seedlings were produced in the project nursery and planted in November 2004. For the analysis of the treatment effects, three measurements were performed during the first 12 months: one immediately after planting, and subsequent measurements 6 and 12 months after planting.

ENRICHMENT EXPERIMENT
To investigate the potential of native species for enrichment planting in exotic plantations, a further experiment was established in a 20-year-old Pinus patula plantation adjacent to the pasture site of the reforestation experiment (Aguirre et al. 2006). On eight plots, 648 individuals from nine native species were planted in subplots of 16 m2 each under two different environmental conditions: 4 plots under the closed canopy of the pine plantation and 4 plots in small gaps. The species tested were: Alnus acuminata, Cedrela montana, Cinchona officinalis, Cupania cf americana, Heliocarpus americanus, Isertia laevis, Myrica pubescens, Piptocoma discolor and Tabebuia chrysantha. The enrichment planting was done in May 2004. As with the other experiments, ground vegetation was removed manually before planting and every 4 months after planting over a period of 24 months. Four inventories of the seedlings were performed during the first 24 months: one immediately after planting to document the initial situation followed by further inventories after 6, 12 and 24 months. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: REFORESTATION
In surveys conducted to assess vegetative succession at the project sites, the number of seedlings increased according to the successional phase--from about 38.000 individuals per hectare in the pasture samples to more than 430.000 in the forest samples. In total the seedlings germinated in the greenhouse comprised 15 species from 15 genera and 10 families. The dominant families were Asteraceae and Melastomataceae, which contributed 40% of all species. Only two species (Brachyotum and Rubus) could be identified at all three sites of the reforestation experiment. As expected, the proportion of tree species was highest in the forest samples (98%). In the samples from the pasture, 18.000 individuals per hectare could be observed, but all of them were from only one species: H. americanus. Likewise, in the fern samples, 10.000 tree seedlings of Miconia sp. were produced, while in the shrub samples 37.000 trees per hectare, representing 5 different species, successfully germinated. In the forest samples, all seedlings were trees except those from Meriana sp., which contributed 2% of the total number of seedlings. It is surprising that despite the high number of Heliocarpus seedlings for the pasture and the forest, no individual could be found in the fern and the shrub samples.

In order to compare the development of the reforestation with the process of natural succession, the structure, composition and dynamic of the tree and shrub communities was monitored on control plots at all sites. At the shrub site about 6.000 individuals were already present at the beginning of the observation period; at the fern site 2.000 individuals were present. At the shrub site, 64% of those (3752 individuals) were tree species and 35% (2136 individuals) shrubs. At the pasture site, almost no woody plants were present at the beginning; 96% of the individuals found were shrubs and 4% trees. Recruitment showed a decreasing gradient from the shrub to the pastures site. During the observation period of 24 months, more than 6000 individuals (2857 trees, 3725 shrubs) became established at the shrub site and more than 2000 at the fern site. Even at the pasture, a recruitment of 18 trees and 1788 shrubs could be registered. However, mortality was high at the pasture site compared to the fern site. 

At the end of the observation period, a total of 49 species from 44 genera and 29 families were present. The dominant three families were Asteraceae, Melastomataceae and Ericaceae, representing 34% of all species and 31% of the observed genera. At the shrub site, 90% of all species included were represented at the last measurement. At the fern site, 39% of the species were represented, and at the pasture only 35%. It is also important that at the shrub site, 47% of the species were trees compared to only 8% at the pasture and 16% at the fern site. However, mortality was also highest at this site which means that many individuals can establish but are not able to survive for a long period of time due to the strong competition. Myrsine andina was present at all sites, but at the shrub site, density was much higher than at both others sites. Nectandra sp. showed good recruitment (43 ind. Ha-1) at the fern and shrub sites but none at the pasture. No mortality appeared at either site, and the mean height of this species was already 168 cm at the fern site and 226 cm at the shrub site. Other species, such as Tabebuia chrysantha, Clethra revoluta, Hyeronima moritziana and Inga acreana, had densities of 87 ind. Ha-1 at the shrub site, but no new recruitment could be observed during the observation period. Piptocoma discolor could only establish at the pasture and fern sites but not at the shrub site. There were tree species, e.g. Alchornea pearcei and Myrica pubescens, that could establish for a short time but then suffered high mortality, leaving no seedlings at the end of the observation.

There are huge differences in the survival rate among the species after 2 years of natural regeneration. Survival of the exotics species was 92%, and there was no significant difference between E. saligna and P. patula. However, the survival of the native shade tolerant T. chrysantha (94%) was even a bit higher. Surprisingly, the survival of the two light demanding species was significantly lower (57%) than that of all other species (except J. neotropica with 44%), and there was no significant difference between A. acuminata and H. americanus.

On the predominant majority of the plots, more than 5 individuals survived the first two years. Even for the species with high mortality (e.g. H. americanus and J. neotropica), there were only a few plots where less than two individuals survived. If it is assumed that for a full stocking in the final stand, only 100 to 200 individuals per hectare are needed, the long-term survival of only one or two individuals per plot could be sufficient. Moreover, common experience has shown that the surviving trees will be the most vital and competitive individuals. In fact, for all species the maximum height was more than 45% higher than the mean height. For A. acuminata, T. chrysantha and P. patula, the mean height of the highest plants was more than 80% higher than the total mean height. These three species--T. chrysantha, E. saligna and P. patula--showed the highest rates of survival at all three sites.

Survival of all species was lowest on the pasture, with the exception of A. acuminata and J. neotropica, which had the lowest survival on the fern and shrub sites respectively. Almost all species showed the best height results on the pasture site, even though the differences are very small for some species. Results for root collar diameter were similar to height, and only J. neotropica had the lowest RCD on the pasture. 

For all analysed parameters, significant differences between the pasture site and the two other sites could be found, while differences between the fern and shrub sites were not significant except for RCD. Survival of the light demanding and exotic species increased with advanced successional level of the site. Only for the shade tolerant species did conditions seem to be best at the fern site. In contrast to survival, the height of all three groups decreased with advanced succession. Surprisingly, survival of the shade tolerant species at the pasture was significantly higher than that of the light demanding species. The light demanding species had better survival at the shrub site compared to the pasture. However, this can be explained by the low survival of H. americanus on the pasture, which was significantly lower than that of A. acuminata. With regard to height and RCD, the exotics showed significantly higher means than the native species, and the shade tolerant species significantly lower than the light demanding species.

At the pasture site, survival of all tree groups (except the exotics) was higher during the first six months of development compared to the other sites, but then started to rapidly decrease. At the fern and shrub site, survival was a bit lower in the first year but did not decrease tremendously during in the time that followed. Shade tolerant species were superior to the light demanding at all sites, although there were also huge differences among the various species.

The growth characteristics among the successional phases did not differ significantly within the 1st year, but in the 2nd, the development at the pasture became increasingly better than at the other two sites. Comparing the growth performance of the different tree groups, the shade tolerant group showed the lowest growth. The light demanding H. americanus was at the same level as the shade tolerant species, but this was compensated for by the excellent growth of A. acuminata. The shade tolerant J. neotropica even showed a reduction in mean height during the first year because many seedlings experienced a die-back of the shoots. Within the exotics, it is notable that the growth of P. patula showed a strong increase after the first year. It is also remarkable that the development of the RCD of the light demanding species at the pasture site was better than that of the exotics at the fern and shrub sites.

All species except the two exotics showed better rates of survival on the plots with treatment. However, this effect was significant only for the light demanding species A. acuminata and H. americanus. This is surprising, as they were expected to cope best with the pre-existing situation at the sites. While RCD of all species was positively influenced by the treatment, the effect on height varied among the species. C. montana, J. neotropica and E. saligna showed better heights on the untreated plots, while all other species grew better with treatment. Considering all species monitored by the project, neither rates of survival and nor height were significantly affected by the treatment. A similar conclusion could be drawn for RCD among all groups. Here, the differences between the treated and untreated plots also started to increase only after 12 months. The height of the shade tolerant trees was more or less stagnant during the first 18 months, independent of the treatment. 

With regard to pure vs. mixed plantations, no significant effects of mixture on seedling performance could be recognized after two years. These results are not astonishing, as the wide spacing (1.8 x 1.8 m) employed, together with the slow growth of the plants, means that interactions among the species are still very limited. However, mixture effects are expected with the closure of the crowns or when the roots start to interact directly or indirectly in the soil. That being said, significant differences between the pure and mixed plots could be identified for J. neotropica, where all parameters were worse in the mixture. A. acuminata had a significantly lower rate of survival on the pure plots, and C. montana was significantly higher on the mixture. 

A different effect of the successional phase on the pure and mixed plots could be identified for the survival of C. montana and H. americanus, where the pasture showed the lowest survival compared with the fern and shrub sites. Only for J. neotropica was survival at the fern site significantly different from that at the pasture and shrub sites. Also, height and RCD of J. neotropica and A. acuminata showed differences between sites, where the fern led to significant reductions in the mixed plots. In contrast to the pure plots, the treatment had a significant effect on all parameters of H. americanus on the mixed plots, with better survival and growth under the treatment. C. montana and J. neotropica showed better growth in height, and A. acuminata and J. neotropica in RCD, on the treated plots.

MICRO-SITE CONDITIONS
Although there exists no single parameter that is correlated with the growth of all species, rooting depth and the water capacity of the soil seem to be the major influencing factors in seedling performance. Soil texture is another important factor, as was inclination. Indeed, inclination had negative significant correlations with the growth of H. americanus, J. neotropica, T. chrysantha and E. saligna. Even though the altitude had a small variation range of only 340 m (between 1860  -  2200), it showed a negative correlation with the height of A. acuminata, C. montana, J. neotropica, and of both exotic species as well. Shrub cover showed a positive correlation with one shade tolerant species (T. chrysantha), while with A. acuminata it showed negative correlation. In addition, the growth of C. montana, J. neotropica, E. saligna and P. patula was correlated with the rooting depth of the soil, and J. neotropica showed a positive correlation with available water capacity (AWC). Positive correlations of pH were observed with both species exhibiting the best growth rates--A. acuminata and P. patula.

HERBICIDE EXPERIMENT
In the reforestation experiment, the manual removal of ground vegetation did not show a clear significant effect on the growth of the seedlings. A side experiment with C. montana and T. chrysantha seedlings was established to investigate the effects of a chemical treatment as an alternative to the manual clearing. This experiment also considered the biomass production of the ground vegetation and the seedlings. Similar to the reforestation experiment, C. montana had a higher mortality than T. chrysantha, but survival of the seedlings of both species was very high without a significant influence evident from the treatment. In contrast, height and RCD were significantly higher under the chemical treatment, while there was no difference between the control and the manual treatment.

The analyses of the above- and belowground biomass of the ground vegetation and the seedlings conducted in this experiment allow much better insight into the competitive effects between these components. Both treatments led to a reduction in the biomass of the ground vegetation; however, the effect was predominantly concentrated on the aboveground biomass and the belowground biomass between 0 and 7.5 cm depth. Only in the manually treated T. chrysantha plots was the biomass reduction in the category 7.5 - 15 cm of depth higher than in the category 0 - 7.5 cm. In the chemically treated plots under this species, the aboveground biomass of the ground vegetation was also higher than in the manually treated plots. The roots of both tree species were able to penetrate the root tomentum of the ground vegetation and colonize deeper soil, even if their biomass proportion was still low. If the mean height of the plants is considered, the extension of the root system is astonishing. For instance, with a mean height of 51 cm on the chemical plots for T. chrysantha, the vertical extension of the roots was already about 80 cm, and the roots reached a depth of 60 cm. In contrast to the chemical treatment, the total biomass of the trees did not show a significant reaction to the manual treatment. It is interesting to note that of the total biomass on plots treated manually, the proportion of the tree biomass increased from 0.9% (control), 3.5% (manual) to 26.5% for T. chrysantha and 1.0%, 1.1% and 16.4% respectively for C. Montana--although the biomass of ground vegetation in the chemically treated plots was only slightly lower than in the manually treated.

Besides the effects on the biomass, the different treatments also had an effect on the structure and floristic composition of the ground vegetation. After one year in the plots without chemical treatment, the floristic composition of the ground vegetation was still dominated by the pasture grasses Setaria sphacelata and Melinis minutiflora. On the chemical plots, however, S. sphacelata was eliminated and substituted by native grasses and other plants. In fact, vegetation height was reduced at the treated plots by >30% compared to the control plots, but coverage was reduced only at the T. chrysantha plots. Under C. Montana, coverage was even higher at the treated plots.

ENRICHMENT EXPERIMENT
Seedlings of native species were planted under the shelter and in the gaps of a pine plantation to assess the potential for transforming these plantations into more natural ecosystems. Two years after planting, the overall survival was not significantly different among the micro-sites. However, survival of the light demanding species was actually better under the closed canopy (except for A. acuminata and P. discolor), while that of the shade tolerant C. montana and C. officinalis was better in the gaps. C. officinalis experienced high mortality under both conditions. Interestingly, no mortality at all could be observed in the gaps within the first 6 months; while under the canopy, P. discolor, C. officinalis and H. americanus experienced losses of 11 %, 19 %, and 3 % respectively during this time. Mortality continued constantly until the end of the observation period, but survival remained relatively stable in the gaps (except for I. laevis). When the survival in this enrichment planting is compared to that in the reforestation experiment, the situation in the gaps was superior for the corresponding seedlings at all three successional sites. 

With regard to the development of the height and root collar diameter of the species, it is obvious that both parameters were better in the gaps. A. acuminata and P. discolor, in particular, showed excellent growth and reached mean heights of 234 cm and 165 cm respectively, which is more than 2.5 times that of the plants under the canopy and 1.6 times of those in the reforestation experiment.

Looking at the height/RCD ratio, it is interesting that many species had higher values under the canopy. Only C. cf americana and C. montana had clearly higher values in the gap. These species had a very low increment in RCD compared to the canopy. T. chrysantha also exhibited a slightly increased ratio under the canopy, but its RCD increment of 1.1 cm was similar to that of the light demanding species.

All species except C. cf americana and C. montana already stand more than 1 meter in height, and the talles trees are more than 3 m tall. For most species, the relation between the height in the gap and under the canopy increased; only for I. laevis and T. chrysantha did the relation decreased slightly. In addition, the variation of the growth parameters under the canopy was clearly lower compared to the gap. Thus, under the canopy, the growth was more homogenous. In addition to the growth parameters, the surviving seedlings of all species also showed a better health status in the gap. This is not only true for the light demanding species, but also for the shade tolerant species. The shade tolerant C. montana, for example, obviously preferred the gap condition because under the canopy 25% of the plants were of poor health. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The results obtained for the native species show that the micro-site conditions apparently play a fundamental role in the performance of a given species.

A. acuminata has the reputation of having a strong ability to adapt to and grow well under a wide range of environmental conditions (Dunn et al. 1990, Lamprecht 1990, Añazco 1996, Fournier 2002). However, in this study, a survival of only 58% was observed. This low rate of survival was related to the water availability and soil compaction because at a humid site without soil compaction near Oyacachi, Ecuador at 2000 m elevation, Fehse et al. (2002) registered very high colonization rates of A. acuminata (>20.000 individuals per hectare) within the first two years after a natural landslide. Apart from the relatively high mortality, though, the surviving seedlings of A. acuminata in this study exhibited excellent performance. They showed the best growth and were only surpassed by the seedlings of P. patula.

The light demanding species H. americanus was expected to exhibit good adaptability to conditions at the reforestation plots, especially on the pasture, since in reforestations on abandoned land in the Amazonian region of Ecuador, this species showed high survival rates (90%) and excellent growth in height (1 meter per year) (Davidson et al. 1998). However, those sites were at a lower altitude (1300 m a.s.l.) and exhibited more humidity (3000 mm/year) and warmer temperatures (mean temperature 22Â°C). In this study, the behaviour of H. americanus was disappointing, as its survival rate was only 53% and its growth performance was low. It is concluded that this species has clear preferences for certain micro-sites (niches). For instance, in the three plots with drainage problems, the seedlings experienced a mortality of 100%. Nitrogen availability could also help explain the bad performance, as Rhoades et al. (1998) report that the nitrogen availability within pastures with Setaria sphacelata was reduced by 20% compared to the soil of natural montane forest. This conclusion is supported by the fact that in the current study, at one plot with a comparatively good nutritional status (due to natural fertilization by cattle dung), the total mean in height was 187 meters, which was quite similar to the growth registered in the natural forest of the ECSF close to a creek where Cabrera (pers. comm.) registered a height growth of 2 meters per year. These findings are also in line with the common experience of the local foresters that H. americanus has a preference for sites with good drainage and constant humidity.

Surprisingly, the shade tolerant native species T. chrysantha showed the best survival (94%) of all species. This demonstrates its ability to establish in degraded areas under very heterogeneous conditions. Otsamo et al. (1997) also reported good survival rates in plantations with T. chrysantha in Indonesia at sites with a precipitation of 2128 mm per year and a dry period of 5 months. The high survival of this species may be explained by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizas in the roots. A corresponding sampling of the seedlings at the pasture site revealed that all roots of T. chrysantha contained abundant arbuscular mycorrhizas (Huag pers. comm.). This is a result of the fact that for the production of the seedlings in the nursery, a substrate was used with soil from the natural forest containing ample mycorrhizas, which inoculated the roots of the seedlings (Kottke et al. in press). However, in contrast to the excellent survival, the growth of the seedlings was quite modest, which is also in line with the results of Otsamo. This modest growth performance is likely due to strong root competition with the ground vegetation because in the herbicide experiment, the chemical elimination of the root competition improved the growth of C. montana and T. chrysantha significantly.

The behaviour of J. neotropica was characterized by its minimal survival and poor growth. This stands in contrast with the good development of the species reported from plantations in New Zealand using seed provenient from Ecuador (National Research Council 1989). In fact, in New Zealand, the trees exhibited a growth rate of up to 1.5 m/year (at 10 years of age the plants were 10 meters tall). For the species J. piriformis, Pedraza & Williams-Linera (2003) reported survival rates of 76% on abandoned pastures in Veracruz, Mexico. Due to the excellent behaviour of Juglans in their observations, and despite its poor performance here, Juglans is still recommended for rehabilitation of degraded soil. The poor performance of the seedlings at the ECSF could be related to the superficial depth of soil and the deficient drainage properties. Indeed, from studies in Costa Rica it is known that Juglans requires optimal soil and water availability for good performance (CATIE 1997, Nieto & Rodriguez 2002b).

The opposed trends of increasing survival but decreasing growth between the pasture site and the fern and the shrub sites in this study can be explained by the different floristic composition of the vegetation at the sites (Flick 2003) on the one hand, and the differences in the light exposure and humidity conditions in soil and air on the other. At the pasture, competition was predominantly determined by the Setaria grass. However, due to the removal of ground vegetation before planting, competition during the observation period was primarily dominated by the belowground effects. Consequently, the low survival of A. acuminata, H. americanus and J. neotropica at the pasture site may be related to reduced soil humidity resulting from compaction due to recent grazing. Another critical soil factor may have been the nitrogen availability. As already mentioned, Rhoades et al. (1998) reported that the nitrogen availability in pastures with Setaria sphacelata was reduced by 20% compared to that in the natural forest. This fact would also explain the strong performance of the N-fixing A. acuminata in this study.

The finding that surviving seedlings at the pasture site showed better growth than those at the fern and shrub sites can be explained by the higher solar radiation at the open pasture compared to both other sites. As is known from many studies, plants are able to adapt their photosynthesis to high radiation (e.g. Lichtenthaler 1996, Larcher 2003). Thus, immediately after planting, photoinhibition may even have contributed to the higher mortality at the pasture, but the surviving seedlings seem to have subsequently adapted to the high insolation.

At the fern site, the lower growth rate of the seedlings could be related to the direct competitive effect of the invasive Pteridium (in addition to the aforementioned shade effect) (Shepherd 1986, Hartig & Beck 2003, Roos 2004, Rodriguez Da Silva & Da Silva Matos 2006). Its competitive strength results from deep rhizomes that reach depths of one meter and enable the plant to survive under adverse conditions. Furthermore, this dense network of roots releases allelopathic substances that inhibit the natural regeneration and growth of native forest species (Ferguson et al. 2005, Rodriguez Da Silva & Da Silva Matos 2006, Slocum et al. 2006).

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The Andean tropical mountain forests are of great global, regional, and local importance for the provision of environmental services (Sarmiento 2001, Lojan 2003, Bussmann 2006). They capture and store rainfall and humidity, maintain water quality, reduce erosion, and provide protection against landslides, avalanches, and floods (Sarmiento 2001, Lojan 2003). In developing countries like Ecuador, the loss of land productivity is particularly disastrous because forestry and agricultural land use is one of the main generators of income, especially in rural areas.
The afforestation practice in the Andes of Ecuador is still almost completely based on the use of exotic species (e.g. Pinus patula, P. radiata, Eucalyptus globulus, E. saligna and Cupressus lusitanica), while native species are merely used for agroforestry or at an experimental scale. The widespread use of exotic tree species is mainly a result of extensive knowledge about their silvicultural characteristics, the fast growth rates they exhibit, and their industrial utility. However, these exotic species have also been favored because of a lack of corresponding knowledge about the native species. The study described herein allows a direct comparison which will enable practitioners to balance the ecological, economic and socio-economic advantages and disadvantages of both groups in the long run.
In the reforestation experiment conducted as part of the project, the performance of the exotics during the first two years after plantation was better than that of most natives. That being said, T. chrysantha exhibited a higher rate of survival than both exotics, and the growth of A. acuminata was significantly superior to that of E. saligna and only slightly inferior to that of P. patula. These observations suggest that natives are able to compete with exotic species when species-specific characteristics and appropriate site conditions are carefully considered. For Ecuador, with its tremendous diversity of 2736 native tree species (JÁ¸rgensen & León Yanez 1999), and more than 200 species in areas above 2500 m a.s.l. (Fehse et al. 1999), it can be assumed that species for all types of conditions are available. However, there is a huge need for more experiences and investigations. "

Através de cambios hidrológicos iniciados en 1995 con la apertura de cinco canales naturales pre-existentes que comunican el agua dulce del río Magdalena con el sistema lagunar, se trata de una reducción significativa de la salinidad de la columna de agua y del agua intersticial del suelo para facilitar la regeneración natural de los manglares. Al ser modificada la hidrología, y reducida la salinidad, se observó una ganacia neta del bosque de manglar de 99 km2 entre 1995 y 1999. La alta precipitación registrada en los años 1995 y 1999 como resultado del fenómeno El Niño-La Niña (ENSO), y coincidente con la apertura de los caños, influyó significativamente en la rápida regeneración de los manglares. Aunque el proyecto haya demonstrado la respuesta inmediata del ecosistema a cambios hidrológicos a una escala espacial y temporal, y el beneficio potencial de este tipo de proyectos en otras regiones de Latino América, el mantenimiento de las obras hidráulicas a partir de 2001 ha sido irregular, debido a la falta de inversión económica por el Gobierno Colombiano y sus colaboradores internacionales, y se ha observado un incremento gradual de la salinidad y el deterioro de la vegetación regenerada.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Las principales causas del deterioro ambiental en la región son las siguientes:
–Interrupción del intercambio hídrico entre el complejo lagunar de la Ciénaga Grande y el mar debido a la construcción en el año 1956 de la carretera Ciénaga-Barranquilla que no previó en su momento las medidas necesarias para mantener los flujos naturales entre el mar y la CGSM.
–Disminución de entrada de agua dulce proveniente del río Magdalena al complejo, originada por la sedimentación y taponamiento de los canales debido a procesos naturales, aunado al incremento de acarreo de limos en suspensión por el caudal del río Magdalena, que evidencia procesos erosivos en su cuenca y que alcanzan las 133 millones de ton/año, las cuales un gran porcentaje de este volumen se depositan en los caños que alimentan a la CGSM.
–Construcción del carreteable Medialuna-Pivijay-Salamina, que afectó los caños Ciego y Salado, junto con la construcción del carreteable Palermo-Sitionuevo han sido, otro factor que ha influido en la disminución del flujo de agua dulce al complejo, debido a que las obras de drenaje construidas para permitir el paso del agua no tienen en algunos casos las especificaciones técnicas requeridas y otras han facilitado la acción de taponamiento de las entradas de agua, por parte de los propietarios de predios de la zona.
–La contaminación del recurso hídrico, como consecuencia del vertimiento de las aguas domesticas sin ningún tratamiento previo a la Ciénaga Grande y el arrojo indiscriminado de los residuos provenientes de las actividades agroindustriales desarrolladas en la zona bananera.
–El deterioro de las cuencas hidrográficas de los ríos que desembocan en la Ciénaga y la sobreexplotación del acuífero en la zona bananera, han ocasionado que estos ríos aporten menores cantidades de agua dulce y mayores cantidades de sedimentos.
Como resultado de todos estos factores, se ha observado la mortalidad masiva (246.24 km2 en 43 años – 1956-1999) de una amplia extensión (511.5 km2 en 1956) de bosques de manglar. El delta-estuario del río Magdalena constituye una de las áreas más extensas (400.000 ha.), complejas y diversas de la costa norte colombiana, por incluir: extensas zonas cubiertas por manglares (compuestos de Rhizophora mangle [mangle rojo], Avicennia germinans [mangle salado], Laguncularia racemosa [mangle amarillo] y Conocarpus erecta [mangle zaragoza o bobo]), bosques ribereños y bosques xerofíticos, así como una compleja gama de comunidades de pantano de agua dulce, que en conjunto albergan una gran diversidad de especies de anfibios, reptiles, aves y mamíferos.
Debido a su importancia ecológica, económica y social, la zona ha sido seleccionada para integrar la Lista de Humedales de Importancia Internacional (Decreto 224 de febrero 2 de 1998) en cumplimiento de lo dispuesto por la Ley 357 de enero 21 de 1997 a través de la cual Colombia aprobó la Convención Relativa a los Humedales de Importancia Internacional especialmente como Hábitat de Aves Acuáticas suscrita en Ramsar (Irán, febrero 2 de 1971). Así mismo, el Consejo Internacional de Coordinación del Programa sobre el Hombre y la Biosfera de la UNESCO, en su reunión del 10 de diciembre del 2000, aprobó la nominación de la Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta, como una de las 391 reservas de la biosfera en 94 países, con todas las ventajas y responsabilidades que estas designaciones implican (UNESCO, 2001). La principal acción del proyecto ha sido la modificación de la hidrología a nivel regional para promover la disminución de la salinidad de los suelos de manglar, y facilitar la regeneración natural de los bosques de manglar–esto último con el objeto de crear hábitats para la recuperación de las pesquerías artesanales y comerciales de importancia económica para la región.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: El proyecto de rehabilitación consistió en la apertura de cinco canales naturales pre-existentes: El Clarín,
Almendros, El Torno, Alimentador, Renegado, y Aguas Negras, los cuales se encontraban sedimentados, conduciendo un máximo estimado de 150 m3/s de flujo de agua dulce proveniente del Río Magdalena. De estos canales El Clarín, Aguas Negras, y Renegado (caudal de diseño total: 140 m3/s) tienen un efecto directo en áreas con una alta mortalidad de manglares debido al lavado de los suelos de manglar y por ende la disminución en la salinidad del suelo. El flujo de agua a través de estos tres canales está controlado por compuertas a excepción de El Clarín. La fase de construcción de las obras hidráulicas terminó en 1998.

Para un análisis histórico y contemporáneo de los cambios en la salinidad de los suelos y estructura de los bosques de manglar, antes y después de la rehabilitación hidrológica, se seleccionaron estaciones de muestreo donde se colectaron datos antes de la apertura de los caños a lo largo de un gradiente de perturbación desde 1994 (Giraldo 1995, Serrano-Díaz 1995, Perdomo 1996, Cardona y Botero 1998, Castañeda 1998, Casas 1999). El gradiente de perturbación está basado en el enfoque de ""substitución de tiempo por espacio"" (Pickett 1987, Aronson et al. 1995) seleccionando sitios con una estructura de la vegetación y grado de perturbación (régimen de salinidad e inundación) representados por diferentes estadios de deterioro. Los puntos extremos del gradiente son dos sitios de referencia no perturbados que incluyen bosques de manglar con buen desarrollo estructural localizados en la parte oeste de la Isla de Salamanca y relativamente próximo al Río Magdalena (El Torno, TOR) y adyacente a la boca del Caño Clarín (Rinconada, RIN). Ambas estaciones presentan un bosque en buen estado de desarrollo constituido por árboles de Avicennia germinans, Laguncularia racemosa y Rhizophora mangle pertenecientes al tipo fisiográfico de cuenca (Lugo y Snedaker 1974) con alturas máximas entre 15- 20 m (Cardona y Botero 1998, Castañeda 1998).

En el otro extremo se seleccionaron dos sitios totalmente perturbados donde ocurrieron mortalidades masivas de árboles de manglar como resultado del incremento de la salinidad del agua intersticial de suelo (>70 g kg-1) (La Luna y Bristol) (Cardona y Botero 1998). Bristol (BIS) se encuentra en el sector norte del complejo de Pajarales CP sobre el Caño Bristol y se caracteriza por un manglar de borde (5-10 m de ancho) constituido por árboles de A. germinans y en menor proporción de L. racemosa, así como plántulas de estas dos especies. En el interior se observan troncos en pie de árboles muertos de ambas especies, y aproximadamente a 100 m de la orilla del canal se observan los troncos en pie de árboles grandes muertos de A. germinans ( >20 cm DAP  -  diámetro a la altura del pecho). La dimensión de estos árboles indica que en esta área se encontraba un bosque bien desarrollado previo a la mortalidad masiva. La Luna (LUN), ubicada en la parte central del CP, es un sitio con el máximo estado de perturbación. Se presentan troncos muertos en pie de A. germinans y de L. racemosa. También se seleccionaron cuatro sitos intermedios (KM22, KM13, Caño Grande, Aguas Negras) a lo largo del gradiente de perturbación. Los sitios KM22 y KM13 están localizados a lo largo del Caño Clarín (32 km en extensión) donde la entrada de agua dulce comenzó a partir de 1996 promoviendo la recuperación de manglares en áreas adyacentes al caño.

Las muestras de agua intersticial del suelo en estas estaciones se colectaron usando tubos de PVC perforados en la parte inferior e insertándolos en el sedimento hasta 50 cm de profundidad (Schaeffer-Novelli y Cintrón 1986). La salinidad se midio con un salinómetro portátil (model 30, YSI Incorporated, Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA). Las diferencias en salinidad fueron evaluadas usando un análisis de varianza de dos factores (ANOVA) (año, estación). Las diferencias espaciales en la salinidad a 0,5 m de profundidad fueron evaluadas en cuatro estaciones de muestreo (Rinconada, La Luna, Caño Grande, y Aguas Negras) en la época seca mayor y lluvia menor en 1999. En cada estación se llevaron a cabo mediciones de salinidad en cuatro transectos de 100 m (separados cada uno 20 m) donde la salinidad se midió cada 10 metros. Para obtener un mapa de la distribución de la salinidad por cada estación se llevó a cabo un análisis geoestadístico de todos los valores de salinidad por estación de muestreo siguiendo los métodos descritos en Rivera-Monroy et al. (2004).

El área basal se midió siguiendo métodos descritos en Cintrón y Schaeffer-Novelli (1984). Adicionalmente se evaluó la regeneración natural de plántulas (<2,5 cm de diámetro) y juveniles (2,5- 4,5 cm de diámetro) de las diferentes especies de manglar en Rinconada, Aguas Negras, Bristol, y la Luna. En estos sitios el muestreo se realizó a lo largo de dos bandas (2 x 100 m). En cada banda se registraron la distancia de las plántulas con respecto al cuerpo de agua y el número de plántulas por especie; las diferencias entre especies y sitios fueron evaluadas usando un ANOVA de dos factores (estación, especie).

Para evaluar el impacto de los flujos de agua de los caños rehabilitados en los cambios de salinidad de la CGSM propiamente, también se analizaron datos obtenidos en estaciones permanentes establecidas antes de la apertura de los caños (1993-1994). Las estaciones analizadas fueron seleccionadas de acuerdo con su localización en sitos donde el aporte de agua dulce influye en la salinidad de la columna de agua. Las estaciones seleccionadas son: Ciénaga La Redonda, Boca Rinconada, Aguas Negras, Caño Grande, y Centro de la CGSM. La salinidad fué medida a 0,5 m de profundidad usando un salinómetro portátil (model 30, YSI Incorporated, Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: La salinidad a 0,5 m se redujo significativamente de 1994 al 2000 en siete estaciones de muestreo. El cambio más drástico ocurrió en la estación del KM13 donde hasta 1994 la salinidad media anual observada había sido de >90 g kg-1, reduciéndose hasta <10 g kg-1 después de la apertura del Caño Clarín. Esta reducción se observa también en las estaciones KM22 y cerca de la boca del caño Aguas Negras. En esta última estación se aprecia una disminución de >70 a <10 g kg-1. El área que presenta la menor reducción en salinidad es la estación La Luna, donde se redujo aproximadamente en 20 g kg-1 entre 1994 y 2000. La reducción de la salinidad en el suelo está directamente relacionada a la apertura de los caños en diferentes años. Estos cambios también están en estrecha correspondencia con la reducción de salinidad de la columna de agua. La magnitud de la reducción se puede apreciar mejor en la época seca mayor (diciembre-abril), cuando el flujo de agua sobre la superficie disminuye en tres estaciones sujetas a la influencia de los caños El Clarín y Aguas Negras, en relación a la estación de referencia (Rinconada). En ambas estaciones se observa una disminución de hasta 20 g kg-1 por año después de la apertura de los caños. Mas aún, a partir de 1999 la salinidad es menor (<30 g kg-1) a la observada en la estación de referencia, reflejando la alta precipitación ocurrida en 1999. La distribución espacial de la salinidad muestra diferencias significativas dentro de cada estación donde la salinidad tiende a incrementarse hacia el interior de la estación de muestreo. Sin embargo, en la estación de Aguas Negras, localizada en la Ciénaga de Pajarales y aledaño al margen sur del canal Aguas Negras, la salinidad se redujo a los 60-70 m (de 75 g kg-1 en 1994 a 2,5 g kg-1) en relacion al borde del canal debido a la entrada de agua dulce proveniente del río Magdalena y la presencia de depresiones en la topografía que mantuvieron el nivel del agua alto, reduciendo la salinidad en estas áreas. La disminuición en la salinidad del suelo ha permitido el desarrollo de numerosas especies herbáceas y acuáticas flotantes, entre las que se destacan Ipomoea sp, Eichornia sp. Estas especies no estaban presentes antes de la reapertura del canal. Hacia el borde del cuerpo de agua se desarrolla una franja (2-5 m de ancho) de árboles jóvenes de A. germinans y de L. racemosa con una altura máxima de 4,4 m y un promedio de 3,3 m.

Estos resultados indican que la salinidad intersticial en áreas adyacentes a los caños se redujo en un porcentaje mayor al 50% después de un año en que los caños Clarín y Aguas Negras fueron rehabilitados. Similarmente se observa que después de dos años de terminada la reconexión del sistema lagunar marginal (SLM ) con el río Magdalena, todas las áreas que presentaban un grado de perturbación/ deterioro (definido por la mortalidad de los bosques de manglar) muestran valores de salinidad similares al sitio de referencia. También se observa un amplia variación espacial de la salinidad en sitios con altos grado de perturbación (La Luna, Aguas Negras). Sin embargo, los valores observados (5-40 g kg-1) no representan un estrés para el crecimiento de la vegetación de manglar. Es evidente por la alta tasa de cambio de la salinidad que la estructura del suelo (porosidad, textura, etc.) en todas las estaciones, en conjunto con los altos niveles de inundación en el periodo 1999-2000 en toda el área de estudio, contribuyó a la reducción significativa de la salinidad en menos de un año.

Existe una diferencia significativa en la densidad de plántulas y juveniles de las especies de manglar entre la Luna, Caño Bristol, y Aguas Negras (sitios perturbados) y Rinconada (sitio no perturbado). La densidad de plántulas en Rinconada es el doble de la observada en La Luna y Bristol. La especie dominante es L. racemosa la cual se observó creciendo en áreas con mayor elevación del suelo y próximas a pequeños canales en la parte interior del bosque. La segunda especie dominante fue A. germinans, la cual fue encontrada en mayores densidades en Rinconada. En los sitios perturbados A. germinans representó <10% de la densidad total. Aparentemente su baja densidad es el resultado de altos niveles del agua que no permite su establecimiento durante la época de lluvias. La densidad de plántulas de R. mangle fue menor en todos los sitios en comparación con las otras dos especies. Adicionalmente se observa que la herbivoría de propágulos y plántulas de A. germinans por el lepidóptero Junonia evarete durante la época de lluvias posiblemente esté limitando el desarrollo de los propágulos que alcanzan a establecerse en zonas altas (Elster et al. 1999). Estos dos procesos de control (hidrología y herbivoría) tendrán un efecto significativo en la composición de especies de las zonas perturbadas durante el desarrollo del bosque. De igual manera la baja salinidad permite tambien el establecimiento de especies como Thypa sp., la cual compite por espacio y nutrientes afectando negativamente el establecimiento y crecimiento de propagulos de manglar.

La evaluación de los cambios en el área basal de los árboles vivos durante 1995, 1997, y 1999 en Caño Grande, KM22, Aguas Negras, y Bristol, indican que el rango del valor medio de área basal de A. germinans es de 0,1-10,1 m2 ha-1, mientras que para L. racemosa y R. mangle fue de 0 -7,5 y 0,1-7 m2 ha-1, respectivamente. Estos valores contrastan con los valores estimados en los sitios de referencia (Rinconada y El Torno) donde los valores de área basal para A. germinans alcanzan 15 y 30 m2 ha-1. Como resultado de la alta regeneración de L. racemosa a partir de la reducción de la salinidad, se observa un incremento significativo de área basal de esta especie de 1995 a 1999. El mayor valor de área basal corresponde a la estación KM22 la cual está directamente influenciada por el caño Clarín, reabierto en 1996. La ausencia de árboles de R. mangle en las estaciones de Aguas Negras y Bristol indica que las condiciones para el crecimiento de esta especie no son adecuadas todavía (salinidades >60 g kg-1, menor frecuencia de inundación). Aunque R. mangle se encuentra presente en la estación de Rinconada, el área basal promedio (4,5 m2 ha-1 ) es significativamente menor que el de A. germinans (14 m2 ha-1), y en algunas estaciones se observa una disminución pequeña pero significativa de su área basal entre 1995 y 1999 (Caño Grande). Aunque la estación Rinconada y El Torno son consideradas como sitios de referencia, se observan algunas diferencias estructurales importantes. Por ejemplo, en El Torno existe una mayor área basal de la especie R. mangle y un incremento significativo de A. germinans desde 1995. Estas diferencias están asociadas a diferencias en los regímenes hidrológicos y aparentemente a que la estación de Rinconada es un bosque en desarrollo debido a cambios geomorfológicos e hidrológicos locales durante la década de los 70 (Wiedemann 1973).

La reducción de los recursos pesqueros en la RCGSM fue una de las razones económicas y sociales por la que se inició el proyecto de rehabilitación. Los cambios hidrológicos y la hipersalinidad de la columna de agua ( >40 g kg-1 en el Complejo Pajarales) resultaron en cambios drásticos en la composición de los recursos pesqueros de importancia comercial (Botero y Mancera 1996). Especies de peces como el lebranche (Mugil liza) y robalo (Centropomus undecimalis) los cuales tenían un alto valor en el mercado en los años 70 y 80 empezaron a escasear, y otros organismos también de importancia comercial, como el caracol (Melongena melongena) y la ostra (Crassostrea rhizophorae), prácticamente desaparecieron (Botero y Mancera 1996). A partir del proyecto de la apertura de los caños (1995) cuando la salinidad se reduce significativamente en la columna de agua (<10 g kg-1), especies como la Mojarra lora (Oreochromis niloticus), una especie herbívora eurohalina que puede tolerar niveles de oxígeno disuelto hasta de 0,1 ppm y mantener poblaciones en salinidades de 30 g kg-1 (Skelton 1993), empieza a dominar la captura por unidad de esfuerzo en el período 1999 -2000 (INVEMAR 2004). Para el año 2001, la mojarra lora declina y la especie dominante es Mugil incilis (Lisa). Esta dominancia contrasta con la abundancia de las especies estuarinas como Anchovia clupeoides, Eugerres Plumieri, Ariopsis Bonilla, Elops saurus, Cathorops spixii, Micropogonias furnieri, Diapterus rhombeus and Tarpon atlanticus las cuales eran dominantes en período1993-1995 (Sánchez y Rueda 1999, Rueda y Defeo 2003a). La dominancia de la mojarra lora en 1999 indica los profundos cambios en la estructura trófica de las comunidades ícticas del sistema lagunar (Botero y Mancera 1996) y en este momento no es claro cual es la trayectoria en cuanto a la recuperación sustentable de las pesquerías (Rueda y Defeo 2003b). Esta incertidumbre, aunada a la disminución de las tallas mínimas de madurez sexual de algunas especies y a un aumento significativo del esfuerzo pesquero (INVEMAR 2004) ha contribuido a la percepción en las organizaciones sociales que el proyecto de rehabilitación no ha alcanzado lo beneficios ecológicos y sociales propuestos (Rivera-Monroy et al. 2001). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: A pesar de los esfuerzos para recuperar la vegetación y las pesquerías, como en varias regiones costeras en el neotrópico, la Región de la Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta presenta síntomas de un deterioro potencialmente irreversible debido a la falta de un plan de desarrollo económico a largo plazo para la región. Desafortunadamente a partir del 2001, el mantenimiento extensivo de las obras hidráulicas (dragado de los caños) ha sido irregular especialmente en 2002 debido a la falta de recursos económicos. Similarmente, no existe un plan aprobado para el manejo de compuertas de control de flujo y por lo tanto no hay registro de caudales de los caños ni una evaluación de la entrada de sedimentos. Como consecuencia la salinidad ha empezado ha aumentar en suelos y aguas, impactando la vegetacion recuperada, aun en áreas seleccionadas como referencia. El rendimiento pesquero bajó depués del 2000 a niveles similares a los que existían antes de la apertura de los canales, aunque se ha incrementado ligeramente en el 2004 (INVEMAR 2004). Este rendimiento tiene una alta variabilidad inter-anual debido a las condiciones climáticas ya mencionadas. La fluctuacion de los recursos hidrobiológicos ha tenido como consecuencia que los ingresos económicos de los grupos sociales dedicados a la pesca hayan disminuido significativamente. Y debido a la falta de recursos económicos la presencia de agencias gubernamentales también ha disminuido.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: La captura pesquera es la actividad extractiva por excelencia en la región. El valor de la captura a precios de productor se estima en el año 2000 en unos $3,0 millones de dólares incluyendo el autoconsumo de los pescadores. Se estima que el 25-35% de los ingresos corresponden al pescador y que el volumen total de negocios es tres veces mayor que el valor a precios de productor y que estaría en el orden de $10 millones de dólares anuales a precios corrientes.

La comparación entre el escenario anterior (1994-1996) y posterior (1999-2002) a la reapertura de los caños, indicó que las capturas e ingresos económicos derivados de la pesca, los cuales mostraban tendencia a la disminución hasta 1996, aumentaron considerablemente en el corto plazo (durante 1999). Consistente con los cambios en el sistema, la captura en 2000 fue de 9.9 ton/año, alcanzando las expectativas del BID de 9.7 ton/año.
La correspondencia de eventos climáticos naturales y de origen antropogénico (apertura de caños) señala la importancia de contemplar en los análisis hidrológicos de la región, el fenómeno de ENSO/La Niña como un factor externo que influye significativamente en el comportamiento biofísico de la ecoregión de la CGSM, particularmente en el contexto del proyecto de rehabilitación de la CGSM. Por ejemplo, cuando el Caño Clarín fue abierto en 1996, el año previo fue uno de los años mas lluviosos (1995: 1900 mm) en la década de los 80 y principios de los 90. La disminución drástica de la salinidad en la Ciénaga La Redonda (de 58 g kg-1 en junio, a 6 g kg-1 en octubre) durante la época de lluvias en 1995, antes de la apertura total del Caño Clarín, indica el efecto de la descarga del río Magdalena cuando su nivel promedio anual (7.000 m3 s-1) es superado (11.000 m3 s-1) (Restrepo y Kjerfve 2000). De igual manera, la apertura del Caño Aguas Negras en 1998 coincide con la alta precipitación registrada en 1999, el valor mas alto (2500 mm) observado en la región de la CGSM en los últimos 30 años. El efecto de esta alta precipitación en la región se observa también en la Ciénaga de Pajaral donde la salinidad permanece menor a 8 g kg-1 durante el año 1999. El efecto directo del flujo de agua del Caño Aguas Negras en la reducción de la salinidad en aguas adyacentes a la boca del caño se observa en la amplia fluctuación de la salinidad en la Boca de Caño Grande donde en la época seca de 1999 y 2000 existe un incremento de la salinidad de hasta 19 g kg-1 ( de <1 a 11 g kg-1 en 1999; y de <1 a 20 g kg-1 en 2000).
Es a partir de esta coincidencia de eventos en los años en que se abrieron los caños que se asume que la reducción drástica de la salinidad en la CGSM y la alta regeneración de plántulas de manglar es el resultado directo de la obras hidráulicas. Es importante considerar que la distribución espacial de las isohalinas en la CGSM y el CP es dinámica y su localización en las diferentes épocas del año depende conjuntamente de la precipitación pluvial y la descarga del río Magdalena en el occidente, y los ríos de la SNSM en el oriente. Los caños tienen un papel significativo como conductores de agua proveniente del río Magdalena y los flujos máximos esperados influyen en la reducción de la salinidad a escalas menores en comparación al efecto de eventos de alta precipitación como los observadas en 1995 y 1999. Nuestros resultados indican el grado de influencia de estos eventos que deben ser considerados en la selección de medidas del éxito de proyectos de rehabilitación en ecosistemas costeros tropicales (Twilley y Rivera-Monroy 2005). Mas aún, esta información también puede contribuir al desarrollo de un “manejo adaptativo” (Zedler 2001) donde los flujos provenientes de los caños sean manejados de acuerdo a la condiciones ecológicas cambiantes, y las obras hidráulicas sean modificadas (por ejemplo, incremento en el flujo de agua) de acuerdo a las respuestas en la productividad del ecosistema. Así, los planes de manejo para la región necesitan incorporar el conocimiento adecuado de la interfase entre el clima y el ecosistema costero para establecer metas realistas para la rehabilitación del sistema y evaluar los costos monetarios reales. Particularmente por que se espera que la fluctuación de la salinidad en la CGSM y el CP variará significativamente en el futuro al presentarse años “secos” (<700 mm total anual) y “lluviosos” (>1900 mm). Ya que el fenómeno de El Niño-La Niña tiene un impacto en los vientos alisios en estas latitudes (Giannini et al. 2000, Wang y Enfield 2003), se espera que la intensidad, duración y frecuencia de este fenómeno tenga efectos significativos en la hidrología, y por asociación, en la distribución de la salinidad (suelo y agua) en el ecosistema de la Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta (Rivera-Monroy et al. 2001). La falta de inversión publica y privada para mantener las obras hidráulicas a partir de 2001 ha causado un incremento gradual de la salinidad y el deterioro de la vegetación regenerada y ha puesto este proyecto en una ruta de fracaso que puede revertir los avances alcanzados hasta el año 2000. Al igual que al inicio del proyecto original, se requiere de un esfuerzo internacional y del Gobierno Colombiano para mantener en forma sostenida los beneficios sociales y económicos estratégicos alcanzados hasta la fecha. Es claro que la situación social y económica actual de Colombia impide un inversión a largo plazo de la magnitud requerida (aprox. 10-20 millones de dólares) para este tipo de proyectos. No obstante, es necesario una reactivación de la inversión para la conservación y uso sustentable de una de las zonas costeras estratégicas de alto valor ecológico y económico a nivel mundial. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/italy-dune-restoration-on-the-coast-of-the-tyrrhenian-sea/	Italy: Dune Restoration on the Coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea	Italy	1995-06-25	2000-06-25	"Restoration was undertaken on sand dune environments along the coastal belt of the Castelporziano nature reserve near Rome, Italy using “soft techniques” applied over an area of approximately 3 km. Forty dunes were built up in three belts located at < 40 m, 40-70 m, and > 70 m, respectively, from the shoreline. On each of 38 dunes, 20 individuals of Ammophila littoralis were planted, as this autochthonous species is considered particularly suitable for the stabilization of sand dunes. After one year, two years and five years, respectively, the changes in height and surface of each dune; the survival rates of A. littoralis, and its changes in cover; the appearance of new shoots; and the establishment of new species were observed. A progressive increase in species number, which five years after the restoration amounted to about 60% of those characterizing the natural dunes, was reported indicating a progressive trend towards populations similar to natural ones. Overall, the project has proven effective in facilitating a vegetative succession parallel to natural dune colonization processes.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry European sandy coastlines are everywhere under threat of extensive erosion (e.g. van der Maarel 1979; Anon. 1998; De Lillis 1998; Dean & Dalrymple 2002), in particular along the Mediterranean coastlines. Here ca. 75% of the sandy coasts are presently degraded (Géhu 1985; Salman & Strating 1992).
The series of mobile dunes on the Tyrrhenian coastline of Lazio, along the Roman littoral facing the high tide mark is virtually absent. Along this coastline the elements of the various plant associations are forced back to the next belt, where they are thus overlapping and compressed along a narrow and not very high dune system.
Extensive human activities in littoral areas are widespread, and the factors causing disturbance are of a various nature. In fact, from the twentieth century onwards a strong intensification of human activities has been registered. This includes cattle grazing, farming, tourism, road construction and expansion, reforestation and agriculture. Along the shoreline of the Italian peninsula, under natural conditions, there is a succession of various plant associations from the outermost dune belts, directly subject to the action of the sea, to the more sheltered inner ones (Lucchese & Pignatti 1990; Vagge & Biondi 1999). Starting from the sea, the first community is represented by the Salsolo kali-Cakiletum maritimae (Rivas-Martínez et al. 1992), barely inside the high tide mark, followed on the embryonic dunes by the Sporobolo-Elymetum farcti (Géhu et al. 1984), on the shifting dunes by the Echinophoro spinosae-Ammophiletum arundinaceae (see Géhu et al. 1984), and in the interdunal spaces with accumulation of organic matter by the Crucianellion maritimae (Braun-Blanquet 1933). This pioneer vegetation is followed on the consolidated dunes by pioneer macchia with junipers: Asparago acutifolii-Juniperetum macrocarpae (Bolós 1962; typus Géhu et al. 1990). –To build up dune belts along the coast, located between the high water mark and the macchia vegetation behind this (consolidated dunes)
–To determine the optimal distance from the sea for planting Ammophila littoralis on the dunes which had been built up
–To verify the sustainability of restoration management approaches

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: In June 1995, 40 dunes were built up, accumulating sand on a base of dry trunks and branches of Quercus species occurring in the estate; these dunes were shaped according to the more or less elliptical morphology of the already existing ones. The sand used, of equal grain size, was taken from the sandy area immediately inland in order to avoid the presence of seeds from other vegetation types. The 40 built-up dunes formed three belts located at different distances from the high water mark: 14 at a distance of < 40 m (33 - 40 m) from the sea, 15 at a distance of 40 - 70 m, and 11 at a distance of > 70 m (70 - 86 m).

In January 1996 20 individuals of Ammophila littoralis, taken from the neighbouring dunes, were transplanted on each of 38 built-up dunes, and distributed evenly over their surface. In order to compare both the evolution of the morphology and the natural colonization of the plant species in the absence of the stabilizing species, A. littoralis was not transplanted on to the last two dunes, at a distance of < 40 m from the sea.

The phenology of the main species of the natural dune system was followed by means of monthly observations, from June 1995 until October 1996, in order to identify their growth and reproductive phases. At the same time the fruits were collected and the seeds at various stages of maturation were isolated. In October 1996 and in February, April and June 1997, germination trials were carried out on the main species present: Ammophila littoralis, Anthemis maritima, Cyperus capitatus, Cakile maritima, Elymus farctus and Pancratium maritimum  -  to verify the reproductive capacity of the seeds of each species.

The change in height and area of each dune, the survival of A. littoralis, the change in cover, the appearance of new shoots and, lastly, the establishment of new species were monitored after 1 yr, 2 yr and 5 yr from the starting phase. The cover of A. littoralis was measured as percentage of the surface covered in a grid-plot with eight subplots of 0.25 m2 each. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Germination rate and time was largely different among the species examined. In some species, such as C. capitatus, C. maritima and A. littoralis, germination ranged between 20 and 30%, and took from two up to five weeks. It reached 60% in P. maritimum, the species that took longest (almost seven weeks) to germinate. E. farctus exhibited the highest germination rate, 80%, but its seeds had the shortest germination time, just two weeks.

The survival rate of individuals of A. littoralis, between January 1996 and February 2001, changed from 96 to 66%, on the dunes closest to the sea; at a distance between 40 and 70 m it decreased fairly slowly during the first year (99%) up to 74%, that is the highest survival rate registered in 2001 and, lastly, on the dunes furthest inland, more than 70 m from the sea, it remained at 100% until June 1997, after which it decreased to 60% in 2001.

The average cover of A. littoralis also changed in time according to distance from the high water mark: in the first six months, from December 1996 to June 1997, the cover increased, especially on the dunes more than 70 m from the sea where it reached an increment of 50%. However in the next four years the trend changed and in February 2001 the cover tended to be highest, although not significantly, at the intermediate distance. Over the latter period the cover tended to decrease slightly on the dunes at a distance of less than 40 m and more markedly on the dunes at more than 70 m ; the cover was quite constant, between 25 and 30%, on the dunes at intermediate distance from the sea (40 m < d < 70 m).

Between October 1996 and February 2001 the average number of vegetative shoots for each dune increased progressively: from 11 to 53 in those nearest to the sea, from 9 to 38 in those located at a greater distance, while the number increased from 10 to 56 in those located at the intermediate distance. The number of new shoots was lowest on the dunes at more than 70m), though not significantly.

During the five years of observation the number of species that colonized the new dunes increased progressively from 7 (June 1996) to 16 (July 2000). These were autochthonous species, germinated from the seeds occurring in the sand used for building up the dunes. The two dunes where A. littoralis did not occur show a smaller number of species than the others: two germinated in June 1997: Cakile maritima and Raphanus raphanister ssp. landra, and six in July 2000: Elymus farctus, Anthemis maritima, Eryngium maritimum, Cyperus capitatus, Sporobolus pungens and Crucianella maritima. In June 2001 the average number of species on each dune belt was highest (6.6) at the greatest distance from the sea (d > 70 m) and lower in the other dune belts (4.6, d < 40 m; 4.2, 40 m < d < 70 m).

At the same time the total plant cover varied between 15 and 60% with an average of 28.6% and was composed mainly of A. littoralis.

A. littoralis was the dominant species with 25% of the cover; among the species that germinate after planting Ammophila, only Anthemis maritima, Elymus farctus and Echynophora spinosa reached fairly high cover values. The range of the frequency of the species, from 3 to 90%, is very great: there are species present only on a few dunes (C. maritima, S. kali, S. pungens), whereas other species are widely represented (A. maritima, E. farctus, E. maritimum).

The morphological characteristics of the dunes, the height and the surface particularly, showed a progressive change over time. The height decreased progressively in all the three belts. In July 2000 the height of the dunes located more than 70 m from the sea was about 60% of the initial one, that of the dunes closest to the sea was 50%, and that of the dunes located between 40 and 70 m from the sea was 49%. 

In the two control dunes, i.e. without A. littoralis, the height progressively decreased until July 2000 when it reached 47% of its initial value; the height of the control dunes was very similar to that of the dunes located in the belt < 40 m from the sea. In the course of time the surface area of the dunes tended to increase due to the accumulation of sand at the sides of each dune. The surface area of the dunes at more than 70 m from the sea changed from 25 m2 to 34 m2 and, similarly, in the dunes located in the belt between 40 and 70 m from the sea the area increased from 27 m2 to 35 m2, that is, by ca. 30%. However, at a distance of less than 40 m the surface did not change because at this distance the accumulation of sand at the sides was offset by their partial destruction by the tides; consequently the average area remained 29 m2 the whole time. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The belt closest to the sea, in spite of the progressive increase in the number of shoots, showed a decrease of the survival rate of A. littoralis, due above all to the violent coastal storms which have partly destroyed some of these dunes, so that the cover showed small fluctuations only.

It is noteworthy that no increase in dune height can yet be observed, five years after the transplantation, probably because the cover reached by A. littoralis is still inadequate, even though relatively extensive.
The fast growth rate of transplanted Ammophila littoralis shoots, and the resultant increase in cover, highlights the potential of this species to facilitate the restoration of sandy coast environments. It is well known that A. littoralis forms a barrier that blocks the transport of wind-blown sand so that, at the base of the aerial shoots, and therefore also on the surface of the dune, new sand grains are deposited. By this mechanism, a close link is established between the dune systems and A. littoralis: the dune grows by constant deposition of sand grains, and at the same time, it stimulates the development of new roots and of the soil fauna (van der Putten et al. 1989), which are essential for maintaining the survival and the vigour of this species (Hope-Simpson & Jefferies 1966; Eldred & Maun 1982).
The present study also shows the strong consolidation potential of A. littoralis for dune build-up: survival of the tufts of A. littoralis transplanted can exceed 70% and cover reached after 5 yr in the belt between 50 and 70 m from the sea is high (40%), though still lower than on natural dunes (Pignatti et al. 2001).
If survival, cover and the number of growth shoots are taken into account, the belt between 40 and 70 m appears the most suitable one to guarantee the effectiveness of restoration techniques such as those performed in this study, since those closest to the sea are damaged by coastal-storms, and those furthest from the sea did not guarantee a favourable habitat as the survival rate and the number of new shoots of A. littoralis highlights.
The morphological characteristics of the dunes, shaped by simultaneous erosion and accumulation of grains of sand, become gradually modified: in all three of the belts considered, a reduction is noted in the height as well as an increase in the surface area. In some cases, the dunes examined actually tend to lose their initial elliptical shape due to the direction of the dominant winds, and they become crescent shaped. On the dunes furthest inland, where the grains of sand carried by the wind are most often deposited, the reduction in height is less marked.
Colonization by new species is relatively rapid and takes place with species such as Anthemis maritima,
Cakile maritima, Elymus farctus (= Agropyron junceum), Cyperus capitatus (= C. kalii), Ononis variegata and Eryngium maritimum, which play a role – albeit a secondary one – in the deposition of sand (Pignatti 1993). This indicates a progressive development towards populations similar to natural ones. Prevalent among these species are those of the associations Sporobolo-Elymetum and Cakiletum, whereas the species established subsequently pertain mainly to Ammophiletum and Crucianelletum. This gradual and directional process is in accordance with the natural dune colonization: the rapid establishment of pioneer species on the embryonic dunes is followed by a slower colonization by the species of the mobile dunes.
The recolonization process presently underway at the study site is reflected in the establishment of a progressively larger number of species, up to the present number (16), on the dunes where individuals of A. littoralis have been transplanted. It is also of importance that the number of species increases with increasing height of the dunes from 20 to 150 cm; possibly this increase causes the development of a microclimatic gradient and the existence of more niches. The dunes where the number of species is highest are those furthest from the sea, more than 70 m, probably due to seeds incoming from the dune belt behind.
However, the cover of E. farctus, greater than that of other species, and on average greater than in the natural dunes further back (Pignatti et al. 2001), indicates an as yet relatively early phase of the succession. In comparison with the natural dunes of Castelporziano, where ca. 26 species have been observed (Anzalone et al. 1990; Pignatti et al. 2001), the colonization that has so far occurred amounts to some 60% of the species that characterize these environments. Still lacking, compared with the natural dunes behind them, are the following species: Pancratium maritimum, Pseudorlaya pumila, Daucus carota ssp. maritimus, Medicago marina, Lotus cytisoides and, on the dunes furthest from the sea, Silene colorata, Vulpia membranacea, Juniperus oxycedrus, Senecio leucanthemifolius and Sagina maritima. These are species linked with a certain degree of soil evolution and typical of stabilized dunes and of inter-dune spaces with accumulations of organic matter. In the two dunes without any A. littoralis, instead, the colonizing process by new species is much slower; at present it is equal to 30%, demonstrating that the presence of A. littoralis favours the settlement of new species.
Cakile maritima and Elymus farctus often occur in the built-up dunes closest to the sea, while in those situated furthest inland Anthemis maritima, Eryngium maritimum and Ononis variegata become established. In particular plant species referred to the Sporobolus-Elymetum farcti, which precedes the Ammophiletum in the series of mobile dunes, have mainly become established in the tongues of dune decay or in the spaces left free by the death of individuals of A. littoralis planted, and even between the dunes. This leads to a gradual modification in the structure of the built-up dunes which, at times, tends to merge with the natural dunes or to assume an aspect similar to them.
In conclusion, although at the present stage the dune system being built up is still too young to show evident effects on shoreline erosion, the data seem to indicate the effectiveness of the “˜soft techniques’ applied for the environmental restoration of this stretch of the Tyrrhenian sea coast. The results emphasize both the vitality of the rhizomes and the enormous potential of vegetative reproduction of A. littoralis. In general, for measures of this type, it seems in any case necessary to create a seed bank of the local autochthonous species and to set up a nursery in situ in order to guarantee the availability of seedlings and to minimize the negative effects of the method of collecting rhizomes in the field.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/india-restoration-of-banni-grassland-in-gujarat/	India: Restoration of Banni Grassland in Gujarat	India	1995-09-22	2008-09-22	"The Gujarat Ecology Commission (GEC), a body created by the Forest and Environment Department of the Government of Gujarat, initiated a restoration programme for Banni grassland in the state’s northern Kachchh district in 1995. Targeting lands degraded by overgrazing, woody species invasion and salinization, the project aims to improve ecosystem productivity, and thereby ensure the socio-economic resilience of local inhabitants in a region entirely dependent upon livestock and the rangelands that sustain them. Implemented by the Gujarat Institute of Desert Ecology (GUIDE) and the Vivekananda Research and Training Institute (VRTI) on a 15-hectare site at Bhirandiyara and a 200-hectare site at Dhordo, the project has employed a combination of methods, including: protection from grazing by a trench and/or barbed wire fencing; removal of weeds (e.g. Prosopis juliflora) to reduce competition; soil amendment via shallow ploughing, slope making etc.; farmyard manure application to improve the soil nutrient composition; and reseeding to improve the seed bank. With the help of a wet monsoon in 1997, the project has yielded promising results to date and has afforded practitioners much insight into the processes and factors that must be addressed in order to ensure an expeditious and sustainable rehabilitation of these grasslands.Agriculture & Livestock, Climate Change, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Even though grassland species of Banni have developed a variety of drought adaptations, a severe drought, perhaps, is the most important natural factor responsible for its degradation. It is also important to note that, severe consecutive droughts, which have occurred only twice between the period 1901 and 1980 (1904-1905 and 1968-1969), have increased abruptly during recent years (i.e. between 1981-1996). Three consecutive severe droughts, the first of its kind in this century, occurred from 1985 to 1987, and another two consecutive droughts occurred in 1995 and 1996. This situation has predominantly affected the soil moisture and thereby hastened the process of grassland degradation.
Although the Banni has always exhibited high salinity levels, the rivers that once flowed from the Kachchh mainland to Banni not only deposited the detritus and maintained soil moisture, but they also leached the salinity of the area during good rainfall years. The construction of 6 medium dams–namely, Rudramata, Niruna, Nara, Kaila, Kaswati and Gajansar–has nearly stopped the collection of water from a 1603 km2 catchment area, except during the heavy monsoon years. Thus, natural leaching of the salinity of different parts of Banni has been totally interrupted. In addition to this, seawater from the Kori creek entered the northern part of Banni due to the construction of Punjabi-road during the year 1965. Furthermore, the sparseness or absence of vegetative cover in high saline areas encourages the wind to transport salt particles from the Rann to fertile Banni areas, resulting in further increases in salinity. The cumulative effect of all these factors is the increased salinity in nearly 90 per cent of the Banni grassland.
In addition to these factors, the Gujarat State Forest Department, as a measure to check the advancement of the Rann, has planted initially about 31,550 ha exclusively of Prosopis juliflora. The successive droughts and increasing salinity of Banni provides more suitable conditions for the growth and extension of this species, which has today become the most dominant species and is spreading at the rate of about 25 km2 per year.
Grazing is another major problem in Banni grassland. Large herbivores are known to speed up the nutrient turnover rate in savannas (Ruess 1987, Ruess and McNaughton 1987). However, excessive or over grazing leads to massive degradation. During the normal rainfall years, livestock from neighbouring talukas and districts of Kachchh, and even from other states, totalling over 2 lakhs immigrates into Banni for grazing.
The grazing pressure in these arid rangelands ranges from 1 to 4 ACU (Adult Cattle Unit) per ha per year against the carrying capacity of 0.2 to 0.5 ACU per ha per year (Raheja 1966). In spite of the fact that one ACU in arid areas requires between 2 and 5 ha of pastureland, the available grazing land, which includes all categories–i.e. good, fair, medium and poor condition grasslands–in the Kachchh district, is less than 2 ha per ACU. Therefore, the grazing requirement of the entire livestock in the district cannot be met from the existing grassland resources.
The aforementioned issues have resulted in a severe unsustainability in Banni grassland, which decreased the human population from 14,389 in 1981 to 10,949 in 1991 (24 per cent), and livestock population from 49,240 in 1982 to 26,084 in 1992 (47 per cent). Among the three regions (east, west and central) of Banni, the eastern Banni has already lost its capacity to sustain both human and livestock populations, and the western Banni is slowly loosing its capacity. As a result, a maximum concentration of 55 per cent of the human (4149) and 65 per cent of the livestock population (7333) is located at central Banni region (GUIDE, 1998), exerting excessive pressures in this area which may lead to massive degradation due to over-exploitation of resources. Banni supports the growth of perennial and palatable grasses of high productivity, which grow in low to moderate saline areas. They are Sporobolus pallidus, Sporobolus helvolus, Dichanthium annulatum, Cenchrus ciliaris, Cenchrus setigerus, Desmostachya bipinata etc. High saline areas are colonised by perennial grasses of low productivity and palatability, such as Aeluropus logopoides, Eurochondra sp. etc. Among the tree species, Acacia nilotica was once distributed all over Banni. The shrub and tree strata were mainly composed of Prosopis cineraria, Acacia nilotica, Acacia leucophloea, Acacia Senegal, Salvadora persica, Salvadora oleodes, Capparis decidua, Tamarix sp. and Prosopis juliflora. Today, palatable grass and tree species like Acacia and Salvadora sp., though present, exhibit a significant decrease in abundance due to the massive invasion and dominance of Prosopis juliflora.
The wild animals of Banni include: Blue bull, Chinkara, Black buck, Blacknaped hare, Wild boar, Jackal, Grey wolf, Caracal, Hyena, Fox, Jungle cat, etc. It also supports a rich diversity of avifauna, herpatofauna, and invertebrates. Further, the water bodies of Banni, during good rainfall years, form important staging grounds for thousands of migratory cranes, and also support over 150 species of other migratory and resident birds. The primary objective set for the restoration programme is to return areas degraded by heavy grazing, high saline content, and infestation of Prosopis juliflora to former levels of productivity in order to improve ecological integrity and strengthen the local pastoral economy. Through this project, methods and techniques for the restoration of Banni grassland will be developed and evaluated, as will guidelines for the long-term sustainable management of this ecosystem.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: As a pilot measure, the restoration of Banni grassland was initially intended to cover a total area of 500 ha at 5 different sites. However, due to administrative and local issues in acquiring the land, the restoration programme could be successfully launched at only two sites--one located 11 km before Bhirandiyara and the other at Dhordo village, covering an area of 15 and 200 ha respectively.

The Banni grassland could be improved only in the good rainfall years. Since good years are generally followed by droughts in a cycle of every 3 years, or sometimes alternative years, the best method to improve grasslands is through protection from frequent grazing to facilitate the replacement of undesirable annual grasses with productive perennial species. Protection from grazing allows the perennials to produce large quantities of seeds. Thus depending on the condition of a site, a continuous protection from grazing develops the ground layer principally made up of perennial grasses (Kanodia and Patil, 1983). The same improvement can be achieved, albeit at a slower rate, with either a deferred or rotational grazing system where the grasses are protected up to seed dispersal. Therefore, the first step in any restoration strategy, of course, is to protect the disturbed habitats and communities from being further wasted, and from losing the extant genes (Singh and Jha, 1993).

As a measure to protect the Bhirandiyara restoration site from livestock grazing, a trench fence consisting of 1.2 m width and 1 m deep was laid along the periphery of the site. There are views that trench fencing is not a foolproof method to protect the grass plot from cattle. However, its effectiveness as a barrier depends upon the width and depth of the trench. Therefore, a barbed wire fence around the site was also raised to ensure double protection from any kind of grazing. It has been reported that the protection of grasslands with the help of barbed wire fencing increases forage production of better grasses (Bhimaya et. al. 1967, Ahuja 1977, Kanodia et. al. 1978). At Dhordo restoration site, due to the coverage of a vast area of 200 ha, it was decided to have only trench fencing. However, to ensure full protection from cattle, a 2-m wide and 1.5-m deep trench was dug along the periphery of the plot, which covers a length of 6000 m. The mud removed from the trench was also used to raise a 1.5 m high mud wall on the inner fringe of the trench, thus ensuring complete protection from cattle. This method of fencing, though less expensive as compared to barbed wire fencing, requires maintenance every year. Apart from its cattle-proof function, the trench also helps in harvesting rainwater due to its vast length, depth and width.

Prosopis juliflora infestation is believed to be the major cause in reducing the productivity of pastureland and hindering the growth of grasses. Unwanted thorny bushes need to be removed mechanically or manually to eliminate the competition. Even useful fodder bushes, such as Zizyphus nummularia, should not be allowed to grow more than 4 per cent in a grazing area, so as to maintain the forage production from the pasture (Ganguli et. al. 1964). Hence, Prosopis juliflora and other unwanted bushes growing inside the restoration site were totally uprooted with the help of the Gujarat Forest Development Corporation.

Succession of vegetation in a natural sequence is a time consuming process and can be expected to succeed in the desired direction only if the nucleus of the plant material is available in a productive stage on a given site. Plantation of seed slightly below the surface after scratching it or in strips with appropriate species of grasses is the quickest and most ensured method of improvement of degraded grassland (Kanodia and Patil, 1983).

For reseeding, first preference was given to indigenous grass varieties, which normally grow under arid climatic and soil conditions of Banni. Therefore, indigenous seeds were obtained from Banni Development Agency, Bhuj, as well as from the Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute, Jhansi. Indigenous species such as Cenchrus setigerus, Sporobolus sp., Eurochondra sp., Dichanthium annulatum, Chloris barbata and Cenchrus ciliaris, were selected for sowing in the restoration site. Species such as Chrysopogan fulvus and Pennisetum pedicellatum were also sown in small quantities, although the later species was not reported from Banni area. The performance of this species in the restoration site (i.e. growth and productivity) will aid in planning future large-scale introductions of such species over the entire Banni area. The reseeding activity, it is hoped, will increase the seed bank of the area, and thereby enrich the grass density and diversity of the restoration site.

In arid areas, under rainfed conditions, the sowing of grass seeds is normally done in the months of June/July with the onset of the monsoon. To enhance the germination and uniform distribution of seeds, the seeds were mixed with soil and farmyard manure. Then they were thoroughly mixed by sprinkling water. This reduces the transport of seeds through wind, and the moisture in the seed mixture hastens the process of germination. Care was taken to ensure that the seed sown was covered by a 1- to 2-cm soil layer. Because the grass seeds are very small, the stored germplasm is insufficient to support the germination and growth of seedlings from deeper soil layers. The stocking rate of seeds varied with the species. The normal stocking rate of seed reported is: 2.5 kg/ha for Dichanthium annulatum; 5 kg/ha for Cenchrus ciliaris and Cenchrus setigerus; 5 kg/ha for Sporobolus sp. etc. to 75 kg/ha for Lasiurus species. However, keeping in mind the near absence of a seed bank in the restoration sites, a stocking rate nearly 3-4 times higher than the normal was used.

The Bhirandiyara restoration site was divided into four sub-compartments, each covering an area of approximately 3.4 ha. The first compartment was kept under natural conditions (Compartment 1), where the fencing (trench and barbed wire) ensured complete protection from livestock grazing. Both pure and mixed combinations of grass seeds (e.g. Cenchrus sp. with Sporobolus sp.) were sown within the compartment. However, a strip (10m width and 250 m length) covering an area of 3750 m2 was kept completely under natural conditions, where no sowing of grass seed was undertaken. The basic view was that the area devoid of seed sowing resembled very much that outside the fenced area of the site; the only difference between these two was that the former received protection from grazing, while the later was subjected to grazing pressures. Hence, a comparison of the productivity of grass species of the said area with that outside the fenced site would provide data about the effect of grazing pressure that existed in the area. The mixed combinations of seeds were used to ascertain with species associations were more favorable in terms of productivity.

At Dhordo restoration site, the whole area was divided into 30-m wide strips. Ploughing, broadcasting of grass seeds and addition of farmyard manure were carried out at alternative strips.

In natural pastures of arid regions, the scope of fertilisation is limited mainly due to the uncertainty of rainfall. In Banni, the sale of cow dung has further limited the natural supply of manure, affecting soil nutrients and plant growth in the area. Under favorable circumstances, the two-way system whereby nutrients are consumed through grass feed and then returned to the soil through dung ensures that little or no loss of nutrients from the grassland area takes place. In order to rectify the nutrient deficit and improve soil composition at the restoration site, farmyard manure was added at the rate of 2 tonnes per ha. Apart from improving the nutrient status of the degraded land, this practice will improve such physical properties of the soil as permeability, soil structure, etc. Moreover, the chemical binding of dung with that of soil is known to reduce the soil salinity to some extent.

Grass-legume mixtures are always desirable because of their complementary functions in providing nutritive and palatable forage for livestock. Legumes usually maintain their quality better than non-legumes, even at maturity, and being rich in protein, they enhance the forage value and also add substantially the needed nitrogen to the soil. Thus, grasses directly or indirectly benefit from the use of nitrogen components manufactured by the legumes. On death and decay of the legume plant, its roots and root nodules break down in the soil and release their stored nitrogen, which then becomes available to the associated crops. In order to take advantage of these qualities, legume species like Afylosia sp., Sesbania sp. and Stylo hamata were sown at the restoration sites. Sesbania, in particular, produces high quality fodder that can also be used as cattle feed.

The restoration site selected at Bhirandiyara was located in a highly saline track of Banni. In this site, experimentation on salinity reduction and control was undertaken to improve the grass diversity and productivity. This site was divided into four equal compartments, of which, compartment 1 is left under natural condition where no soil modifications were carried out. Compartment 2 was ploughed to a depth of 50 cm to improve the soil permeability, water infiltration and to break up-surface crust. In this compartment, organic manure was also added at the rate of 2 tons/ ha.

To leach the salinity of the research site, 5-m wide gentle slope with a height of 30 cm, and with drainage channels 50 cm deep and 50 cm wide, was dug in Compartment 3. Similar activities, with changes in the width of the slopes to 3 m and height of the slopes to 50 cm, were conducted in Compartment 4 to study the effects of increasing the slope height on the grass species diversity and productivity. Compartment 4 was further sub-divided such that half the slopes and the trench faced northwest and the other half faced east-west. The basic view of this amendment was to study the effects of wind-borne salt deposition on the diversity and productivity of grass species growing on the slopes facing towards and against wind direction. It is hoped this will help generate additional information on the deposition of salt particles through wind action and its impacts on the productivity of different grass species growing in the area.

The Dhordo restoration plot encompasses an area of 200 ha (width 1km x length 2km), located near village Dhordo. The whole area of the site was divided into 30-m wide strips. Ploughing, adding farmyard manure and sowing grass seeds were carried out in alternating strips. Prosopis juliflora growing inside the fenced site was removed, with the exception of a few individuals, in which the side branches were removed in order to change the structure of the plant. There is a common view that the spreading cover of Prosopis juliflora reduces ground cover, and that a modified structure would assist in supporting understory vegetation. Furthermore, it is thought that the tree may also act as a windbreaker, thus providing a valuable service under certain circumstances. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: GRASS COVER
At Dhordo, there was a marked variation in grass cover at three study sites, i.e., restoration site (site A), outside unprotected area (site B) and Prosopis juliflora infested areas (site C). The restoration site was broadly classified into two categories: unploughed area where no soil working was carried out and ploughed area where soil working such as ploughing, addition of farmyard manure and reseeding of grass species was undertaken. The grass cover estimated in the ploughed and unploughed area of site A gradually increased from 56.7 and 54.7 per cent in September to 67.4 and 72.1 per cent respectively at the end of November, with a slight fall (57 and 65 per cent) in the first fortnight of November. Further, the unploughed and ploughed area did not record any significant variation in grass cover between the initiation and the end of the study period. Nevertheless, the grass cover was slightly higher in unploughed areas since October when compared to ploughed area.

Contrary to this, unprotected and Prosopis juliflora infested areas showed very low availability of cover, which, during the study period, decreased from 15.4 to 10.7 per cent and 30.7 to 8.3 per cent respectively. However, site C showed a higher cover than site B during the initiation of the study. 

A comparison between the unploughed protected area (restoration site) and unprotected area (site B), which have similar climo-edaphic conditions, showed significant variation in grass cover. The grass cover of the former was 3.6 to 6.7 times higher than the latter during the entire period of study. This clearly demonstrated that grazing pressure in the unprotected area was significant. The cover increased by 10.7 and 17.4 per cent respectively in the ploughed and unploughed areasof site A, while it has decreased to 6.1 per cent at site B and 22.4 per cent at site C.

At Bhirandiyara, the monthly mean cover in the restoration site was 49 per cent at the initiation of the study in October, and thereafter it showed a slight increase in November and remained almost stable up to the first fortnight of December, except that it showed a slight fall in the second fortnight of December. In the unprotected (outside) area, maximum cover was recorded in the first fortnight of November (69.4 per cent) and gradually decreased during the post-monsoon period, attaining a minimum of 19.4 per cent at the end of December. Thus, initially (i.e. first fortnight of November) the unprotected area showed a higher cover than the restoration site, but then decreased significantly by the end of the study, indicating clearly the effects of grazing pressure on the unprotected area. 

The grass cover recorded under various amendments of the restoration site showed similarities in certain areas and variation in others. The cover estimated was very high (76.9 per cent) in the unploughed area and drastically low (17.5 per cent) in the narrow horizontal slopes. Interestingly, looking at the various amendments of the restoration site, the cover showed a decrease during the study period in the unploughed, ploughed and broad slopes, whereas it showed an increase in the narrow vertical and horizontal slopes. The unploughed area in the restoration site had higher cover availability during the beginning and end of the study period, while the ploughed area exhibited a slightly higher cover during the middle period--i.e. first fortnight of November to first fortnight of December. Among the three types of slopes in the restoration site, almost similar cover availability was recorded at broad (50 per cent) and narrow vertical slopes (46.3 per cent), while on the narrow horizontal slopes it was low (17.5 per cent) during October. However, at the end of December, the narrow vertical (50.6 per cent) and horizontal slopes (45.6 per cent) had the maximum cover, which in turn decreased to 38.8 per cent on the broad slopes. Overall, narrow vertical slopes showed a higher cover than other two slopes except in October and first fortnight of December.

SPECIES DIVERSITY
In Dhordo, a total of 25 species belonging to 20 genera were recorded in the restoration site, which in turn decreased to 18 species (72 per cent) in the unprotected area (site B) and 17 species (68 per cent) in the Prosopis juliflora infested area (site C). The occurrence of species such as Cenchrus ciliaris, Cyperus haspan, Chrysopogan fulvus, Scirpus sp., Setaria pallide, Themeda triandra, Tragus sp. and Sporobolus pallidus was restricted to the restoration site; whereas Sporobolus helvolus, Aeluropus logopoides, Dichanthium annulatum, Tetrapogan tenellus, Tragus sp., Chloris barbata, Cyperus rotundas, Echinocloa sp., Cenchrus setigerus, Eragrostis sp., Dinebra rotroflexa, Gandhiro, Digera rnuiicata, Aristida funiculata and Cressa erotica are some of the species found in all the three sites (A, B and C) at Dhordo.

At Bhirandiyara, a total of 12 plant species belonging to 11 genera were recorded, which in turn decreased to 6 species (50 per cent) in the unrestored area. Further, within the restoration site, the number of individuals of the species fluctuated under different soil amendments. The species occurrence was high in the unploughed area (91.7 per cent) and slightly lower on vertical slopes (75 per cent). In other areas, about 66.7 per cent of the species were recorded. Cyperus haspan, Cyperus rotundus, Scirpus sp., Sporobolus helvolus, Aeluropus logopoides and Cressa erotica are the common species, which were recorded in all the amendment areas of the restoration site, as well as the unprotected site. Dichanthium annulatum was seen only on vertical slopes, while the occurrence of Chrysopogan fulvus and Setaria sp. were restricted to the unploughed area of the restoration site.

Sporobolus sp. forms the dominant species in both ploughed and unploughed areas of the Dhordo restoration site while at site B and C, Cyperus rotundus was dominant. The dominance index of seven species; Cyperus rotundus, Chloris barbata, Aeluropus logopoides, Gandhiro, Echinocloa sp., Cenchrus sp. and Tetrapogan tenellus was comparatively higher in the ploughed area than the unploughed area. At site B, Aeluropus logopoides forms the second dominant and was followed by Chloris barbata and Sporobolus sp. At site C, the second dominant species was Chloris barbata while Sporobolus sp. and Cenchrus sp. forms the less and least dominant' species respectively.

In Bhirandiyara, Cyperus haspan forms the dominant species in all the amendments and unprotected area except in narrow vertical slopes where Aeluropus logopoides exerted domination. Sporobolus sp. was found to be second dominant in ploughed and broad slopes whereas it was third dominant in narrow vertical and horizontal slopes. Cenchrus sp. was least dominant in unploughed and narrow horizontal slopes but, totally absent in ploughed and unprotected area.

BIOMASS - Dhordo
At Dhordo, data on biomass was collected from three sites: site A, site B and site C. Among the five samplings carried out between September and November 1997, maximum biomass obtained at site A, B and C was 3546.9 kg/ha in the second fortnight of October (mid study period); 618.3 kg/ha in September (beginning of study); and 410 kg/ha during end of November (end of study) respectively.

It was also noted that unploughed and ploughed areas showed variation in the productivity of grass species. Interestingly, the biomass recorded was higher in the unploughed areas than in ploughed areas, although the monthly increase in productivity recorded was higher in the ploughed area. Between September (1511.9 kg/ha) and November (2736.9 kg/ha), the biomass increased by 81 per cent in the ploughed area, while it increased by only 67 per cent (2177.8 to 3639.8 kg/ha) in the unploughed area. This increase was precipitated by the improved productivity of such species as Cenchrus sp. (221 to 692 per cent), Chloris barbata (96 to 149 per cent), Echinocloa sp. (26.5 to 442 per cent), and Dichanthium annulatum (23 to 60 per cent). Contrary to these observations, increase in Sporobolus productivity was higher in unploughed area (216 per cent) than in ploughed area (104 per cent).

There was a considerable variation in the productivity of different grass species in the three sites of Dhordo. A total of 12 important and commonly available grass species (Cyperus rotundus, Chlohs barbata, Sporobolus sp., Setaria sp., Aeluropus logopoides, Eragrostis sp., Gandhiro, Echinocloa sp., Cenchrus sp., Dactyloctenium aegyptium, Tetrapogan tenellus and Dichanthium annulatum) were selected for analysis. The total biomass estimated for these 12 species at three sites varied from 2505 kg/ha at site A, 230.3 kg/ha at site B and 201.9 kg/ha at site C. The biomass recorded at site C was 12.3 per cent less than site B. The 12 species encompass 87.2 per cent of the biomass estimated at site A, 67.3 per cent at site B and 64.1 per cent at site C. The biomass of a few highly palatable species such as Sporobolus sp., Cenchrus sp. and Dichanthium annulatum encompasses 31.7, 11.1 and 10.3 per cent respectively at site A, whereas it decreased to 14.5, 0.0 and 1.3 per cent respectively at site B and 3.6, 0.004 and 0.3 per cent respectively at site C. Contrary to this, the biomass contribution of species like Cyperus rotundus, Aeluropus logopoides and Chloris barbata, which are comparatively less palatable at matured stage, was least at site A--7.6, 3.8 and 11.2 per cent respectively--while it was 27.9, 23.3 and 16.7 at site B and 21.6, 12.2 and 19.2 at site C.

Between September and November, total biomass of these selected 12 species showed an increase of 75.6 per cent at site A, whereas it decreased to 44.7 per cent at site B and 40.1 per cent at site C. The comparison of biomass of grass species between September and November at site A shows that, except three species (Cyperus rotundus, Setaria sp. and Dactyloctenium aegyptium), all other species showed an increase. Among the species at site A, maximum increase was recorded for Sporobolus sp., which alone encompassed 22 per cent of the biomass in September to 36 per cent in November, followed by Cenchrus sp. (4.8 per cent in September to 12.9 per cent in November) and Chloris barbata (5.9 per cent in September to 9.8 per cent in November). These three species alone represented nearly 32.7 per cent biomass in September, which increased to 58.8 per cent in November.

BIOMASS - Bhirandiyara
The biomass in the restoration site gradually increased from October to December; 1115.9 kg/ha in October to 2228.7 kg/ha in December and thus, showed an increase of 99.7 per cent, whereas it decreased to 31.5 per cent in the unprotected area during the same period. Among the five sub-compartments (unploughed, ploughed, broad slope 0.3m height x 5m wide, narrow vertical slope 0.5m height x 3m wide, and narrow horizontal slope 0.5m height x 3m wide) of the restoration site, narrow slopes showed a maximum increase of biomass between October and December--279.6 per cent in vertical slopes and 171.9 per cent in horizontal slopes. This was followed by the unploughed area (112.8 per cent), broad slopes (42.9 per cent) and ploughed area (25.9 per cent). This indicates clearly that the recovery of saline area in narrow steep slopes was faster. The biomass estimated (i.e. all grass species) within the restoration site was higher in the unploughed area than in the ploughed area for all months (excepting the first fortnight of December). Among the slopes, the broad slopes with a width of 5m had more biomass production (except during the end of December) than narrow vertical slopes of 3m width. The biomass of the narrow horizontal slopes was found slightly higher than the narrow vertical slopes during the first fortnight of November and December, while in other months, it showed lower biomass than the vertical slopes.

Cyperus haspan made a major contribution to the biomass of the area, representing 41.6 per cent of the productivity of restoration site and 82.6 per cent of the unprotected area. Grass species such as Sporobolus sp., Cenchrus sp., Aeluropus logopoides, Dichanthium annulatum etc., sown in the area were capable of growing even under low moisture availability, whereas C. haspan - a water-loving species - requires high moisture for its survival and growth. Therefore, it was presumed that there will be a change in the contribution of C. haspan in the various amendment areas following the monsoon--i.e. from October to December. To confirm the above, and to understand the recovery process of different sub-compartments of the restoration site, biomass was analysed with and without the contribution of C. haspan.

During the month of October, C. haspan constituted more than 67.8 per cent of the biomass of the restoration site, which in the month of December decreased to 34.9 per cent. Further, this species was found almost equal in ploughed (49.8 per cent) and unploughed areas (46.7 per cent) of the restoration site. However, it decreased to 43.7 per cent in the broader slopes and 38.4 per cent in narrow horizontal slopes, and a very low contribution of 17.5 per cent was recorded in narrow vertical slopes. The contribution of C. haspan decreased from 75 per cent in October to 45.6 per cent in December in the unploughed area, while in the unprotected area, it decreased from 83.4 to 74.9 per cent. A comparison of data during the same period in other sub-compartments showed that the percentage contribution of C. haspan changed from 61.8 to 50.1 at ploughed area; 75.2 to 19.4 at broad slopes; 54.9 to 12.5 at narrow vertical slopes; and 56.6 to 34.7 at narrow horizontal slopes.

An increase in other grass species (excluding C. haspan) was recorded maximum at narrow vertical slopes (635.9 per cent), followed by broad slopes (363.2 per cent), narrow horizontal slopes (309.3 per cent), unploughed (164.8 per cent) and ploughed areas (64.4). In contrast to this, the outside area showed a decrease of 23.5 per cent.

Apart from C. haspan, the biomass of five other common grass species of the site (Sporobolus sp., Aeluropus logopoides, Echinocloa sp., Cenchrus sp., and Scirpus so.) was analysed. The biomass contribution of these species varied from 67.5 per cent of the mean biomass production on vertical slopes to 35.2 per cent on broad slopes. Among the five grass species, biomass of Aeluropus logopoides, a saline tolerant species, was found maximum in all sub-compartments except ploughed and broad-slope areas. Ploughing and the addition of farmyard manure favoured the growth of Sporobolus sp., where it contributed 41 per cent of the biomass amongst the five species. In the broad slopes, both Sporobolus sp. and Aeluropus logopoides were found in almost equal abundance. In the unprotected (outside) area, (excluding C. haspan), Aeluropus logopoides was found to be the dominant species (88.6 per cent of the biomass).

Amongst the five sub-compartments, contribution of Sporobolus sp. was maximum in the narrow vertical slopes (29.1 per cent), followed by unploughed (22.7 per cent) and ploughed (24.4 per cent) areas. Species like Aeluropus logopoides and Echinocloa sp. were dominant in unploughed areas, while Cenchrus sp. dominated (32.9 per cent) the narrow vertical slopes. Surprisingly, this species was totally absent in the ploughed area. The species Scirpus sp. was more prevalent in the ploughed area (38.3 per cent) when compared to unploughed area (23.2 per cent).

The herbaceous stratum of the Bhirandiyara restoration site, and the surrounding area, was dominated by Cressa cretica. This species contributed about 21.2 per cent of the biomass. Among the sub-compartments, the unploughed area had the lowest biomass contribution of Cressa cretica (4.4 per cent) and was followed by vertical slope (20.4). In the other sub-compartments, it contributed more than 25 per cent to the total biomass, with a maximum contribution of 34.7 per cent in horizontal slopes. In the unprotected area, it represented about 15.2 per cent of the biomass. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: In the restoration sites, the productivity was found to be higher in the unploughed area than in the ploughed area. In the ploughed area, the natural seed bank, along with tillers and rhizomes of grass plants, were disturbed due to ploughing activities, while in the unploughed area, these were left undamaged. Therefore, in the unploughed area, fewer showers were required to activate the vegetative growth of grasses from tillers or rhizomes. In the ploughed area, grass has to develop from the germination of seeds of different species sown in that area. The grass seeds have certain adaptations to survive in the harsh conditions, and not all seeds of a grass plant will grow after a single shower. Even in a single grass plant, seeds produced in the same spike have different levels of dormancy (an adaptive mechanism) and might germinate after a single shower, or they might require multiple showers. For example, seeds of grass species such as Cenchrus sp. require a certain amount of moisture to wash the inhibitors present in the seed coat before germination. This could be one reason for the late recruitment/germination of certain grass species like Cenchrus sp. in the ploughed area. Further, after the germination, the plant would take at least one full season to establish, and this may be an important reason for obtaining more biomass from unploughed areas than ploughed areas at both the restoration sites.

At Bhirandiyara site, waterlogging is a common feature during heavy rainfall years. This creates a favorable environment for the growth of Cyperus haspan and Cyperus rotundus (unwanted annuals). Such a favourable situation prevailed during September 1997. Within 36 hours, the area received about 458 mm rainfall, which resulted in waterlogging for more than a fortnight. This enabled the rhizome of C. haspan to grow enormously and vigorously in and outside the restoration site, which is less palatable due to its high fibrous nature. Further, the implementation of soil amendments carried out on about 75 per cent of the restoration site disturbed the rhizome of C. haspan. These brought out higher cover and biomass availability during the initial period in the unprotected area, which was slightly higher than the restoration site of Bhirandiyara, as well as unprotected and Prosopis juliflora area of Dhordo site.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Livestock is the mainstay of the inhabitants of Banni, and constitutes the bulk of their assets. Out of 10,949 people in Banni (1991 census), 2443 people are entirely engaged in livestock rearing and other allied activities. This pastoral economy depends primarily on the extent and condition of available grasslands to support grazing, especially given the region's aridity. Besides just pasturelands, though, Banni grassland is also a source of other products of local economic importance, such as: leaves, seeds and tubers for human consumption, as well as medicinal plants, building materials, thatch, fencing, gums and other products important in the rural economy (Sale 1981 and NRC 1983).

During December 1997, over 1,75000 kg of grass was harvested from the Dhordo restoration site, a quantity of fodder sufficient to meet the livestock needs of 6 surrounding villages for more than 1 year. Similarly, at the Bhirandiyara site, biomass increased from 1115.9 kg/ha in October 2007 to 2228.7 kg/ha by December, and thus showed an increase of 99.7 per cent. This improvement has favorable implications for local herders.
Although there are reports of failure in the artificial restoration of degraded grasslands (Bronner 1990 and Westoby et al. 1989), the GEC’s activities have been relatively successful, and recovery of the degraded and saline land could be clearly visualized from first-year results. These results reflect higher species diversity, grass cover and biomass in the two restoration sites than the unprotected and Prosopis juliflora infested areas. The net above-ground production estimated for nine USA grasslands by Sims and Singh (1971) ranged from 107 g/m2 (1070 kg/ha) (ungrazed short prairie) to 512 g/m2 (5120 kg/ha) (grazed tall grass prairie). The obtained biomass during the month of November/December in a high saline tract of Bhirandiyara was 2 times higher than the minimum biomass recorded by Sims and Singh, and Dhordo was about 3 times higher. The dense grass cover that developed in the restoration sites reduced the evaporation rate, and this, in turn, reduced the surface soil salinity–from 13 EC to less than 4 EC in the Bhirandiyara restoration site. These findings highlight the fact that the productivity of any degraded saline lands can be improved through proper management actions. The activities currently being undertaken by the Gujarat Institute of Desert Ecology (GUIDE) and the Vivekananda Research and Training Institute (VRTI) promote the rehabilitation and natural recovery of the two Banni restoration sites, Bhirandiyara and Dhordo. However, because successional processes take considerable time, the measures employed thus far have enabled only moderate progress toward restoration, most of that being achieved after the 1997 monsoon. Under these circumstances, it will take at least two more years to develop well-founded management guidelines for this area. "

Con el comienzo de la época de urbanización a finales de los años 60, esta zona sufrió una degradación de sus ecosistemas bastante pronunicada, debida a la instalación de infraestructura urbana y el aumento del turismo que se observó tanto en esta zona como en todo el litoral mediterráneo español. En el año 1981 el Ayuntamiento de Valencia inició un programa de restauración ecológica con la finalidad de combatir los cambios drásticos que se habían observado a nivel paisajístico y regenerar el funcionamiento del ecosistema dunar para favorecer un gran número de especies vegetales y animales de gran valor. El proyecto, en curso hasta la fecha con el apoyo del programa LIFE de la Unión Europea, se realiza con una combinación de restauración geomorfológica, revegetación de las dunas reconstruidas y adecuación de los áreas restauradas a los numerosos visitantes que vienen de paseo a este sitio. Las actividades ya realizadas han rehabilitado una gran extensión del primer cordón dunar, mostrándose ejemplares en términos de una metodología rápida y efectiva, y la initiativa sigue con la restauración del segundo cordón dunar y la revegetación de su comunidad de enebros nativos.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry A lo largo de la historia tanto del lago de l’Albufera como su Devesa fueron, durante siglos, propiedad real. La larga pertenencia a la corona española y las restricciones en la explotación para los ciudadanos, explica que estos espacios naturales mantuvieran un estado de conservación aceptable a pesar de estar tan cerca de núcleos densamente poblados e intensamente desarrollados. A finales de los años 60, en pleno “boom” turístico español, se inicia un proceso de urbanización en la Devesa que altera gravemente sus ecosistemas, situación que se repite en todo el litoral mediterráneo español. El cordón dunar exterior fue arrasado casi en su totalidad, las depresiones interdunares rellenadas con arena y repobladas con eucaliptos y la alineación dunar interior fue fragmentada con la construcción de carreteras, edificios e infraestructuras hidráulicas y eléctricas.
El Plan de urbanización iniciado a finales de los años 60 afectó de manera diferente a cada uno de los ecosistemas de la Devesa, siendo especialmente destructivo en el ecosistema de dunas móviles. El primer cordón dunar, exceptuando el “Muntanyar del Pujol” y el “Muntanyar de La Rambla”, se arrasó en su totalidad con la finalidad de construir un paseo marítimo, aparcamientos, viales, urbanizaciones y todas las infraestructuras necesarias para dar servicio a estas. Este arrasamiento supuso la desaparición del paisaje dunar y la adquisición de una morfología totalmente homogénea y plana, ocasionó un desorden en la distribución de la vegetación típica de este ecosistema, la casi desaparición de algunas especies psamófilas como el Otanthus maritimus L. y la Euphorbia paralias L. y la aparición de especies nitrófilas. Al mismo tiempo, al desaparecer la barrera natural que servía de protección frente a la acción del viento del mar, también se produjo una regresión del matorral y arbolado situado detrás de este ecosistema.
A esta situación habría que añadir las consecuencias generadas por el estado de la playa, entre las que destacan el nulo o escaso aporte de arena, el paso diario del tractor de la limpieza que impide la formación espontánea de pequeños embriones dunares y el efecto negativo que ocasiona sobre una playa, ya de escasas dimensiones, la existencia de un obstáculo impermeable como el paseo marítimo que impide la disipación de la energía del oleaje aumentando su efecto de arrastre. Hasta la década de 1960 el ecosistema dunar de la Devesa presentaba un aspecto muy distinto al actual. Desde el mar hacia el interior se encontraba, después de la playa seca, un gran cordón de dunas móviles que en algunos puntos llegaban a alcanzar los 10 metros de altura. Tras este primer cordón, había un segundo cordón de dunas semimóviles constituido por calderas de abrasión y dunas de hasta casi 10 m de alto. Finalmente aparecían las dunas fijas pobladas con una exuberante vegetación, donde el estrato arbóreo predominante está constituido por pino carrasco (Pinus halepensis) y pino piñonero (Pinus pinea). Tanto el cordón de dunas semimóviles como el de dunas fijas, estaba salpicado de una gran red de lagunas que se encharcaban durante la estación húmeda y se secaban a medida que avanzaba el verano. Este encharcamiento es posible gracias a una capa de limos grises de unos 15-40 cm de espesor que le proporciona impermeabilidad. Estas zonas son conocidas localmente con el nombre de “malladas”.
Las dunas litorales móviles son edificadas y modeladas principalmente por vientos de componente E, que inciden contra una costa con orientación NNW-SSE, por lo que el costado de la duna expuesto a levante se denomina barlovento y el expuesto a poniente sotavento. A la transición entre ellos, que al mismo tiempo es la parte más elevada de la duna, se denomina cresta. Por último, las pequeñas acumulaciones de arena, siempre ligadas a la presencia de plantas, que hay en la playa y, generalmente, próximas a la base de la duna, reciben el nombre embriones dunares. La finalidad del proyecto es la regeneración de los hábitats dunares en la Devesa de l’Albufera de Valencia y la difusión del proyecto entre los ciudadanos y la comunidad científica. De esta forma se pretende que los ciudadanos tomen conciencia de los valores naturales del lugar, y que esta zona vuelva a tener unas características ecológicas y paisajísticas semejantes a las que tenía antes de que se degradase.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: La restauración se realiza en tres etapas: primero se efectúa la restauración geomorfológica, luego la restauración de la cubierta vegetal y por último la adecuación del área restaurada para recibir a los usuarios de las playas.

--Restauración Geomorfológica--
En la restauración geomorfológica se trata de recuperar las características existentes antes de la urbanización, pero adaptándolas a las condiciones ambientales actuales y al paisaje existente hoy en día.

Una vez determinada la geomorfología del área dunar a recuperar, se ejecuta el proyecto utilizando maquinaria pesada adecuada para realizar los movimientos de tierra necesarios para conseguir la forma de la duna o del cordón dunar. La maquinaria pesada trabaja siempre intentando causar el menor daño posible a la vegetación existente en la zona de actuación y evitando perturbar a los animales en su periodo de cría.

El volumen de arena disponible en el área de actuación siempre es menor del requerido para la creación del cordón dunar, por lo cual este déficit ha de ser solventado. La falta de arena se ha solucionado obteniéndola de procedencias distintas según cada proyecto. Algunas veces se ha extraído aumentando el tamaño de las pequeñas depresiones formadas por el viento (calderas de abrasión) después de que fuese arrasado el primer frente dunar y antes que la vegetación volviese a colonizar la zona. Otras veces procede de las depresiones interdunares (o malladas), que tienen un origen distinto a las anteriores (tectónico) y que fueron rellenadas con parte de la arena procedente del arrasamiento del primer frente dunar. Con una extracción adecuada de la arena, se consigue que las malladas adquieran su aspecto y características originales. La arena se ha extraido también de la zona norte del puerto de Valencia, en un sector donde se produce una acumulación por el efecto barrera de este. La arena de esta zona presenta una granulometría muy pequeña y se ha tratado de paliar este inconveniente ubicando esta arena dragada en la parte más interna de la duna, que luego ha sido recubierta con arena de grano más grueso procedente de la Devesa--lo que proporciona a la duna una mayor estabilidad frente al viento. Una vez dada la geomorfología adecuada a la duna, se estable un sistema de empalizadas semipermeable y biodegradable, capaz de retener la arena acumulada por un lado, y por otro captar aquella nueva que pudiese llegar a través del viento o del mar.

Tras varios años de experiencias con diferentes materiales, distintas disposiciones, diferentes alturas y grado de permeabilidad se confirmó que las empalizadas más adecuadas, por su funcionalidad, su coste económico e impacto ambiental eran las construidas con cañas secas (Arundo donax) y borró (Spartina versicolor), dispuestas en una trama ortogonal, en la que se mantiene una separación longitudinal entre las empalizadas de 4 veces la altura de la misma, una permeabilidad al viento de un 40-50% y una altura entre 50 y 80 cm. Con el tiempo las empalizadas se cubren de arena (2Âº-3Âº año), se pudren (4 Âº-5 Âº año) y desaparecen, alcanzando la duna un aspecto totalmente natural a partir del 6 Âº-7 Âº año. En la zona de sotavento las empalizadas tardan más en desaparecer debido a que no suelen quedar tan cubiertas debido a la menor movilidad de la arena en este sector, ya que esta se encuentra fijada por la vegetación, lo que causa que la velocidad de degradación de la empalizada sea menor.  

--Restauración de la Cubierta Vegetal--
La obtención del material vegetal para las repoblaciones es una de las primeras necesidades que tuvo la Oficina Técnica Devesa-Albufera (OTDA) para poder impulsar la recuperación de los hábitats degradados y se tradujo en la puesta en funcionamiento de un vivero donde producir las especies necesarias para la restauración de la cubierta vegetal. Aprovechando un pequeño vivero forestal construido en 1964, las experiencias en la propagación de las plantas autóctonas de la Devesa fueron iniciadas en 1981 y continúan en la actualidad. A lo largo de este tiempo se ha ido ampliando el número de especies que son producidas y se han completado las instalaciones con que cuenta el vivero. Una prioridad en la producción de plantas ha sido la conservación de la diversidad de la genética local. Para lo cual se ha procurado potenciar, en primer lugar, la multiplicación por semillas. Cuando esto no ha sido posible se ha tenido que recurrir a vías de multiplicación vegetativas, pero en este caso, al igual que con las semillas, el material ha procedido del mayor número de individuos posible. Actualmente el banco de semillas cuenta con más de 170 especies diferentes de la Devesa y la Albufera, entre las que se encuentran la práctica totalidad de las especies características de los ecosistemas dunares. Las semillas proceden de la recolección de frutos en el campo, ya que no se han creado colecciones de plantas madre por ser contraproducente para la conservación de la diversidad biológica, son tratados en el taller hasta alcanzar un estado de limpieza suficiente para permitir una cómoda utilización o su almacenamiento. Para conservarlas se secan mediante la utilización de gel de sílice hasta un 5% de humedad, en cámaras herméticas y a temperatura ambiente. Luego son guardadas en bolsas estancas de plástico. Las bolsas se almacenan en el banco de semillas, que consiste en una habitación que cuenta con un aparato de aire acondicionado que impide que la temperatura pueda superar los 18Âº C.

El segundo paso en el proceso de la restauración de la cubierta vegetal consiste en la repoblación con especies psamófitas autóctonas. Existen diferencias en la elección de las especies a utilizar según los diferentes sectores de la duna, distinguiéndose entre embriones dunares, vertiente de barlovento, cresta y vertiente de sotavento.

Una precaución importante a tomar consiste en transmitir convenientemente al personal que realiza la repoblación que coloquen las plantas alejándose de una distribución lineal o de retícula regular, es decir, hay que colocar las plantas aleatoriamente procurando obtener un aspecto lo más natural posible.

Cuando se ha repoblado sobre dunas reconstruidas con arena proveniente de malladas desaterradas se ha observado un vigor superior del normal en las plantas repobladas y en las nitrófilas que aparecen espontáneamente. Esto se sospecha que se debe a una riqueza de nutrientes en el substrato superior a la habitual y que es debida a la recarga de materia orgánica que ha experimentado la arena durante el tiempo que ha estado colonizada por los herbazales que invadieron las malladas aterradas. Debido a las condiciones ambientales de la duna esa materia orgánica se va mineralizando y va produciéndose un paulatino empobrecimiento de los nutrientes que contiene la arena, por lo que al cabo de dos o tres años las plantas dunares recuperan su fisionomía normal y disminuye drásticamente la presencia de nitrófilas como Salsola kali y nitrófilas alóctonas como Xanthium strumarium. 

La forma de presentación de las plantas es una cuestión que en cualquier repoblación dunar hay que decidir, puede ser en semilla, en plantón y en esqueje. Para la mayoría de especies los tres modos son posibles, pero la idoneidad de uno u otro depende de los resultados esperados, ya que cada alternativa difiere en la susceptibilidad a ser transportada por el viento, en la rapidez del desarrollo, en su mayor capacidad de fijación de la morfología dunar, en su porcentaje de éxito, en los requerimientos de mano de obra, de medios materiales y presupuestarios, entre otros. 

También existen ciertas particularidades que afectan a los trabajos de plantación en las dunas. Los plantones deben enterrarse, además del cepellón, la práctica totalidad de la parte áerea, quedando por encima de la arena exclusivamente los 10 cm superiores, lo cual supone que el cuello de las plantas quede a una profundidad de 15-25 cm y no a nivel de la superficie, como suele ser normal en otro tipo de repoblaciones. Es importante aplicar este criterio ya que aunque conlleve un mayor esfuerzo físico durante la plantación se consigue poner las raíces en una situación con mejor aprovisionamiento de humedad y es más difícil que los plantones queden desenterrados por el viento. Los esquejes deben ser de al menos 20-30 cm de longitud, se plantan enterrándolos lo más verticalmente posible y dejando sin cubrir por la arena solo los primeros 5 cm. Los bulbos de Pancratium maritimum L. se utilizan desprovistos de hojas y enterrados a la mayor profundidad posible, que al menos debe ser de 25-30 cm. La Echinophora spinosa L. y el Eryngium maritimum L. son cultivadas en macetas y cuando se transplantan, como suele coincidir con el periodo en que carecen de órganos aéreos, se puede utilizar todo el contenido del contenedor o sólo la raíz extraída de entre el sustrato. Las semillas son plantadas a una profundidad del doble de su diámetro, por lo que es muy posible que si hay vientos fuertes, sean desenterradas, arrastradas y depositadas en la base de las empalizadas, lo que no es muy perjudicial al objetivo, ya que el único inconveniente de este hecho es que en los primeros años la distribución de algunas especies en las dunas no será igual a la natural, pero con el paso del tiempo éste efecto desaparecerá.

Las plantaciones se realizan de manera manual ya que las condiciones del terreno desaconsejan cualquier otro tipo de técnica, aunque las macetas son aproximadas a los tajos de trabajo por vehículos de carga que puedan transitar por la playa. También se utilizan pequeñas carretillas autopropulsadas y con tracción de orugas de goma para el reparto de plantas y herramientas por el interior del campo dunar. Lo ideal es plantar durante el periodo que abarca desde las primeras lluvias fuertes del otoño hasta finales de invierno, pero se puede alargarlo hasta mediados de primavera sin muchos inconvenientes. De las experiencias llevadas a cabo por la OTDA se puede concluir que el desarrollo completo de la cubierta vegetal es un proceso que abarca de 4 a 6 años, aunque a los 2 o 3 años ya se alcanza un estado muy próximo al buscado.

--Adecuación del Area Restaurada a los Visitantes--
Para que una restauración tenga éxito se debe cerrar el área regenerada, facilitar los accesos y realizar una campaña de información a los visitantes.

Para el cierre provisional del área regenerada, se rodea toda la zona de actuación con vallado construido con estacas y cañas y se colocan carteles informativos avisando de la prohibición temporal de entrar en la zona.

La ordenación del tránsito peatonal consiste en la adecuación de accesos desde los aparcamientos hacia la playa consistentes en pasarelas de madera que tiene como objetivo la canalización de los visitantes para evitar el pisoteo de la zona en proceso de regeneración. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: --La Playa de la Malladeta--
La primera actuación sobre esta playa, realizada en el año 1984 consistió en la permeabilización del murete mediante la colocación sobre él de haces de ramaje de eucaliptos con el objetivo de conseguir una deposición natural de la arena. 

La segunda actuación de restauración dunar iniciada en otoño del año 1988, consistió en la aceleración del proceso de acumulación de arena sobre el murete iniciado unos años antes, mediante una intervención mecánica. Se construyó así un cordón dunar sobre un tramo de paseo marítimo de unos 800 m de longitud, quedando este totalmente cubierto por la duna. La acumulación de la arena se realizó mecánicamente y se extrajo de la parte posterior del paseo, exagerando pequeñas calderas de abrasión que había generado el viento poco después del arrasamiento. Para la creación del perfil de barlovento se utilizó arena procedente de un barrido superficial de la playa situada delante del murete. Se creo así sobre una superficie aproximada de 4.800 m2 un frente dunar continuo, paralelo a la costa, con la finalidad de minimizar el efecto erosivo de la acción del oleaje sobre la playa, eliminar el impacto paisajístico que suponía el murete y proteger la vegetación que se desarrollaba detrás de este primer frente. La altura de la duna osciló entre los 4-5 m sobre el nivel del mar. La altura de la arena acumulada sobre el murete varió entre 0,5 y 1,5 m, según los tramos. En dos de las calderas, de donde se extrajo la arena se excavó por debajo del nivel freático, formándose 3 lagunas de unos 150 m2 de superficie cada una y con una profundidad entre 20 y 50 cm. En las orillas de las dos situadas más al sur se plantaron 190 tarajes. Con la creación de éstas lagunas se aumentó la diversidad paisajística y se crearon unas condiciones que fueron rápidamente explotadas por insectos, anfibios, peces, aves, mamíferos y ciertos grupos de plantas.

A los dos años después de finalizada la intervención se podía constatar claramente que los resultados fueron muy positivos. La vegetación había experimentado un óptimo desarrollo, consiguiendo estabilizar la arena. La práctica totalidad de las barreras habían quedado enterradas, desapareciendo el aspecto artificial que le conferían a la duna.

A lo largo del tercer año después de realizada la actuación se empezaron a producir pequeñas brechas en el cordón dunar que iban dejando al descubierto parte del murete que principalmente fueron causadas por el pisoteo que padecían las dunas. Con el tiempo estas aumentaron de tamaño descubriéndose cada vez trozos más amplios y multiplicándose las pérdidas de arena. El viento modelaba la duna, acumulando en unas zonas y erosionando en otras.

En otoño de 1997 se inicia la tercera intervención. Dada la evolución de una parte del cordón construido sobre el paseo se lleva a cabo la experiencia de desmontar la duna situada sobre los últimos 62 metros del extremo sur de esta construcción, de eliminar completamente ésta, incluida la cimentación, y de volver a recrear el cordón dunar en el mismo lugar. Esta actuación se completa con la realización de otro edificio dunar, situado en la parte trasera del cordón restaurado y con una extensión de 31 m de longitud por 42 m de ancho aproximadamente. La superficie de actuación supuso una extensión total de aproximadamente 2.542 m2. Con esta actuación se solucionó definitivamente el efecto negativo que sobre la estabilidad de la playa suponía la presencia del paseo marítimo. 

La cuarta actuación, realizada en otoño de 1998 fue la continuación hacia el norte de la actuación desarrollada con palpable éxito en el año anterior. La regeneración fue de 10.940 m2, se actuó en un tramo de 547 m de longitud. Las obras que se llevaron a cabo fueron equivalentes a las efectuadas el año anterior, salvo que no se realizó ninguna repoblación ya que la arena utilizada contaba con un buen banco de semillas y restos de plantas que rebrotaron en poco tiempo. Un año después, se efectuó una repoblación para completar las densidades adecuadas en las zonas que así lo requerían. También se excavó una zona que quedó por debajo del nivel freático, creando así una zona inundada que sustituyese a las pequeñas lagunas creadas en 1988 y que en ese momento presentaban un avanzado estado de colmatación. La restauración de la playa de la Malladeta ha sido óptimo.

--La Playa de Els Ferros-Garrofera--
A lo largo de 1990, se llevó a cabo un proyecto de restauración de un tramo de 12.000 m2 de playa en las conocidas como la playa de La Garrofera y la playa de Els Ferros. El proyecto consistió en la aportación, sobre un frente de playa de casi 2 km de longitud, de 500.000 m3 de arena procedente del norte del puerto de Valencia. Incluía también la eliminación del paseo marítimo y la creación de una berma de 65 m de largo por 3 de alto coronada hacia el interior por una duna de 4,75 m de altura y una cresta de 4 m de ancha. El perfil con el que se diseñó el cordón dunar presentaba una vertiente igual en barlovento que en sotavento. Hoy en día el viento ha variado esta configuración presentando la  duna una altura menor. En esta zona se hizo una primera repoblación entre los meses de octubre a diciembre de 1990 y una segunda en la primavera de 1991 en la que se aumentó el número de plantas, observándose una adecuada evolución.

--La Playa de El Canyar--
En el año 1982 se efectuó en esta playa uno de los primeros ensayos de regeneración dunar, que consistió en construir con máquina excavadora una duna de unos 7 m de alto. La duna desapareció en poco tiempo debido a la acción del viento, su escasa vegetación y una excesiva proximidad a la línea de costa. En el año 1991 se actuó en una superficie de unos 2.200 m2, creándose un cordón dunar de unos 100 m de longitud y una anchura media de unos 20-22 m. La altura que alcanzó esta duna fue 4,80 m, la máxima que se pudo dar con los medios mecánicos con los que se disponía en ese momento.

--La Playa de El Saler--
Las principales acciones fueron realizadas en esta zona entre 1997 y 2000 y consistieron en la demolición del paseo marítimo y la restauración del cordón dunar delantero utilizando arenas procedentes de la restauración de malladas, de la reconstrucción de calderas de abrasión y de la zona norte del puerto de Valencia, construcción de restaurantes y zonas de pic-nic, levantamiento de la superficie asfaltada de viales y aparcamientos y creación de un nuevo sistema de accesos, así como diseño de nuevos aparcamientos, creación de recorridos peatonales y de bicicletas que conecten las diferentes unidades paisajísticas, recuperación de las malladas del Quarter y de El Saler y restablecimiento de la cubierta vegetal característica de cada ecosistema.

En esta zona se le ha querido dar un uso lúdico, intentando centralizar a los visitantes en este lugar para descargar la presión antrópica de otras zonas más vírgenes de la Devesa. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Aún habiendo regenerado con éxito un 90% de la primera alineación dunar de la Devesa, ciertos factores ajenos a la OTDA, dificultan las labores de regeneración. La falta de sedimentos, la regresión del litoral en ciertos tramos o la destrucción de praderas submarinas de Posidonia oceanica son, entre otras, asignaturas pendientes que deberían empezar a solucionarse.
La restauración de ecosistemas dunares, apoyándose en unos estudios previos que lo fundamentan suficientemente y con la utilización de maquinaria convencional para el movimiento de tierras, es factible en aquellos casos en los que se conserva el volumen de arena necesario para recuperar los edificios dunares. Una vez recuperada la geomorfología las operaciones descritas permiten una restauración de las características paisajísticas y los elementos bióticos de este hábitat. En todos los casos, a los 2 años aproximadamente de haber finalizado la actuación, la cubierta vegetal ya realiza la función estabilizadora, las empalizadas empiezan a desaparecer cubiertas por la arena y la duna va adquiriendo un aspecto natural. En el caso de la Devesa, este proceso es más rápido en el sur que en el norte, donde el efect negativo del puerto de Valencia sobre el transporte de arena debido a la deriva litoral es menor. Desde el comienzo de la restauración en el año 1981, el proyecto se ha realizado en fases distintas. En esta fase se realizó la regeneración del primer cordón dunar por los métodos descritos y en el proyecto “Restauración de dunas litorales con Juniperus spp en Valencia” (Life Enebro) iniciado en octubre de 2004, se pretende el establecimiento de una población autónoma y natural de Juniperus oxycedrus subsp. macrocarpa en el segundo cordón dunar. Ya se han plantado más de 1.000 ejemplares y el proyecto también ha restaurado malladas y creado una laguna para introducir el fartet y el samaruc, dos especies pesqueras importantes en la región. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/peru-restoration-of-the-prosopis-pallida-huarango-southern-dry-forest/	Peru: Restoration of the Prosopis pallida (Huarango) Southern Dry Forest	Peru	2005-11-18	2008-11-18	"Conducted in the hyper-arid Atacama-Sechura ecoregion, the Habitat Restoration and Sustainable Use of the Southern Peruvian Dry Forest project aims to protect fast-disappearing Prosopis pallida forest relics and combat desertification by working with local communities in Ica, Peru to establish forest reserves and restore a patchwork of small, degraded trial sites. Using native plants reared in local nurseries, the project has carried out restoration activities at several small farming villages and has initiated a number of ambitious community outreach programs designed to foster public support and participation in spite of a social landscape fraught with complexities and competing interests. Practitioners have established an environmental education program at more than 10 schools in Ica; organized two Huarango Festivals to raise public awareness about the benefits of this endangered ecosystem; and helped form a local network to produce and market huarango food products (e.g. flour and syrup) in Lima and abroad. Through these actions, local communities have slowly begun lending their interest and support to project initiatives, and the foundation has been laid for a broad conservation program that will ultimately ensure sustainable local livelihoods and the longevity of a unique forest ecosystem.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Due to the long history of human occupation in the region, the dry forest on the Peruvian south coast has undergone centuries of deforestation and is now on the verge of extinction as a natural ecosystem. Anthropogenic pressures such as overgrazing, land conversion for agriculture, tree felling for charcoal production, and competition for scarce water resources have severely depleted remaining huarango forest relics, and it is estimated that during the last 30 years, 50,000 hectares have been lost in the Ica region alone–leaving less than 1000 hectares remaining (of which the majority is secondary forest). Adjacent saltmarshes, riparian and xerophytic ecosystems, and coastal lomas with unique endemic flora have also been degraded as a result of these pressures associated with encroaching human populations.
The loss of huarango forest has, in turn, led to widespread soil erosion and salinization throughout the region, and this slow desertification has been further exacerbated by a falling water table. Invasive Tamarix is taking advantage of the changing ecological conditions, and in May 2005, the blanket invasion of sand dunes over fertile land was recorded in areas of recent deforestation on the edge of the Ica Valley floodplain. The Atacama-Sechura Deserts ecoregion contains approximately 1300 plant species, 60 percent of which are endemic to the Atacama, while 40 percent are endemic to the Sechura. Recently discovered rare and endemic plant species include members of the genus Copiapoa, along with Griselinia carlomunozii and Tillandsia tragophoba. Sixty-eight species are found in both deserts and include: ferns, cone-bearing plants, cacti, and flowering plants that survive by absorbing moisture from fog and dew.
The remaining dry forest on this part of the Peruvian south coast has undergone centuries of deforestation and is nearing extinction as a natural ecosystem. The remaining plant community is characterized by several unusual, highly threatened ecotypes, all of which are now poorly represented. These include: riparian oasis, Andean outwash-fan dry forest, cactus-rich scrub bajadas, ephemeral streams or wadis, coastal lomas, marginal Prosopis coppice dunes, and Prosopis dry forests.
Prosopis pallida (Huarango), a leguminous hardwood, is the dominant arboreal species and provides a number of vital ecosystem services to the larger desert environment. With roots reaching depths of 50-80 metres–the longest roots of any tree in the world–the huarango taps deep stores of water for nourishment and in the process, draws water into more superficial subsoil, effectively creating a source of water for other plant life. Thus, the huarango provides islands of fertility and moisture, helps desalinate the soil, creates favorable microclimates, and represents a key refuge for biodiversity in these desert areas.
The ecoregion is home to more than 150 bird species, including three rare and endemic finches: Slender-billed finch (Xenospingus concolor); Great Inca-finch (Incaspiza pulchra); and Raimondi’s yellow-finch (Sicalis raimondi), and the endemic Pied-crested tit-tyrant (Anairetes reguloides).
Mammals inhabiting the region include the pampas cat (Leopardus pajeros), guanacos (Lama guanicoe), and sea lions (Otaria byronia). A panther was even spotted in the area recently. To protect remaining relics of huarango dry forest and create buffer zones around them in order to prevent further desertification.
To work cooperatively with local communities in the development of a system for the in situ production and processing of huarango pod products as an option for sustainable use of forested and reforested areas.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Although many of the principal outcomes of the project are focused on the development of realistic methodologies for restoration and the sustainable use of native biodiversity, without a genuine will to pursue these objectives among local community members and authorities–and without the capacity to do so–such methodologies will be of limited value. The project has therefore developed an increasingly strong emphasis on awareness raising and engagement, whilst focusing on enabling a wide range of local organisations and sectors (including, for example, agro-industry) to drive the processes forward with minimal or no requirement for outside financial input. It is believed that this will significantly strengthen the project’s long-term potential.

Description of Project Activities: The project began with baseline plant surveys, and 800 specimens of over 200 species have now been collected, annotated, and databased (previous inventories for the zone having registered only 128 species). This is the first detailed survey of the flora of the area, providing baseline plant diversity data for the restoration and sustainable use programme.

In June and July 2006, extensive seed collection was undertaken in order to gather a sufficient and representative selection of perennial and annual plants for habitat restoration and educational planting events. A temporary bank of over 30,000 seeds was collected from more than 50 key species, the project focus being the perennial and threatened species, successional annuals and Prosopis landraces.

In August 2006, a large native plant nursery (30 x 9 m) was established in preparation for the ongoing germination and propagation trials. The nursery is located on the grounds of the Faculty of Agronomy of the Universidad San Luis de Gonzaga Ica (UNICA) and is under the direction of local expert Felix Quinteros and a team of students. Several thousand seedlings of 24 key native species have thus far been produced for the following project initiatives: habitat restoration trial sites (1,800 plants); the education programme (1,200); community planting activities (900); the Huarango Festival (2,600); and restoration/conservation actions on independent fundos (2,000). 

Three additional on-site native plant nurseries have since been constructed--at Fundo Chapi, Fundo Santa Cruz and Huarangal--for a number of pressing reasons that include: damage to seedlings resulting from transport on very poor roads; a need for wider dissemination of project strategies and goals; and education. Half of the plant nursery in the Andean bajada village of Huarangal was designed to house Cactaceae. Like the huarango forest, this overgrazed and threatened ecotype also supports endemic plant rarities with excellent potential for fruit production and horticulture, as well as high conservation value. Furthermore, the cactus habitat supports two endemic Peruvian birds: cactus canastero and an unidentified subspecies of streaked tit-spinetail.

Because the support and assistance of local communities is so fundamental to the project's success, educational outreach and capacity building have been integrated into all phases of the restoration. An education programme has been established at more than 8 local schools (with plans for continuing expansion) in order to introduce children (ages 3-18) and students (up to 26) to a range of important environmental topics. The programme has centered on tree planting and has used interactive media to communicate the importance of ensuring native biodiversity and ecosystem services. Thus far, well over 3,000 children have participated in the programme, and of these participants, 1,200 have planted a tree. The education programme has now been expanded to include the national network umbrella of the highly successful NGO ANIA and its programme Tierra de los Niños. This relationship will facilitate the nationwide dissemination and exchange of information, and will help expand native planting efforts and increase the capacity of schools and children to play a key role in protecting threatened biodiversity. 

As an additional facet of public outreach and education, the first Huarango Festival was organised in Ica in April 2006. The festival was designed to raise local awareness and garner support for conservation actions before the inception of the main project. A second festival, held between 13 and 15 April 2007, was attended by over 3,500 people. More than 2,500 huarango seedlings from threatened productive landrace varieties were distributed during this event, and festival themes included: sustainable use of huarango food products, local ecology and biodiversity, cultural and environmentally focused music, theatre, and story telling. Various food products made from the project's huarango harvest (purchased from a small group of project producers at 80 centavos per kilo to help cover some of the festival costs) were demonstrated for tasting: ice cream, empanadas, cakes, biscuits, flours, coffee, marmalade, chicha (fermented brew) and duck stew. Since these festivals, the regional government has been very supportive and enthusiastic, declaring the 7th of April (a date that coincides with optimum huarango harvest) Dia del Huarango, for official inclusion in the municipal regional calendar.

In December 2006, a honey production trial was begun, wherein 12 hives were brought to the San Pedro trial site by a local producer from Asociación de Apicultores. The trial was intended to test production and provide apicultural training to the community. It was also hoped that the bees would clear up the leaf sugars produced by insect attack, and thus prevent sooty fungus from further damaging the saplings. Due perhaps to climate- and drought-related stress, there was very little nectar flow, and the trial did not prove as successful as hoped. Unfortunately, there are now very few areas were dry forest occurs in sufficient quantity to support honey production exclusively from the forest. In spite of the setbacks experienced, the project has been able to exchange information about nectar-producing native species with the Association, and appropriate species are now being included in trial habitat restoration areas. The project planned to continue pursuing experimental apiculture in San Pedro and Huarangal in August 2007, and if effective apiculture techniques can be established, honey will be sold with Miskihuranga (see below) in collaboration with the community trainees. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: By December 2006, four habitat restoration trials had been established at degraded sites, and cooperative agreements had been made with the landowners and communities associated with these sites. Two thousand plants are monitored monthly by UNICA and GAP students; ecological observations are made, and such growth indicators as plant height, stem width, canopy area, health, and mortality are noted. Avian biodiversity, activity and numbers are also recorded as indicators of ecological change, whilst pollination and seed dispersal roles are monitored in order to facilitate adaptive management. Reptile and ant observations are also made, as both groups play key roles in soil, seed and succession ecology in arid lands.

At the request of local communities (and with support from additional matching funds), trees and shrubs have also been planted in three community areas outside the habitat restoration trials--Victoria San Joaquin, FONAVI Pueblo Joven, La Banda Palpa--in order to combat desertification. Although not originally part of the programme, these small reforestation projects are relatively inexpensive, both in terms of time and money, and have a significant impact on local engagement in conservation efforts and overall sense of ownership.

One of the initial restoration sites (Fundo Chanca) is situated within an asparagus farm. The ephemeral stream habitat of Chanca is proving to be the key migration corridor and habitat for wildlife moving east-west between the Andes and the riparian habitats of the Rio Ica. A number of rare and endemic species of plants and birds, as well as reptiles, have been recorded in this habitat. The MOU with Fundo Chapi, the largest agro-industrial farm in the area, will provide seven hectares for 5,000 trees and shrubs. This area will provide an ideal location for rigorous comparative evaluation of habitat restoration techniques. Watering will be undertaken by workers from the farm, representing substantial added value for the project. The data from this homogeneous large area of protected land will complement the other four restoration sites, from which hard scientific comparative data are less easy to derive due to the heterogeneity of the conditions.

The management of both farms has shown a developing appreciation of the importance of native biodiversity and as demonstrated its capacity to align production objectives with conservation priorities under such agreements as SGS Eurep GAP. This is particularly significant, as these are among the largest asparagus producers exporting to US and European markets. The large workforce (over 500) on the two farms is allowing wider dissemination of project objectives, for which leaflets and posters are being provided by project staff.

Production in the nurseries has been steady, supplying almost 10,000 plants for project activities and providing a platform for experimental seed management. Germination, propagation and introduction trials have been competed for the 24 key species, including nine varieties of huarango, and over 20,000 huarango seeds have been extracted and stored. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The project has experienced a number of setbacks since its inception, and these have resulted from both social and environmental factors. 

Reliable sources of water for irrigation are vital to the project's overall success, but establishing and maintaining water supplies at the habitat restoration trial sites has proven challenging. At the San Pedro site, for example, the use of a well required over 10 community meetings and one workshop in order to gain the necessary trust support. Furthermore, 200m of irrigation canal had to be repaired, and a cement holding tank with a capacity of 10 cubic metres had to be built. The 700 plants at this site are irrigated by hauling 60 litres at a time in a wheelbarrow steered by two people. This job was initially performed by students and staff, but the local family participating in the sustainable management programme eventually assumed responsibility for the weekly watering regime when the cotton harvest ended.

Besides concerns about water, huarango trees have been suffering from a two-fold defoliating plague culminating in severe impact on pod harvests in the Nazca region (from 150 tonnes to virtually nil). The first plague is a virulent defoliating moth, Melipotis aff. indomita. This species is native to the area and historically causes defoliation until controlled by agents such as wasps, birds or cold weather. SENAMI (Servicio Nacional de Meteorología e Hidrología del Perú) has recorded a three-degree increase in minimum average temperature over the last 20 years, and the combination of temperature increase, pesticides, large-scale removal of habitat, and bird trapping are likely factors for the moth's prevalence. However, the caterpillar has been found easy to control through the use of traps. The method requires collection of the hundreds of larvae (that serve as excellent chicken feed) for 3-4 days consecutively from rags left at the base of the trunk (where the larvae roost during the day). The second plague is a Cercydomidyiid gall midge, which has now become a devastating problem. In order to combat these destructive plagues, project staff have begun considering more resistant varieties of Prosopis for propagation and reintroduction.  

Another considerable setback suffered by the project was the devastating earthquake that hit the region on 15 August 2007, the strongest felt anywhere in the world since 1990 (Richter 7.9). The quake left over 500 dead, 91,000 with destroyed or uninhabitable houses, and 1,278 badly damaged classrooms. The town of Pisco, 70 km from Ica, was 90% destroyed. These events have thrown much of the Ica region into disorder and affected the Huancavelica - the watershed for Ica. Several members of the project team either lost their houses or had them damaged, and some damage was sustained to wells and irrigation canals used by the project. Funds have been donated from the UK to help with the recovery.

Besides the myriad of intervening environmental factors, local prejudices have also been significant obstacles to achieving project goals. The knowledge of native plants is stigmatised as being associated with poverty. Increasingly, aspirational communities think that if you plant food trees in your home or street, it shows you are still poor. On the other hand, if you plant a tree such as Ficus benjamina  -  probably the most common house plant in the world  -  it shows you are part of an affluent neighbourhood and no longer need to grow your own food. Thus helping to raise awareness and change local perceptions will be crucial for the long-term success of the project.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Huarangos represent a critical resource for a region supporting a population of over 680,000 people. Not only do they play a pivotal role in ensuring overall ecosystem health by stabilizing the soil, combating salinization, enhancing soil fertility and moisture, and providing habitat for important fauna, they furnish food and a variety of forage products that have contributed to sustainable local livelihoods for thousands of years. With its deep roots, the huarango bears fruit reliably, regardless of erratic river flows--a quality that cannot be overestimated given the region's aridity and unpredictable hydrological patterns. Its bean pods are sweet and nutritious and can be harvested to produce flour and syrup, or eaten straight from the tree. Huarango wood is harder than oak and serves as an excellent construction material and firewood.
It is increasingly clear that a project such as this–which involves a large number of people from a range of strata of society; draws on several disciplines; addresses highly complex, poorly understood and in some cases sensitive issues; focuses on practical outcomes; and relates directly to livelihoods and policy measures–requires a high degree of flexibility in terms of methodology, logistical considerations, fiscal requirements, and social interaction. Although not originally specified as an output, the project aims to protect biodiversity by helping to establish small, community-protected areas in the remaining fragments of native forest. This is a complex and lengthy process that will require the development of a management plan with sustainable livelihoods options attractive to the local people and a Concession for Conservation (renewable after 40 years) granted by INRENA for each site integrated into the conservation scheme. Three small concessions have been solicited thus far: one in the name of the local community of San Pedro, and one with GAP in Usaca and Tunga (Rio Poroma). The concession for Usaca was approved by INRENA, but in October 2006, the previous owners expressed opposition to the initiative, even though the area had officially reverted to the State following the agrarian reform in 1969. This conflict of interests illustrates the kind of social obstacles against which the project must work if it is to achieve its goals.
For those areas in which restoration has been initiated successfully, project methods and strategies have been adapted to match local necessities and priorities, thereby maximising the likelihood of long-term management in restored areas and uptake of restoration techniques in other contexts. An effort has been made to include species of local economic value, and creative options are being explored for the re-incorporation of huarango resources in the local economy.
The project conducted market research reports for Lima and for local marketing in Ica, and these have been promising. Eight suitable outlets have been identified in Lima for the sale of Prosopis products generated at project sites, and discussions have been held with RBG Kew about highlighting Darwin Project products through the sale of Prosopis syrup in the UK.
There is an expanding group of willing suppliers of huarango fruits in the habitat restoration sites, and also within the proposed conservation concessions. Four local families form the nucleus of this netwok: Alarcon (Nazca), Anchante (Huarangal), Hernandez (Ica) and the workers of San Jorge Fundo. Fruit has also been purchased from two other small producers–for the Festival and for production trials (about 2,000 kg of fruit). Miskyhuaranga, a group of five students at UNICA, is undertaking market research and developing a project under the name Miskihuaranga (Miski means sweet in Quechua). The group will visit and receive training from the Algarrobita and Locuita project in northern Peru, hosted by the University of Puira and El CITE agro-industrial Puira. The aims of the trip are to: (a) learn the techniques of Prosopis fruit management in order to prevent bruchid infestation; (b) note and take photographs of production techniques; (c) interview the communities; and (d) complete a training video for workshops, website and dissemination of CD with the manual.
Two new electric mills–a hammer mill and a spice mill–have been donated by the Instituto Superior Tecnologico Leon de Vivero, in the Tinguiña suburb of Ica, for the processing of collected seed pods. An agreement has been made to allow the project products to be produced seasonally and the Institute to develop its own products while training students to use huarango flour in its adjacent bakery. In May 2007, construction was begun on a small building next to the bakery to house the mills. Profits made from these sales will be reinvested in the sustainable management programme and will also help finance the group. "

Una porción significativa del HEP dentro de la Reserva se ha degradado debido a una combinación de factores antropogénicos y naturales. Se llevó a cabo un experimento de replantación de fragmentos de corales para determinar su supervivencia y la viabilidad del método para restaurar el HEP para juveniles. Se replantaron 100 fragmentos naturales de 14 especies de corales. La sobrevivencia de colonias fue de 91% al cabo de 9 meses. Dicha sobrevivenvia se redujo a 79% al cabo de 10 meses debido al desprendimiento mecánico de 19% de los corales en una de las estaciones y a la destrucción de otro 27% debido a la acción humana. En promedio, 59% de las colonias transplantadas se consideraban visualmente saludables y las colonias libres de daños mostraron un incremento de 33% en la altura, 28% en el largo y de 34% en su área superficial. Los resultados de este estudio sugieren que el replantar fragmentos de corales puede convertirse en una herramienta adicional para el manejo y restauración de las pesquerías arrecifales en aguas llanas.Fisheries & Aquaculture, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry, Other El impacto físico principal de origen humano es el de caminar sobre el fondo coralino (por turistas, buzos y navegantes aficionados). Otros impactos antropogénicos incluyen la sobrepesca y la descarga ocasional de aguas sedimentadas y eutroficadas debido a escorrentías provenientes de terrenos parcialmente desmontados. Además, los huracanes recientes han causado una fragmentación significativa de corales en aguas a profundidades menores de 3 m (Hernández Delgado, datos no publicados). Se sugiere que dicha combinación de factores ha causado la pérdida de parte de la heterogeneidad espacial del fondo llano del arrecife, la cual es importante para proveer refugio a los estadíos juveniles de peces (Gladfelter y Gladfelter, 1978). Las áreas someras del arrecife de coral bordeante localizado entre Punta Melones y Bahía Tarja, dentro de la Reserva Pesquera Marina del Canal de Luis Peña (RPMCLP), Culebra, P.R., constituyen un área de criadero natural de peces de alto valor comercial (Pagán Villegas et al., 1999). Estas zonas son parte del Hábitat Esencial de Peces (HEP) para las especies manejadas por el Consejo de Administración Pesquera del Caribe. Aunque la cobertura de corales estimada no excede de 30% (Pagán Villegas et al., 1999), su diversidad de especies de corales y de peces es representativa de la región noreste del Caribe (Hernández Delgado, 2000; Hernández Delgado et al., 2000). Dicha localidad está dominada por sistemas extensos de arrecifes bordeantes someros (<5 m) y por yerbazales marinos. Otras comunidades incluyen pavimentos coralinos, fondos arenosos, arrecifes rocosos y una llanura arrecifal pobremente desarrollada (Hernández Delgado et al., 2000). Llevar a cabo un experimento de replantación de fragmentos de corales para determinar su supervivencia y la viabilidad del método para restaurar el Hábitat Esencial de Peces (HEP) para juveniles.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: El área de estudio se localizó en un arrecife de coral bordeante somero (2 m) en Bahía Tarja, en la costa oeste de Culebra (aproximadamente, 18Â°18.195'N, 65Â°18.620'O). Se colectaron 100 fragmentos naturales de 14 especies de corales localizados a profundidades menores de 3 m y se replantaron en 3 cuadrantes de aproximadamente 4 x 4 m. Uno de los cuadrantes se localizó justo en la ruta principal de acceso desde el mar hacia la playa (Tratamiento 1: T1=expuesto). Los otros dos se localizaron aproximadamente a 50 y 80 m al norte de éste (Tratamiento 2: T2=media distancia; Tratamiento 3: T3=lejos). Para llevar a cabo los transplantes se utilizó concreto hidráulico de secado rápido (Muñoz-Chagín, 1997), el cual se mezcló bajo el agua dentro de una bolsa plástica sellada con un poco de agua de mar hasta alcanzar una consistencia pastosa. Se limpió el sustrato de sedimentos y algas utilizando un cepillo con cerdas de metal, se virtió el concreto y se colocó el fragmento. El secado ocurría generalmente en unos 10 a 20 minutos.

Se replantaron 9 especies de coral en cada cuadrante en el mes de septiembre de 2000 y se determinó la condición de los corales al cabo de 9 meses (junio, 2001) y al cabo de 10 meses (julio, 2001). Cada colonia se midió utilizando un calibrador. Dependiendo de la especie y la morfología del fragmento, se midió el largo y ancho máximo (ej. corales masivos Montastrea annularis, Diploria strigosa, Porites astreoides), o la altura o el largo máximo (ej. Millepora alcicornis, Porites porites, Acropora cervicornis). Los datos crudos se convirtieron a porcientos relativos de cambio entre el comienzo y el final del estudio (10 meses), con el objetivo de facilitar su comparación. Estos se analizaron a nivel de todas las colonias en cada cuadrante y a nivel de cada especie individual en cada cuadrante para las 7 especies más abundantes entre los fragmentos replantados. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Las especies de fragmentos de corales más abundantes fueron P. porites (30%), M. alcicornis (27%), P. astreoides (9%), Agaricia agaricites (9%), D. strigosa (5%) y A. cervicornis (5%). Las demás especies replantadas presentaban una frecuencia menor de 5% e incluían a M. annularis, Favia fragum, A. palmata, D. labyrinthiformis, Siderastrea siderea, Dendrogyra cylindrus y Meandrina meandrites, f. braziliensis. 

La tasa de sobrevivencia de fragmentos replantados fue de 91% al cabo de 9 meses. Dicha sobrevivenvia se redujo a 79% al cabo de 10 meses debido al desprendimiento mecánico, en particular, de 19% de los fragmentos y a la destrucción total de otro 27%, ambos en el T1, debido a los efectos de pisadas humanas. En el T1, además, se documentó una disminución de 44% en la riqueza original de especies de fragmentos replantados. El restante de la mortalidad de fragmentos (9%) en el T2 y en el T3 se debio a una combinación de desprendimiento natural y a las actividades territorialistas de los peces damiselas (familia Pomacentridae). 

En el T1, se documentó un aumento de 14% en el área superficial de Meandrina meandrites f. braziliensis, y de 11% en Dendrogyra cylindrus. Sin embargo, se documentó una reducción de 18% en el área superficial de Favia fragum y de 100% en Diploria labyrinthiformis. En este último caso, se debió a una infección por la enfermedad de la banda negra. En el T2, se documentaron incrementos significativos en el área superficial de los fragmentos de Millepora alcicornis (67%) y D. strigosa (30%), así como incrementos menores en Agaricia agaricites (8%) y en Montastrea annularis (7%). Sin embargo, se observó una reducción de 7% en un fragmento de Siderastrea siderea. 

En el T3, se documentaron incrementos significativos en el área superficial de los fragmentos de M. annularis (26%) y de Porites astreoides (21%). Sin embargo, se observó una reducción de 17% en los fragmentos replantados de M. alcicornis, principalmente debido a los efectos del sobrecrecimiento de algas filamentosas asociado a la actividad territorialista de las damiselas.

En cuanto a los cambios relativos en la altura máxima, los fragmentos replantados de Acropora cervicornis mostraron, consistentemente, el promedio de crecimiento mayor entre todas las especies en los tres tratamientos, con valores fluctuantes entre 49 y 66%. Un fragmento de A. palmata mostró un incremento de 54% en su altura máxima en el T2. Sin embargo, P. porites mostró una reducción de 33% en su altura máxima en el T1, debido a los efectos de la destrucción mecánica asociada a las pisadas humanas, y de 11% en el T3, debido al sobrecrecimiento por algas filamentosas asociado al territorialismo en las damiselas y debido al desprendimiento natural de algunos fragmentos. 

Igualmente, los fragmentos replantados de A. cervicornis mostraron, consistentemente, el promedio de aumento mayor en su largo máximo entre todas las especies en los dos tratamientos en donde este parámetro se midió, con valores fluctuantes entre 47 y 60%. Así mismo, Porites porites mostró una reducción de 33% en su altura máxima en el T1 y de 20% en el T3, debido a los mismos factores explicados arriba. Sin emabargo, esta especie mostró un aumento de 14% en su largo máximo en el T2. Millepora alcicornis presentó una reducción de entre 5 y 12% en su largo máximo. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Algunos de los fragmentos replantados mostraron una frecuencia alta de daño evidente, creando una diferencia marcada en cuanto a las tasas de crecimiento. En promedio, las colonias libres de daños mostraron un incremento de 33% en la altura, 28% en el largo y de 34% en su área superficial. Las colonias con señales evidentes de daños mostraron una reducción de 72% en la altura, 68% en el largo y de 46% en su área superficial. Esa diferencia se debió a dos factores principalmente, uno natural, el otro de origen antropogénico. En el primer caso, aparte de 9 fragmentos que se desprendieron debido a una posible fijación débil al sustrato, y aparte de una colonia que fue infectada por la enfermedad de la banda negra, la mortalidad natural de fragmentos se debió al sobrecrecimiento por algas filamentosas asociado a la actividad territorialista de las damiselas. Estos peces son herbívoros territorialistas (Tresher, 1976; Itzkowitz, 1977) y pueden matar pólipos de corales al establecer nuevos territorios o expandir los territorios existentes (Kaufman, 1977; Potts, 1977; Lobel, 1980). Además, las damiselas interfieren con el proceso de regeneración de tejido lesionado en corales como Montastrea annularis (Hernández-Delgado, 2000). Se ha observado que la habilidad de regeneración de tejidos en corales transplantados disminuye con el grado de exposición a perturbaciones físicas como el oleaje (Clark, 1997). En este caso, el área de estudios en Bahía Tarja se caracteriza por ser una generalmente protegida del oleaje fuerte, lo que, posiblemente, contribuyó a aumentar la habilidad de regeneración de tejido y la sobrevivencia de los fragmentos. Sin embargo, las damiselas, en altas densidades, pueden causar efectos adversos que incluyen un aumento en la mortalidad de corales por efectos de competencia por interferencia, y el sobrecrecimiento de algas filamentosas debido a un efecto de competencia por pre-ocupación del sustrato (Hernández-Delgado et al. 2000; Hernández-Delgado, 2000). Se ha sugerido que este fenómeno pudiera ser consecuencia indirecta de un efecto de cascada asociado a la sobrepesca en el arrecife de coral (Hernández Delgado, 2000). 

El factor humano causante de la mortalidad de fragmentos fue el caminar sobre el fondo coralino arrecifal. El cuadrante donde se llevó a cabo el tratamiento #1 era una zona impactada ocasionalmente por submarinistas y por entusiastas de la navegación recreacional, quienes amarran sus embarcaciones en dos boyas de amarre localizadas a unos 50 metros de distancia del área de estudios. Durante el feriado del 4 de julio de 2001, dicha localidad recibió una visita inusualmente alta de embarcaciones recreacionales, lo que aumentó significativamente el flujo de personas a través del área de estudios (Rosado Matías, observación personal). El caminar sobre el arrecife de coral ha sido documentado como una de las causales de mortalidad de corales principales en aguas someras sujetas a usos recreacionales intensos (Hawkins y Roberts, 1993).

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: En este estudio, se demostró que los corales fragmentados replantados al fondo de arrecifes someros pueden sobrevivir exitosamente a mediano o a largo plazo, lo suficiente como para posiblemente contribuir a los procesos de reclutamiento locales, y pueden ayudar a aumentar la heterogeneidad espacial del HEP de peces de importancia comercial en sus estadíos juveniles. Esto convierte a los transplantes en una herramienta muy importante en los procesos de restauración de pesquerías arrecifales, particularmente, dentro de Reservas Pesqueras Marinas.
La estrategia de replantar corales fragmentados resultó muy exitosa considerando el por ciento de sobrevivencia ante la ausencia de impactos humanos directos luego de 9 meses (91%), y aún despues de los impactos de las pisadas humanas (79%), al cabo de 10 meses.
Al comparar los resultados de este estudio con los resultados de estudios similares, no se observaron diferencias importantes, lo que sugiere que el método empleado en la Reserva Pesquera Marina del Canal de Luis Peña (RPMCLP) para replantar corales en aguas llanas es uno similar en efectividad y grado de éxito a otros métodos utilizados previamente en otras localidades. Se conoce que la sobrevivencia de fragmentos de corales sueltos en el fondo marino es muy limitada, dependiendo del tipo de sustrato donde se encuentre (Knowlton et al., 1981; Bowden-Kirby, 1997) y que la misma aumenta significativamente al estabilizar los fragmentos (Bowden-Kirby, 1997). Á‰sto sugiere que la estrategia de replantar fragmentos de corales producidos por los efectos del oleaje durante eventos de huracanes o marejadas invernales, o producidos por diversas actividades humanas (ej. caminar sobre el fondo arrecifal, anclaje, encallamientos) debe ser incorporada a cualquier plan de co-manejo en la RPMCLP ya que contribuiría significativamente a aumentar la sobrevivencia de corales juveniles, manteniendo alta la diversidad de especies y la diversidad genética local de corales en aguas someras. También, contribuiría a mantener el potencial de exportación de gametos y larvas hacia otros arrecifes de coral localizados corriente abajo dentro y fuera de la RPMCLP. Más importante aún, la estabilización y alta tasa de sobrevivencia de los fragmentos de corales contribuye significativamente a aumentar la heterogeneidad espacial local de los fondos llanos que constituyen parte del HEP de diversas especies de peces de alto valor comercial en sus estadíos juveniles. Es evidente que las actividades humanas asociadas al caminar sobre el fondo arrecifal llano fue uno de los factores causantes de mortalidad de corales más significativos en este estudio. Como estrategia de manejo para restaurar los arrecifes de la RPMCLP, se recomienda identificar mediante letreros y boyas las entradas seguras al mar, así como iniciar un programa permanente para replantar fragmentos de corales. El mismo podría ser utilizado como una estrategia de educación marina dirigida a los estudiantes en las escuelas de la Isla de Culebra, así como a la comunidad en general, pescadores, visitantes turistas, navegantes recreacionales y a las organizaciones ambientales.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/bangladesh-mangrove-afforestation-programme-of-the-national-forest-department/	Bangladesh: Mangrove Afforestation Programme of the National Forest Department	Bangladesh	1966-09-11	2008-09-11	"The protection from cyclone damage afforded by the Bangladesh Sundarbans mangrove forests, a continuous natural mangrove forest of 5800 km2 in the south-west of Bangladesh, led the Forest Department in 1966 to commence a programme of planting mangroves outside the protective coastal embankments in order to provide greater protection for inhabited coastal areas. These initial mangrove plantings were highly successful and led to the development of a large-scale mangrove afforestation programme. To date, more than 120,000 ha of mangroves have been planted. Nursery and planting techniques have been developed for the major species, while additional species are still being investigated. As a result of the extensive monospecific plantations, however, outbreaks of two major insect pest species have been observed. In addition, a number of other problems were also encountered but in terms of coastal protection and stabilization, wood production and land reclamation, large-scale mangrove afforestation appears to be both technically possible and socio-economically beneficial.Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry As in other parts of the world, mangrove degradation is a growing problem in Bangladesh and is attributable to changes in the physical environment (e.g. changed sedimentary condition, increased salinity, etc.), as well as human encroachment and overexploitation of resources. The focus of this project is not only on rehabilitating these degraded areas, but also using afforestation to create coastal buffer zones for protection against cyclones and tidal surges and to accelerate the accretion of coastal char lands in order to prevent erosion and create more cultivable land. While the initial objective of the afforestation programme was to create a shelter belt to protect the lives and properties of the coastal communities, the early success of the plantations resulted in the setting of additional objectives for coastal afforestation, including to: (a) provide forest products for a range of uses; (b) develop forest shelter-belts to protect life and property inland from tidal surges; (c) inject urgently needed resources into the national economy (i.e. timber and land); (d) create employment opportunities in rural communities; and (e) create an environment for wildlife, fishes, and other estuarine and marine fauna.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Coastal afforestation staff from each district–Patuakhali, Barisal, Noakhali, and Chittagong–have been responsible for establishing mangrove plantations with assistance from local villagers.

Description of Project Activities: From its limited beginnings in 1966, annual plantings of approximately 320 ha (800 acres) of mangroves were undertaken on newly accreted land in the Patuakhali, Barisal, Noakhali and Chittagong coastal districts. These plantations were established by the respective district coastal afforestation staff with assistance from the local villagers. Techniques to raise suitable seedlings and to establish the plantations were developed by 'trial and error'.

Although roughly 27 species of mangroves and a similar number of mangrove associates occur in Bangladesh, most are rare, or of little economic importance. Only 10 or so species occur frequently enough to sustain silviculture.

As a result of the early trial and error approach to plantations, only two species, Sonneratia apetala and Avicennia officinalis, showed encouraging survival rates, and, as a consequence, these two species dominate the mangrove plantations generally as monospecific stands. These species are medium quality timbers used for fuel wood, constructions and furniture. About 80% by area of the early plantations consisted of monospecific stands of S. apetala, about 15% consisted of stands of A. officinalis with the remaining areas consisting of Excoecaria agallocha, Bruguiera spp. and Ceriops decandra, more valuable species for timber or paper pulp production. Polybag culture of a range of other mangrove species has been experimentally developed although field assessments of the performance of these species are as yet incomplete. 

Nursery and planting techniques vary considerably among the various species:

Sonneratia apetala
Mature green fruits of keora (S. apetala) are generally collected during September and they are heaped for 20 days to allow the pericarps to decay. They are then rubbed and washed in water to separate the small seeds from the rotted fleshy portion of the fruits. About 1 kg of green fruit will yield about 275 g or 7500 seeds. These seeds maintain their viability for about one month. Approximately 7-8 kg of these seeds are broadcast onto intertidal nursery beds 1.2m wide and 12m long, slightly raised above the surrounding sediment. The beds are usually encircled by low (15 cm) earthen walls which retain water pumped into the enclosures during unusually dry periods.

Germination onset and success is largely controlled by salinity which needs to be maintained below 20ppt; above 20ppt germination performance declines rapidly.

The seedlings are allowed to grow for about 10 months and from each nursery bed about 2350 seedlings of the desired height (30-60 cm) become available for the next suitable planting season, i.e. from July to August. At this time, the seedlings are gently pulled out of the ground and packed for transport to selected afforestation sites. Generally, one such nursery bed provides sufficient seedlings to plant an area of 0.4 ha at the usual spacing of 1.2 Á— 1.2 m. The uprooted seedlings can be stored in the shade for up to 6 days without any significant losses. As discussed later, this approach results in adequate survival rates for a species that has not been cultivated elsewhere.

Excoecaria agallocha
Seeds of this species ripen in August. The seeds retain their viability for about one month and can either be sown directly onto sheltered intertidal areas, or may be raised in nurseries. Although nursery raising is not used for large plantings, some polybag seedlings are allowed to grow for about 12 months and seedlings of the desired height (30-50 cm) become available for planting from July to August. At this time, the seedlings are packed for transport to afforestation sites where they are usually planted out at a spacing of 1-0 x 1.0 m. One-year-old seedlings may also be collected from the floor of natural forests of the Sundarbans and rapidly transported to planting sites where they are usually planted on relatively raised lands. Because this species is mostly planted onto more raised lands, survival rates using these planting techniques are around 80% after 12 months.

Avicennia oflicinalis
The crypto-viviparous 23 propagules of species of Avicennia are usually collected from around the base of mother trees in August to September. When kept in air, these propagules lose their viability within a few days. These propagules may be directly planted into sheltered areas by 'dibbling'-where the propagule is gently pushed into the soft sediment until firmly wedged. 'Dibbling' is usually undertaken during neap tide periods to allow the seedling to develop roots. Pre-treatment of the propagules has also been used to decrease the establishment time. Such treatment consists of placing the propagules in small nets and exposing them to daily tidal inundation to hasten the decay of the pericarp. Removal of the pericarp by pre-treatment reduces the establishment time to 2-3 days compared with the 5-6 days required where no pretreatment is used. Alternatively, propagules may be raised in nursery beds that are exposed to daily tidal inundation. Seedlings are raised for about 1-2 months after which they are gently pulled out of the ground and packed for transport to afforestation sites where they are usually planted out into holes of 3 cm diameter at a spacing of 1.0 x 1.0 m. Recent experiments using one-year-old seedlings (ranging in height from 70 to 90 cm) raised in nursery beds and planted out at Chittagong and Barisal, showed high survival rates, and may prove to be more suitable for areas where larger seedlings are required. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Because of the highly dynamic nature of the Bangladesh coastline, survival of mangroves is generally poor and replacement planting often needs to be undertaken for up to 3 years. In sheltered localities, however, survival is usually around 70% (see next section). Long-term survival (i.e. between 5 and 15 years) is also highly variable, but in experimental plots at Barisal, survival in 5-year old S. apetala ranged from 29 to 52%. Quantitative data for A. officinalis is still being collated but initial analyses suggest approximately 30-60% survival rates after 5 years in the Chittagong coastal district.

Planting during June to August appears to result in maximum survival of newly planted seedlings of S. apetala based on replicate plots where fixed numbers of seedlings were planted out from nurseries every month over a 24-month period. Cyclical regression analysis of these data shows that not only the time of planting but the age of seedlings is a contributing factor, and that seedlings older than 12 months generally result in lower survival rates for equivalent months.

While quantitative field trials have not yet been carried out with A. officinalis, maximal survival of this species also appears to occur during June to August. In some areas such as the Chittagong and Noakhali Divisions, winter planting is considered to result in higher survival rates but, to date, no experimental data support this view.

At 1.2 x 1.2 m spacing, the trees become congested within 4 or 5 years. In such dense Sonneratia and Avicennia plantations, thinning is carried out after 9-10 years when up to 50% of the stems may be removed. Thinning of these plantations largely consists of removing stunted trees and cutting smaller stems from multi-stemmed trees, and results in slightly reduced natural mortality together with marginal annual increases in height and girth. In more widely spaced plantations, thinning is generally not required because of the relatively slow rate of tree growth and the loss of some trees in plantations due to stem borer attack (see below).

Increases in height and girth, and thus volume, depend on the initial spacing of the particular plantation. In 5-year-old plantations of S. apetala, maximal heights are attained at a spacing of 0.85 x 0.85 m while maximal girth is found in plantations where the initial spacing was 2.4 x 2.4m. Maximal wood production for this species of 18.5m3/ha/year occurs at an initial spacing of 1.2 x 1.2m. With an initial spacing of 1.2 Á— 1.2 m, acceptable volume increments are found in some species throughout the coastal regions. For other genera such as Bruguiera, Ceriops and Xylocarpus, poor growth performance occurs throughout the coastal regions, and is attributable to poor species-to-site matching, particularly in relation to interstitial salinity and tidal inundation. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The mangrove afforestation project in Bangladesh is being carded out in one of the most dynamic natural environments on earth and as such, some problems associated with land stability must be expected and can never be completely eliminated. Four types of land stability problems have been recognized including: burial of mangrove seedlings when and where sediment accretion rates are particularly high; smothering of seedlings by sand in areas where wave action reworks large volumes of sand shorewards; the winnowing of fine sediment (clay and silt) from the plantation site during prolonged stormy periods, leaving a mobile sandy lag deposit; and the erosion of plantation margins through bank slumping by migrating tidal and river channels. All four types of coastal change have caused the loss of mangroves from existing plantations. However, the increasingly systematic identification of areas with land stability problems is being used to avoid planting sites where the risk of crop losses between planting and harvesting is high. In this way, mangrove losses due to adverse coastal changes should be progressively minimized.

Other problems in relation to mangrove plantations have been identified. Over and above the generally difficult communication and logistic conditions in the coastal areas, these problems include unauthorised cattle and buffalo grazing and the illegal occupation of newly raised land by the local villagers for cultivation of rice.

In the mangrove nurseries, one of the initial problems encountered was that heavy rains during the early nursery period caused low seedling production, usually because the seeds are light and easily floated away.

In addition, early planting trials of other mangrove species using the technique where seedlings are pulled out of the ground, did not provide acceptable levels of survival, presumably due to root damage during seedling extraction. The high proportion (about 80% by area) of S. apetala in early plantations is partly due to the tolerance which this species shows toward this transplanting procedure. Polybag culture is now used to raise seedlings of at least 10 different mangrove species for growth trials, and these show much better performance in terms of survival and growth after out-planting. Nevertheless, the extent of the early monospecific plantations has led to outbreaks of two major pest organisms:

Keora stem borers: Zeuzera conferta (Cossidae: Lepidoptera)
Stem borer infestations of S. apetala plantations have increased markedly over the last five years apparently with the increased area of monospecific stands of this species. In I988, a mean of 52% of the trees were affected with 22%, 17% and 13%, respectively, showing severe, moderate or slight infestations. 

Although stem borer attacks generally do not kill the trees, they reduce their timber value, and the Protection Division of the Forest Research Institute is presently trying to develop control measures. At the same time, the PTU is evaluating the silvicultural control of this insect through multi-specific plantations, particularly mixtures of Sonneratia and A vicennia.

Leaf defoliators: Streblote siva (Lasiocampidae: Lepidoptera) 
The numbers of this insect have also increased in apparent response to large monospecific stands of S. apetala. As with the stem borer, this species generally does not kill the trees but severe infestations may cause growth deformities and a marked decline in growth generally and wood production specifically. The silvicultural control of this insect through multi-specific plantations, particularly mixtures of Sonneratia and Avicennia is currently under investigation by the PTU.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: On current estimates, there are some 96,000 ha of suitable coastal lands presently available for further plantations. Despite this, it is estimated that a total of 150,000 ha has been reclaimed and stabilized since the inception of this programme. Considerable areas (60,000 ha) have now become raised to the level where they are no longer suitable for further mangrove plantations and these are currently planted with salt-tolerant upland trees (e.g. Acacia nilotica, Albizia procera, Samanea saman, Casuarina equisettfolia) or have been transferred from the Forest Department to the local people for grazing cattle, goats and buffalo.

More importantly, the protection and stabilization has provided 60,000 ha of stabilized land which at current land values ($US 800/ha), suggests that the real success of the coastal plantations has been to generate 1.44 x 10-9 Takas from new agricultural lands.

In addition, it is estimated that the plantations have provided more than 600,000 m3 of wood (Ishtiaq Uddin Ahmed, Assistant Conservator of Forests, personal communication, 1991) and other forest products, and have provided in excess of 5 Á— 10-6 man days employment for local villagers over the last 25 years, considerably adding to the economies of coastal villages.

During the intense cyclone of April 1991, many of the mangrove plantations were damaged. The intensity of damage was higher along the Chittagong cottst than in the western part of the coastal belt but none of the mangrove nurseries sustained any significant damage. Young plantations (1-5 years old) seemed to have suffered most damage through wave action, with leaf loss ranging from 10 to 80%, By July 1991, however, most of the plantations showed clear signs of recovery (N. A. Siddiqi, unpublished data, 1991), and it is expected that full recovery will occur with the exception of those areas where excessive silt deposition resulted. Damage to non-mangrove species raised on the coastal embankments (such as Acacia nilotica) was significantly higher than that to mangroves, and less developed root systems in non-mangrove species may have contributed to their susceptibility to 'wind-throw'.

Consequently, it may be argued that the most significant benefit provided by the mangrove plantations was the provision of a self-repairing system which facilitated the stabilization and protection of the coast during intense cyclonic conditions.
There are several important lessons emanating from this programme which have wider application. From an ecological management perspective, the major lesson to date has been that monospecific mangrove cultures may develop problems which are difficult and costly to remedy. Where the economic conditions are as they are in Bangladesh, then silvicultural control measures need to be investigated rather than to rely on chemical control measures. More importantly, plantations need to be designed as multispecific systems to minimize or avoid some of the identified problems. In that sense, silvicultural research should precede any intensive planting programme.
In some instances, mangrove plantations have had a sacrificial value, i.e. they have caused such rapid accretion that the land no longer supports mangroves. Because using mangrove plantations to accelerate the accretion of new land is not necessarily compatible with optimal timber production, the objectives for afforestation need to be reviewed and clearly prioritized.
Finally, the changing soil salinities as well as soil maturation of the newly accreted lands require an integrated programme of sequential planting of suitable species which are able to adapt to the changing conditions. In contrast to the existing situation, such an integrated programme requires the long-term control and tenure of the land by the Forest Department.
Despite the improvements that could have been made to this programme at its inception, it has nevertheless proved successful in most respects and illustrated that large-scale mangrove afforestation is both technically possible and socio-economically beneficial. In 1985, the mean yield of wood from 10-year-old plantations was estimated at 200 m3/ha, providing an MAI of 20 m3/ha.
Because of purchaser preference, the price of Sonneratia as fuel wood is approximately 2 Taka ft 3 while other popular fuelwoods are generally priced at 15 Taka ft 3 even though Sonneratia has a slightly higher calorific value (8236Btu/lb) when compared with mango (7886 Btu/lb) and raintree (8191 Btu/lb). Thus, from a purely economic perspective, while the price of Sonneratia as fuel wood remains low, the cost of thinning is barely recoverable. One of the options currently being evaluated is to design the plantations so as to optimize timber productions without the need for thinning.
On the basis of experimental trials it was found that an adjustment of density so that in 5- or 6-year-old plantations, densities of 1100-1600 trees/ha occurred, would result in marginally increased diameter increment, and hence, volume. Such an adjustment of density may be achieved either by thinning when plantations are 5 or 6 years old, or by adjusting the initial spacing so that this density is attained by natural attrition around 5 or 6 years after planting.
If the products of thinning are an important outcome from the coastal plantations, and if these can be harvested economically, then it seems that the current spacing of 1.2m x 1.2m should be retained, with thinning carried out when the plantations are 5 or 6 years old. However, as there is some doubt on the economics of thinning, it may be preferable to adjust the initial spacing to achieve the desired density 5 or 6 years after planting out. An initial spacing of 1.75 m x 1.75 m will result in the desired densities after 5 or 6 years through natural losses and, would thus reduce the initial labour involved in establishing the new plantations. On the other hand, such wider initial spacings would require monitoring to ensure that unforeseen physical events, for example, have not caused major departures from the predicted survival rates. In addition, some infilling may also still be required as mortality may occur in patches rather than randomly through newly established plantations. "

Como parte del monitoreo biológico realizado en el sitio para evaluar la efectividad de la restauración, se estimó el cambio de las coberturas de vegetación y se evaluó la respuesta de las aves acuáticas a la restauración del humedal Palo Verde (Parque Nacional Palo Verde, Guanacaste, Costa Rica) durante el período de julio del 2002 a abril del 2004. Se realizaron entrevistas con actores claves para conocer el uso y manejo tradicional del humedal previo a ser parte un área protegida. Asimismo, se realizó el seguimiento de las actividades de manejo con fangueo, restauración hidrológica, pastoreo, corte de árboles y quemas en la laguna. La cobertura de tifa disminuyó de 35% y 62% a 9% y 7% en las parcelas manejadas con fangueo (1987 y 2002 respectivamente), mientras que en la parcela control el porcentaje de tifa fue siempre mayor a 60% del área total de la parcela. El área de espejo de agua, tifa aplastada, vegetación flotante y emergente y suelo expuesto, aumentó en las parcelas con fangueo y permaneció baja en la parcela control. Un total de 62 especies, que corresponden al 70 % de las aves registradas en la laguna en algún momento, fueron registradas en 32 muestreos en el humedal y se detectaron 12 especies anidando en el humedal, observándose un 30 % en la tifa, 30 % en árboles de Palo Verde y el resto en vegetación flotante, emergente y en tifa aplastada. Las actividades de manejo favorecieron el retorno de las aves acuáticas en las zonas antes cubiertas por masas densas de tifa. Sin embargo, la tifa y los árboles de palo verde han pasado a formar parte del humedal y las actividades de manejo de la laguna deben asegurar la heterogeneidad de ambientes para proveer de las condiciones óptimas para todas las especies que se han registrado haciendo uso del humedal.Agriculture & Livestock, Climate Change, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry En los tiempos en que Palo Verde era parte de la hacienda Comelco, se mantenía ganado en los humedales y en las zonas menos profundas. Aparentemente, el número de animales varió con el correr de los años. Se contabilizaron 12.000 cabezas de ganado marcado en el año 1924 y en el período de 1943 a 57 habían aproximadamente 8000 vacas en la subfinca PV (López R. com. pers.). Los animales que pastoreaban en el humedal se movían libremente entre los humedales y durante la época seca cuando el agua escaseaba, se concentraban en las lagunas o los ojos de agua. Algunos permanecían todo el año en las lagunas alimentándose de vegetación acuática (pastos – Paspalidium sp. y Hymenachme sp.-, retoños de tifa, retoños de palo verde y algunas plantas acuáticas como Neptunia sp.).
Desde el momento en que la zona se convirtió en área protegida, cambios de manejo, infraestructura y accesos entre otros ocurrieron (Calvo y Arias 2004, González E. com. pers., McCoy 2002). Primeramente, se sacó casi todo el ganado de los humedales y se cortó con el manejo por pastoreo que se realizaba antes (McCoy 1996, Vaughan et al. 1996). Muchos sitios tanto boscosos como humedales se vieron afectados por la reducción en las prácticas de manejo tradicionales (Vaughan et al. 1996).
Vaughan et al. (1996), mencionaron que el estero Chamorro se comenzó a secar cuando se expropió la hacienda en los años 80 porque se dejó de realizar la limpieza de los mismos y el manejo del agua en la época seca. Recientemente se ha sugerido que la construcción del camino hacia puerto Chamorro en 1980, fue la acción que cortó el flujo natural del estero y de la quebrada Huertón, que desembocaban en la laguna y brindaba agua de escorrentía en la época seca (Calvo y Arias 2003). Se estima en alrededor de 350 ha el área de la cuenca del Huertón el cual drenaba en el estero Chamorro y luego en el río Tempisque (aproximadamente 1.750.000 m3).
Asimismo, cambios en las precipitaciones totales anuales para la cuenca del río Tempisque se dieron de acuerdo a períodos secos con menos de la media (1798 mm para la cuenca y alrededor de 1200 -1500 mm para PV (OTS y UICN 2005, Vaughan et al 1982). Asimismo, a partir de 1980 el Ministerio de Ambiente y Energía (MINAE) otorgó concesiones para la toma del agua del río Tempisque en alrededor de 8 m3/s, lo que produjo que el caudal medio del río disminuyera a solo 7 % del caudal natural (OTS y UICN 2005).
Algunos investigadores creen que el ganado manejaba las comunidades vegetales en la laguna por medio del pastoreo y el pisoteo principalmente (Barboza 1999, McCoy 1994, McCoy y Rodríguez 1994, Vaughan et al. 1996). Otros autores sin embargo, creen que una combinación de la falta del manejo con ganado, cambios en la hidrología de la laguna y la ocurrencia de años bastante secos con precipitaciones menores al total anual medio, fue lo que desencadenó que la calidad de los ecosistemas bajara drásticamente y la tifa invadiera el humedal (Calvo y Arias 2004, González 2004, OTS y UICN 2005) creciendo en forma colonial a una tasa de 9 m de diámetro por estación de crecimiento (McCoy y Rodríguez 1994). El humedal Palo Verde, junto con los otros humedales de la cuenca baja del río Tempisque, ha sido de los más importantes en Centro América para las poblaciones de aves residentes y migratorias que se han concentrado de septiembre a abril en estas áreas para alimentarse y descansr principalmente (Boza 1981, Boza y Mendoza 1981, McCoy y Rodríguez 1994, Meza 1991, Sánchez 1985). Más de 60 especies de aves acuáticas han utilizado el humedal, tales como los patos migratorios, nidificantes en América del Norte (e.g. -pato calvo- (Anas americana), -pato rabudo- (Anas acuta), -cerceta aliazul- (Anas discors) -pato cuchara- (Anas clypeata), numerosos limícolas, -garzón azul- (Ardea herodias), y -águila pescadora- (Pandion haliaetus).
Es asimismo de gran importancia para especies residentes, e.g -jabirú o galán sin ventura- (Jabiru mycteria), -piche- (Dendrocygna autumnalis), -pato real- (Cairina moschata), -gavilán caracolero- (Rostrhamus sociabilis), así como para las 15 especies de aves coloniales, en su mayoría garzas que nidifican en Isla de Pájaros en el río Tempisque (Vaughan et al. 1996). El Bajo Tempisque es especialmente importante para especies que se reproducen en la época seca, como la -espátula rosada (Ajaia ajaja) y -alcaraván- (Burhinus bistriatus) (Ramsar 2000b; Mateo 2001).
Antes de 1980, se observaban nubes de piches y cercetas y grandes cantidades de otros patos migratorios. Se podían observar más de 60 galanes, miles de espátulas, y más de 5000 garzones, varias especies de patos (se cazaban por año alrededor de 200 Anas acuta), (Steward D. com. pers.). Algunos patos cuchara (Anas clypeata) aparecían con anillos en las patas y miles de garzas de distintas especies podían ser observadas ocasionalmente (López R. com. pers., Ruiz E. com. pers.y Torres J. com. pers.). Para el año 1979 durante la estación seca y en un solo conteo, se observaron hasta 30.000 piches, 25.000 cercetas y un gran número de patos cuchara. Adicionalmente, era común observar cientos de cigueñones (Mycteria americana), más de 700 espátulas rosadas y algunos jabirúes (McCoy 1996, McCoy y Rodríguez 1994, Sánchez 1985, Vaughan et al. 1996).
La naturaleza estacional de la laguna, su topografía y la profundidad del agua son los factores que condicionan la presencia de vegetación (Vaughan et al. 1996). De 0 a 40 cm se pueden encontrar árboles de Palo Verde y especies como por ejemplo Eleocharis sp. entre otras; de 40 a 80 cm se pueden encontrar zacates y tifa y en profundidades mayores solo especies flotantes o flotantes arraigadas (McCoy com. pers.).
Hacia el inicio de la estación lluviosa, por ejemplo, crece la vegetación acuática flotante con especies como Nymphaea ampla, Neptunia plena y Eichornia crassipes, (flotantes – no arraigada), dominando en áreas con espejos de agua. Otras áreas de la laguna están dominadas por la vegetación emergente, ciperáceas, poáceas y especies flotantes que forman grandes enmarañados y flotan juntas, y otras plantas invasoras como la tifa (Typha domingensis) y la talia (Thalia geniculata). También se encuentran algunas especies sumergidas. Asimismo, se pueden observar árboles y arbustos distribuidos principalmente en aguas poco profundas y a lo largo del borde pantanoso, siendo el mas notable el palo verde, palmas y otras leguminosas (Crow 2002). Al comenzar la época seca las plantas acuáticas y semiacuáticas comienzan a morir. Al inicio de la época lluviosa, germinan las especies cuyas semillas, bulbos o rizomas se encuentran en el banco de especies establecido en la laguna (Ramsar 2000b, Rizo-Patrón et al. Datos no publicados). La meta del proyecto de restauración de la laguna Palo Verde ha sido mejorar el hábitat para favorecer la llegada de las aves acuáticas residentes y migratorias, el aumento de las poblaciones de aves y reducir el área ocupada por tifa.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Inicialmente, la zona de estudio incluyó dos parcelas de manejo: A (1987) y C (Control), cada una de aproximadamente 80 ha de superficie y de forma rectangular limitada por cercas establecidas para controlar principalmente al ganado (en el caso de la 1987 y en el costado oeste de la 2002). La parcela 1987, fue manejada desde ese año en forma experimental con métodos mecánicos tales como corte con machete a mano o con segadora con tractor agrícola, quema (asociado al fangueo), diferentes tasas de pastoreo, estas últimas técnicas combinadas y fangueo (McCoy y Rodríguez 1994). La parcela Control no recibió manejo activo con tractor ni con otros métodos. En septiembre del 2002, la parcela Control definida al comienzo, fue quemada y fangueada y paso a ser la parcela B (2002). Es necesario mencionar que parte de la parcela 2002, fue fangueada en el año 91, pero en 3 años volvió a cerrarse con tifa nuevamente (McCoy M. com. pers.). La parcela Control fue nuevamente delimitada aledaña a la parcela 2002 (anterior parcela control). 

Manejo Mecánico: 

--Fangueo y quemas-- 
El fangueo fue realizado con tractores con ruedas de hierro en la parte trasera y consistió en aplastamiento y corte indirecto de masas de tifa homogéneas bajo el agua. Las actividades de fangueo se realizaron en dos períodos para cada año, al principio de la época lluviosa y al comienzo de la seca cuando la profundidad de agua baja a un punto óptimo para que el tractor ingrese (35-40 cm). EL fangueo en época lluviosa es más efectivo porque el nivel de la laguna comienza a aumentar y cubre los brotes de tifa que crecen con las primeras lluvias (mayo) o los tallos dañados por el tractor (Mc Coy com. pers.).

Durante este estudio se fanguearon alrededor de 180 ha en la laguna en las parcelas 1987 (desde julio del 2002) y 2002 (desde septiembre del 2002) mientras que en la parcela control no se realizó fangueo. Inicialmente se habían planeado fanguear (aplastar) alrededor de 200 ha de tifa. Sin embargo, como el manejo con el tractor depende de la profundidad de la laguna y ante la imposibilidad de entrar en algunas zonas, el área afectada por el fangueo fue mayor por la necesidad de extenderse a zonas en donde el nivel de agua permitió la entrada del tractor. Para abril del 2004 se habían manejado alrededor de 320 ha de la laguna.

Generalmente se realizaron 2 pasadas por encima de las masas de tifa. Sin embargo, en algunos lugares solo se necesitó fanguear una vez y en otros hasta 3 veces debido a la densidad de esta planta. De esta forma, se realizaron acciones de fangueo durante los meses de julio-septiembre del 2002. En octubre y noviembre, la laguna tuvo un nivel alto de agua (valor medio de 95.4 cm), con lo que se impidió la entrada del tractor. Luego a partir de diciembre se volvió a entrar en algunos sectores. En enero del 2003 se reanudaron las actividades y se continuaron hasta marzo de ese año. Sin embargo, el fangueo fue menos intenso con respecto al año 2002, debido a que el área de tifa ya se había reducido considerablemente (alrededor de nueve y siete % del área total para las parcelas 1987 y 2002). Luego en mayo-junio se realizaron algunas entradas en las zonas donde había tifa y la profundidad de la laguna permitió la entrada del tractor. Por último, en el 2004 se fangueo desde enero hasta marzo. 

Las quemas realizadas durante este estudio fueron realizadas para reducir la biomasa de tifa acumulada por años y facilitar la entrada del tractor en la zona a fanguear. En septiembre del 2002 en la parcela 2002, la cual fue quemada casi completamente. Luego de esta acción el tractor pudo entrar con mayor facilidad, sin embargo, la zona quemada volvió a tener brotes de tifa en 17 días. En mayo del 2003, se realizó otra quema abarcando alrededor de 200 ha dentro y fuera de las parcelas evaluadas y fue concentrada principalmente en parches con tifa seca que no se había matado con el tractor. Se realizaron algunos recorridos por la zona quemada para evaluar el impacto de las quemas sobre la vida silvestre estivante (Castañeda F. com pers., Obs. Pers.).

--Corte de Árboles en el Borde de la Laguna-- 
Se realizó la corta de los árboles que se encontraban en el borde de la laguna frente a las parcelas 1987 y 2002 en febrero del 2003. Posteriormente fueron acumulados y quemados para reducir la cantidad de material residual (Fig. 9 y 10). Estas actividades se realizaron con el objetivo de restaurar los márgenes de la laguna que fueron colonizadas por distintas especies de árboles. Sin embargo, se dejaron algunos ejemplares de árboles maderables e importantes para el área tales como el Guayacán real -Guaiacum sanctum-, el ron ron- Astronium graveolens-, el gallinazo  -  Schizolobium parahyba- y el jobo  - Spondias mombin. Las especies cortadas fueron el michigÁ¼iste  - Pithecellobium lanceolatum- y algunos árboles de jobo y gallinazo. Se dejaron los márgenes casi completamente libres de vegetación arbustiva y arbórea, como se encontraba en los años 70.

--Corte de Árboles de Palo Verde--
Las actividades de manejo planeadas en el proyecto de restauración de acuerdo al plan de manejo (Vaughan et al. 1996) incluían la remoción de parte de los árboles de palo verde que habían avanzado en la laguna. En mayo del 2003, se realizó el corte de todos los árboles de palo verde existentes en la parcela 1987 (6.8 ha) y el resto de la parcela 2002 abarcando un área total de 13.5 ha de árboles de palo verde cortados. 

--Restauración mecánica de la Quebrada Huertón y de la conexión del Estero Chamorro con la Laguna Palo Verde--
Se restituyó el flujo original de la Quebrada Huertón hacia el humedal Palo Verde por medio de la construcción de un canal sin vegetación de aproximadamente 200 m de largo y 5 de ancho para redirigir el cauce. Además, se reemplazaron las alcantarillas del camino para permitir el paso del agua. Por otro lado, se restituyó el flujo de agua proveniente de los cerros aledaños y del humedal Piedras Blancas hacia el estero Chamorro, y se colocó una compuerta para medir la entrada de agua a la laguna. Se realizó el seguimiento del monitoreo de niveles de agua y caudal aportado por la Quebrada Huertón y el Estero Chamorro, durante el año 2003-04 (Calvo y Arias 2003).

Manejo Bovino: 

--Pastoreo con Ganado-- 
De acuerdo a la información recopilada, para el año 2003, existían 14 concesiones de ganado en el parque. Sin embargo, actualmente (2005) existen 11 concesiones con ganado para cría. Solo dos de las concesiones se superpusieron con las parcelas de muestreo seleccionadas con un total de 692 animales (Matarrita com. pers.)

Los animales son mantenidos en el humedal desde Enero a Agosto y cuando la profundidad de la laguna sobrepasa el límite para los animales se los retira y se los lleva a otro lugar (Calvo H. com. pers.). Cada ganadero, firma un contrato en el que se compromete a reparar y mantener las cercas establecidas en la laguna y a paga el total de Â¢ 400 por cabeza de ganado y por mes. Sin embargo, las cercas que se encuentran dentro limitando cada parcela y algunas internas no se encuentran en el mejor estado y se pueden observar como algunos animales se pasan de un lado a otro.

Monitoreo:

Para registrar el cambio de la vegetación durante las actividades de restauración a modo descriptivo, se tomaron fotografías panorámicas con una cámara digital, desde los dos miradores en cada día de conteo de aves.

Las observaciones de las aves residentes y/o migratorias se realizaron en las parcelas 1987 (A), 2002 (B) y Control (C) definidas anteriormente, durante las estaciones secas y lluviosas desde julio del 2002 hasta abril del 2004 cada 15-20 días aproximadamente. Las observaciones de aves en la parcela 1987 fueron realizadas desde el mirador Guayacán (Cerro del mismo nombre) y las de las parcelas 2002 y Control desde el mirador La Roca (Cerro Guayacancito) al día siguiente con un telescopio 20-60 X (Swarovski, Ontario, CA).  

Los conteos se realizaron mediante el barrido completo de cada parcela, de izquierda a derecha y de adelante hacia atrás (Scan sampling), en cada parcela realizando un conteo cada hora aproximadamente. De esta forma, se obtuvieron cinco conteos, entre las 6:00 y las 11:00 hs, para cada muestreo y por parcela a lo largo del estudio. Por medio del muestreo instantáneo de cada individuo (Martin y Bateson 2001), en cada conteo se registraron todas las especies de aves observables, el número de individuos de cada una de ellas, el tipo de cobertura en que se encontraba cada individuo y el tipo de comportamiento que presentaba en el momento del muestreo (Colin et al. 1993, Fisher et al. 1982, Martin y Bateson 2001, Ralph 1996). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: --El Fangueo en el Humedal como Herramienta de Manejo--
Las actividades de fangueo de la tifa en el humedal Palo Verde, favorecieron la diversidad de hábitats, que en parte era mantenida por el ganado por medio del pastoreo (Mc Coy y Rodríguez 1994). Además, favorecieron el aumento de la riqueza de especies vegetales puesto que se encontraron 62 especies de plantas en las parcelas con fangueo en comparación con solo 19 encontradas en la parcela control (Trama et al. 2004).

De acuerdo a los análisis descriptivos y cuantitativos, se desprende que el manejo de la laguna ha producido una reducción en la cobertura de tifa y un aumento por medio del reestablecimiento de otras coberturas vegetales tales como plantas emergentes, plantas flotantes, así como también zonas con espejos de agua y suelo expuesto. Es necesario continuar con las acciones de manejo para mantener la heterogeneidad de ambientes en la laguna y controlar el avance de las especies invasoras.

Las fotografías digitales tomadas cada 15 días, mostraron una reducción del área ocupada por la tifa (de 35% a 9% en la parcela 1987 y de 62% a 7% en la 2002) y la aparición de otras coberturas vegetales (las cuales variaron de 5 a 33% en la parcela 1987 y de 0.4 a 18% en la 2002), de espejo de agua y de suelo expuesto de acuerdo a la estacionalidad de la laguna y a las actividades de restauración. Por otro lado, el análisis cuantitativo de las fotografías e imágenes permitió registrar cómo el área manejada con fangueo (tifa aplastada) aumentó a lo largo de las actividades de manejo en un 31% y un 59% en las parcelas 1987 y 2002, respectivamente. 

--Restauración Hidrológica y Factores Ambientales--
Durante este estudio, la precipitación total anual del año 2002 (1041.2 mm) se encontró por debajo de la media registrada para el sitio. Esto implicó que la laguna se secara en marzo del 2002 (período 2002-3), en comparación con el período 2003-4 en el cual se observó agua hasta abril y la precipitación anual fue de 1400 mm. En el año 2004-5 la precipitación total anual fue mucho menor (866 mm) lo que permitió solo una profundidad máxima en el punto PP de 1.15 m. Esta diferencia de 15 cm de agua en toda la laguna implica una menor área inundada y la posibilidad para que las especies que se quieren controlar puedan extenderse a zonas menos profundas. El hecho de que la precipitación total haya sido baja implicó no solo un aporte menor por agua de lluvia directa, sino también a partir de los afluentes provenientes de los cerros cercanos (entre estos Quebrada Huertón y Chamorro) (Calvo y Arias Datos no publicados). 

La restauración de la Quebrada Huertón, que brinda agua desde los cerros aledaños y la conexión del estero Chamorro que trae agua desde el humedal Piedra Blanca, de cerros aledaños y posiblemente del río Tempisque, permitió el llenado de la laguna de una forma más acelerada. Es necesario aclarar que el humedal tiene un límite de volumen de agua que puede almacenar, mas allá de ese valor comienza a descargar hacia el río Tempisque, principalmente. De esta forma, el agua entrante a raíz de la restauración de los cauces, no implicó un nivel de agua más alto en la laguna, si no que permitió que el año hidrológico fuera más extenso en el año 2003 con respecto al 2002, inundando una mayor cantidad de terreno en menor tiempo y el secado del humedal en forma más lenta (Calvo y Arias 2003). De esta forma, la restauración de los cauces no cambió la estacionalidad de la laguna, solo permitió la llegada del agua que se había bloqueado anteriormente, lo que intenta reestablecer alguna de las condiciones previas a las modificaciones. 

Luego de estas acciones en el año 2003-2004, los retoños de tifa que crecieron con las primeras lluvias quedaron inundados y no todos lograron crecer más rápido que lo que subió el nivel de agua por lo que la cantidad de tifa que creció en el año 2003 fue menor (Trama et al. 2004). Esto coincide con la literatura que menciona que una menor densidad de tifa fue observada en áreas inmediatamente inundadas, al comienzo de la época lluviosa la cual coincide con la de crecimiento de los retoños de tifa (Lee et al. 1996, Ponzio et al. 2004, Urban et al. 1993). De esta forma, la tifa podría ser controlada en parte por medio del manejo del hábitat, en este caso el manejo hidrológico.

--Riqueza de Especies--
Los resultados obtenidos en este trabajo indican que las aves acuáticas en general respondieron de una forma positiva a las actividades de restauración realizadas en la Laguna Palo Verde y que el hábitat está en proceso de recuperación. Esto se evidencia en el gran número de especies de aves observadas, el cuál corresponde a mas del 70% de las registradas alguna vez en la laguna (Vaughan et al. 1996). La abundancia de piches alcanzó valores mayores a los observados para la laguna en años anteriores y se estimaron 3600 garzones, un número muy alentador, teniendo en cuenta que se observaban miles cuando el área era parte de la hacienda y cientos cuando ya era parque nacional. Las garzas blancas y garcitas del ganado fueron observadas de a cientos y el número de jabirúes fue mas que alentador sabiendo que en el pasado los sabaneros observaban a mas de 50 individuos. En cambio, las cercetas no alcanzaron el máximo observado para la laguna y el número registrado en los 70 para las espátulas rosadas en la laguna, no fue alcanzado tampoco. Solo fueron observadas 6 de las 11 especies de anatidas reportadas para el sitio (Vaughan et al. 1996).

Si bien el número observado de piches en febrero del 2004 (alrededor de 23.000 en un solo conteo) y cercetas (alrededor de 6000) en la parcela 1987, no alcanzó los valores registrados para la laguna en el año 1979, es necesario tener en cuenta que fuera de las parcelas estudiadas se observaron alrededor de 6000 piches y 4500 cercetas más. De esta forma, los individuos contabilizados dentro y fuera de las parcelas establecidas se acercan aún más al número de individuos mencionados para el pasado en la laguna (McCoy y Rodríguez 1994, Sánchez et al. 1985). Por otro lado, es necesario tener en cuenta que las aves no permanecen estáticas en un sitio y pueden moverse desde sus sitios de colonia miles de kilómetros entre las épocas de anidación (Duncan et al. 1999, Frederick et al. 1996, Haig et al. 1997, Kushland 1986, Paillisson et al. 2002), por lo que probablemente las aves observadas en el mes de enero pueden no ser las mismos individuos que se observaron 30 días después. De esta forma, es importante tener en cuenta que los valores reales del número de individuos que utilizarían este humedal, serían mayores a los calculados al considerar la laguna en su totalidad y en todo el período de migración.

El aumento del número de individuos de algunas especies raras tales como el pato cuchara, el águila pescadora, el pato enmascarado, varias especies de playeritos y gaviotas entre otros, además de la observación de 44 individuos juntos de Jabirú (del cuál se contaron 66 ind. juntos en los humedales de Guanacaste (Villareal com. pers.) y 2 de halcón peregrino vistos recurrentemente con comportamientos de alimentación, permiten decir que el humedal estaría presentando condiciones similares a las observadas antes de la invasión de tifa y a los cambios hidrológicos ocurridos en la laguna. Por otro lado, el registro del número de aves fue similar o mayor al observado en la laguna en años anteriores para algunas especies (Apéndice C) (McCoy 1994 y 1996, Solís 2002, Sánchez 2000, Ducks Unlimited 2004) o para otros humedales (Herremans 1999). En enero del 2005 se contabilizaron mas de 35.000 piches y alrededor de 9000 cercetas para toda la laguna, lo que indicaría que las acciones de restauración siguen mejorando las condiciones para la llegada de mayor cantidad de aves acuáticas (Obs. pers.). De esta forma, se puede decir que la integridad biológica y el valor ecológico del humedal se estaría recuperando, de acuerdo a la ocurrencia y el número de especies e individuos de aves acuáticas que se encuentran en el sitio y que representan un alto valor de conservación (Paillisson et al. 2002).

El registro de más del doble del número de especies de aves en las parcelas con fangueo con respecto a la parcela control, demostró que es necesario recuperar y mantener el humedal en condiciones de heterogeneidad de hábitats controlando la tifa. Por otro lado, la parcela control no estuvo compuesta solo por tifa sino también por otros tipos de cobertura en donde fueron observadas 10 de las 22 especies para esa parcela. De esta forma, si se toman en cuenta solo las especies que utilizaron tifa (12), la diferencia en riqueza y abundancia de individuos en parcelas con y sin fangueo es mayor. Esto implicaría que la tifa como tipo de cobertura vegetal es utilizada por menos especies en comparación con los otros tipos de cobertura. Además, es necesario aclarar que todas las especies de aves registradas en la tifa de la parcela control también fueron observadas en otras coberturas vegetales y en las otras dos parcelas. Con esto se puede decir que al haber manejado por mas tiempo la parcela 1987 se favoreció una mayor riqueza de especies y abundancia de individuos, que en la parcela 2002 y que en la control en la que no se realizo fangueo. 

Se registraron nidos de 12 especies de aves residentes en los distintos tipos de cobertura vegetal definidos, siendo 4 de ellas no acuáticas. Inclusive luego de haber sido cortados los árboles de palo verde dentro de la parcela 1987 y 2002 se observaron garcitas verdes anidando en ellos. Se registraron ocho especies anidando en la parcela 1987 y en seis tipos de coberturas vegetales diferentes; ocho especies en la parcela 2002 y en cinco tipos de coberturas vegetales y tres especies en la parcela Control, en solo tres tipos de coberturas. Se puede observar que tres de las especies utilizaron la cobertura TA como sustrato para anidar. Es importante destacar que el 30% de los nidos registrados se encontraron en árboles de palo verde, antes o después de ser cortados y otro 30 % en la zona con tifa. Sin embargo, la mitad de los registros en tifa fueron de dos especies de aves no acuáticas (Agelaious phoeniceus y Crotophaga sulcirostris).

La riqueza de especies (REME) fue mayor en la época seca con respecto a la lluviosa coincidiendo con lo esperado por existir una profundidad optima (X= 20 cm) para una mayor cantidad de aves acuáticas. Sin embargo, las interacciones observadas entre las parcelas de muestreo y la época del año (seca y lluviosa), revelan que las especies responden a la estacionalidad de la laguna y al período del año de una forma diferente en cada parcela. En la parcela 1987 se observó una mayor riqueza con respecto a la parcela 2002, lo cual podría estar implicado por la mayor heterogeneidad observada durante el período de estudio como resultado de la historia de manejo más extensa en la primer parcela con respecto a la segunda. Por el contrario en la parcela control no se observaron diferencias significativas revelando que la respuesta de las aves en esta parcela no depende de la estacionalidad sino del tratamiento de manejo. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Las quemas en época seca propician el retorno de los nutrientes en la laguna y si la lluvia no es abundante a principio de la época lluviosa para cubrir la vegetación que esta creciendo, lo único que hace el fuego es liberar al sitio de la biomasa vieja y abonar el terreno. En el 2003, la quema realizada en mayo, coincidió con un período posterior de lluvias de más de 500 mm (Mayo y Junio) siendo la total 1400 mm. En el año 2004, luego de realizar una quema en la laguna, solo se registraron 220 mm de lluvia en los mismos meses (mayo y junio) siendo la precipitación total para ese año de 866 mm. De esta forma, las lluvias no fueron suficientemente fuertes y duraderas y dio tiempo a la vegetación para que creciera por encima del agua. El realizar quemas en la época seca esperando que las lluvias sean lo suficientemente fuertes y constantes como para manejar la vegetación creciente, es muy arriesgado. Además, se ha reportado que el calor durante la quema no es lo suficientemente intenso como para impedir la función o viabilidad del rizoma de la tifa (Sodja y Solberg 1993). 

No es recomendable utilizar el fuego como una herramienta de manejo para este género cuando el nivel del agua no puede ser controlado estrictamente (Sodja y Solberg 1993, Newman et al.1996, Newman et al.1998). Por otro lado, una quema aunque sea controlada, siempre implica riesgos para los alrededores de la zona quemada y los organismos estivantes (Vaughan et al. 1996). Hay animales (principalmente tortugas, serpientes, sapos, ratones e invertebrados) que se refugian en los parches secos de tifa en la época seca (Castañeda 2003, Obs. Pers), cuando frecuentemente se realizan las quemas para reducir la biomasa de la misma. Luego de la quema del 2003, se encontraron 21 y 23 individuos muertos de la tortuga Kinosternon scorpioides por hectárea en las zonas donde se había manejado la tifa y en la zona donde había tifa en pie todavía, demostrando la importancia de esta cobertura para organismos estivantes. Asimismo, se encontraron ratones, serpientes, insectos y otros invertebrados quemados (Castañeda 2003). Sin embargo, en el año 2004 la quema solo se realizó en parches con tifa manejada y se quemó a contraviento. De esta forma se dio tiempo a los animales para escapar del fuego o por lo menos a asomarse entre a tifa aplastada para ser rescatados (Obs. pers.).
–La restauración con fangueo favoreció la heterogeneidad de coberturas de vegetación, espejo de agua y suelo expuesto.
–La reducción del área ocupada por tifa y la variedad de coberturas de vegetación, suelo expuesto y espejo de agua (época seca), favoreció el retorno de las aves acuáticas.
–La presencia de aves depende de la profundidad y la estacionalidad de la laguna.
–Las aves evitaron la cobertura de tifa en todas las parcelas y prefirieron las coberturas bajas (Espejo de agua, vegetación flotante, tifa aplastada y suelo expuesto).
–La tifa y el palo verde brindaron hábitat de anidación y descanso a algunas especies de aves acuáticas, por lo tanto son coberturas necesarias en la laguna.
–Las aves necesitan heterogeneidad de coberturas vegetales para cumplir con todas sus actividades.
–La estacionalidad sincronizaría la presencia y movimientos de las aves entre los humedales de la cuenca baja del río Tempisque.
–El ganado es necesario para mantener controlados los pastos que crecen luego de que la tifa es aplastada y en la época lluviosa temprana.
–La redirección de las aguas de la Quebrada Huertón y Chamorro hacia la laguna Palo Verde posiblemente ayudó a controlar la vegetación emergente al principio de la época lluviosa del 2003. –Fangueo de la Tifa–
Se considera que la tifa es una cobertura que ha pasado a formar parte del humedal Palo Verde. Por lo tanto, se recomienda seguir con el método de fangueo para matar la tifa dejando algunas zonas para que las aves y otra vida silvestre la utilice de acuerdo a sus requerimientos.
Se debe concentrar el fangueo en zonas con tifa o vegetación emergente alta y no en zonas con vegetación flotante y ciperáceas. Tampoco se debe fanguear en verano con poca agua (menos de 35 cm) debido a que pueden formarse islas flotantes de tifa, que no pueden ser fangueadas por su carácter flotante, lo que implica además la necesidad de realizar una quema en la época seca siguiente.
A pesar que este trabajo consistió en la evaluación de la restauración en un solo sitio, es de suponer que los resultados puedan ser similares en otros humedales dentro del parque tales como La Bocana y Nicaragua que tienen problemas de invasión de tifa. Teniendo en cuenta esto y la situación en cada uno de estos humedales, se recomienda la evaluación de posibles acciones de manejo activo con fangueo, para favorecer la recuperación de estos humedales y la conservación de la vida silvestre asociada. De esta forma, el realizar actividades de restauración a diferentes escalas (Edwin 1999) para recuperar otros humedales tanto dentro como fuera del parque nacional aumentaría la probabilidad de conservación de las aves acuáticas y sus hábitats.
–Quemas en el Humedal–
Se recomienda no realizar quemas en el humedal por los riesgos que implica para la vida silvestre y por el aporte rápido de nutrientes al humedal que podrían resultar en un crecimiento acelerado no deseado de la vegetación emergente y la tifa. Solo cuando la tifa es muy densa y cuando la quema se realiza de forma muy controlada, como primera acción de manejo antes del fangueo, puede ser necesario realizar para reducir la tifa acumulada por años. Sin embargo, en la laguna de Palo Verde pocas zonas quedan sin haber sido manejadas aunque sea una vez, por lo que no se recomienda realizar quemas en estos sectores.
–Manejo de los Árboles de Palo Verde–
De acuerdo a lo observado en este estudio y a lo mencionado por Hurtado (2003), la cobertura de árboles de palo verde es utilizada por las aves residentes para descanso y reproducción en la época lluviosa sobre todo. Por este motivo, es necesario recuperar algunas zonas con árboles rodeados con agua, lugares al parecer preferidos por las aves por ofrecer aislamiento y protección contra depredadores.
–Manejo de la Hidrología de la Laguna–
Se recomienda seguir realizando los monitoreos de entrada y salida de agua del humedal Palo Verde, así como también de los humedales cercanos que estén conectados sobre todo en la época lluviosa (Chamorro, Piedra Blanca y posiblemente Varillal). Por otro lado, se recomienda realizar la topografía del resto del humedal Palo Verde y limpiar los esteros Chamorro y Manzanillo que actualmente se encuentran sedimentados y cubiertos con vegetación.
–Pastoreo con Ganado–
Actualmente, la carga de animales no es la recomendable (3,5-5 animales por ha), por lo que la delimitación de zonas prioritarias es de gran necesidad si se quiere aprovechar el control que el ganado realiza de las plantas acuáticas, tifa y pastos emergentes. Para esto se sugieren algunas actividades:
–Reparar y/o mantener las cercas que separan los potreros delimitados en la laguna Palo Verde.
–Se recomienda la subdivisión de los potreros existentes y la rotación de los animales por períodos de 2 a 4 meses en cada sector. Es decir, que por ejemplo en vez de mantener los animales por 8 meses en todo el potrero, se mantendría en la mitad o en una cuarta parte, durante 4 meses. Además, es necesario incluir zonas altas para el descanso de los animales en cada sub-parcela.
–Delimitar zonas prioritarias y épocas para el pastoreo (que presenten gramíneas, ciperáceas y tifa). Intensificar en algunas épocas como por ejemplo al inicio época lluviosa donde la vegetación comienza a crecer y a incrementar su densidad. "

En Laguna de Cabildo se sembraron 19 345 hipocótilos durante el periodo de junio a agosto. Posteriormente, en septiembre del año 2000, en Laguna de Pozuelos se plantaron 3 019 propágulos. Después de 240 días las plántulas alcanzaron más de 61.5 cm y 65.0 cm de altura en los dos sitios, respectivamente. Al final del experimento en las dos lagunas sobrevivieron 15 709 plántulas. La mayor mortalidad (61.2%) se registró en Laguna de Cabildo durante los meses de febrero-abril cuando el lugar se secó completamente. Por el contrario, en el segundo sitio la inundación permanente permitió una sobrevivencia inicial de más de 98.5%, incluso la marea arraigó una cantidad mayor de propágulos, esto al final incrementó la cantidad de plantas inicialmente germinadas. Hasta 550 propágulos se germinaron en un vivero, estas plantas después de 120 días se llevaron al campo, donde registraron una mortalidad menor al 5% y una altura de 71.77 cm.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry En la década de 1980 se construyó un canal que conectaba Laguna de Cabildo con la dársena de Puerto Madero; esto cambio fuertemente la hidrología de la laguna. Aunado a esto, durante la construcción de una granja camaronera, se edificó un bordo para separar la granja de la laguna, aumentando aún más el grado de disturbio sobre el sistema. En la actualidad, para retener cierto volumen de agua en la laguna durante los meses de estiaje, ha sido necesario colocar sobre el canal una compuerta. Laguna de Cabildo constituye una importante zona de alimentación, refugio y reproducción de una gran variedad de aves residentes, así como de aves acuáticas migratorias neotropicales, que llegan a la laguna durante los meses de diciembre, algunas permanecen durante toda la temporada de migración en el sitio, o solo utilizan la laguna como hábitat de paso para su larga migración hacia el sur. Analizar la restauración de un área de 2.0 hectáreas con propágulos y plantas generadas en vivero de Rhizophora mangle L., en dos sitios con diferencias marcadas en las condiciones ambientales, a fin de recuperar gradualmente el hábitat.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Del 1 al 3 de junio de 2000 se realizó la colecta directa de propágulos o hipocótilos. Los propágulos se mantuvieron en agua durante 24 horas, con el fin evitar la desecación. Antes de la siembra se separó al azar una muestra de 5,427 hipocótilos (24.5% del total colectado), a los cuales se les registró su peso y longitud con el fin de conocer las características morfométricas del material que se llevó para sembrar, de acuerdo con los criterios de Tovilla (1998). La siembra se realizó manualmente desde el límite de la zona húmeda hasta una profundidad máxima de 20 cm, con una densidad de 1.2 propágulos/m2 aproximadamente de acuerdo con la metodología de Pulver (1976), Lewis (1982) y Sánchez et al. (2000).

En Laguna de Cabildo la siembra se realizó en cuatro etapas: el 5 de junio de 2000 se sembraron 9,227 hipocótilos, el 6 de julio 1,900, el 7 de agosto 2,737 hipocótilos y el 14 de agosto 5,481 hipocótilos; para un total de 19,345 hipocótilos en 1.5 hectáreas. Mientras que en Laguna de Pozuelos se sembraron 3,019 hipocótilos el 28 de septiembre, en un área de 0.5 ha. A partir de la aparición de las primeras hojas se midió mensualmente la altura y el desarrollo foliar de las plantas. 

En forma simultánea y para conocer diferencias en la velocidad de crecimiento, se germinaron 550 hipocótilos de R. mangle en vivero; para ello se colectó sedimento en Laguna de Pozuelos y se sembró en bolsas de plástico color negro de 15 cm x 25 cm. Estas plantas se llevaron a Pozuelos cuando tenían más de 90 días y una altura menor a 1.5 m, para evitar su deterioro y facilitar su traslado. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: En Laguna de Cabildo, la mortalidad inicial fue menor al 1% y la aparición de las primeras ramas se produjo aproximadamente a los 120 días, siendo éste un proceso generalizado en más del 60% de las plantas. Por el contrario, las raíces aéreas sólo aparecieron en menos del 8% de las plantas a los 210 días. La mortalidad fue variable desde 45.38%, en las plántulas de la tercera etapa, hasta una máximo de 67.46% en la cuarta etapa. 

Las plantas de la segunda y cuarta etapa fueron las que mostraron un desarrollo más robusto. A lo largo de los 1,200 m del bordo que separa la granja camaronera de la laguna, las plantas que alcanzaron la mayor altura fueron las que estaban en el límite de la zona de inundación, debido a que en este lugar existía humedad permanente entre el pastizal que existe sobre la parte media y alta del bordo. Al final en esta laguna se contabilizaron un total 7,816 plántulas.

En Laguna de Pozuelos la mortalidad fue nula. A los 120 días se contaron 7,584 plántulas, es decir, hubo un incremento del 151.2%, con una altura promedio de 32.6 cm; mientras que a los 240 días, al final del experimento, las plantas habían alcanzado una altura de 65.0 cm. El tiempo en que aparecieron las primeras ramas fue semejante al observado en la otra laguna; que las raíces aéreas aparecieron a los 150 días, en más del 18% de las plántulas.

En los 550 propágulos del vivero, 26 días después de sembrados, empezaron a emerger el primer par de hojas y a los 39 días el proceso se había completado. A los 60 días, todas las plantas presentaban el segundo par de hojas; mientras que la ramificación sucedió a los 90 días; hasta el día en que estas plantas se llevaron al campo no se habían formado raíces aéreas. En estas plantas, al llevarse al campo, la mortalidad fue menor a un 5%, alcanzando una altura de 71.7 cm después de 300 días.

Las mediciones realizadas sobre 5,427 propágulos, indican que estos presentaban una longitud promedio de 29.07 cm y un peso de 29.77 g. La muestra presentó gran variación en su morfometría y se registraron por igual propágulos de tamaño pequeño y muy pesados, que aquellos largos y ligeros. Estas variaciones se hicieron más evidentes entre mayo y julio, época en que se registró una gran cantidad de hipocótilos en los bosques, muchos estaban deformados por mordeduras de cangrejos y orugas de lepidópteros. También se observó la presencia poliploidía, es decir, hasta cuatro hipocótilos emergiendo de un mismo fruto, incluso la presencia de propágulos albinos (amarillos, rosas y rojos). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Factores ambientales como la temperatura, insolación y evaporación contribuyeron considerablemente a elevar la mortalidad de las plantas en las áreas reforestadas durante la época seca en Laguna de Cabildo. La insolación varía de acuerdo con los periodos de lluvia y estiaje, en los que la nubosidad cambia, es decir, durante el periodo de mayo a octubre la cantidad media de nubosidad es alta y la insolación es baja, mientras que en el periodo noviembre a abril, esta relación se invierte. El año 2001 fue un año seco en el área, con temperaturas promedio entre febrero y mayo de hasta 35 Â°C. Anualmente se registra un déficit entre la evaporación (1,653.3 mm) vs la precipitación (1,143 mm) (INEGI, 1997). Esto provocó que, a medida que avanzaba la temporada seca, todo el sitio fuera quedando sin agua, lo que incrementó la temperatura del suelo hasta 44 Â°C, además de que el suelo estaba muy duro y pobre en materia orgánica. Estas condiciones contribuyeron a acelerar la mortalidad. Entre marzo y mayo se observaron plantas cuyas hojas presentaban cloración y estaban incluso deshidratadas por el sol. De acuerdo con González et al. (1995), cuando la temperatura se incrementa, la tasa de transpiración incrementa la pérdida de agua, por lo tanto el volumen interno en las hojas, que regula las concentraciones de iones en la savia, disminuye.

Hasta un 40% de la pérdida de plantas en esta laguna se debió a daños por el paso constante de personas y animales (borregos y cerdos) al principio del bordo (1a etapa). Esta área se restauró hasta en dos ocasiones, con resultados semejantes, por lo que no se volvió a sembrar en la periferia de los sitios habitados.

Laguna de Pozuelos es un humedal que mantiene un volumen constante de agua todo el año, por lo que esto no representó una limitante para la sobrevivencia de las plantas; en la zona donde se llevó a cabo la reforestación, en la época de lluvias, el nivel del agua alcanza hasta 0.9 m. El aporte constante de propágulos por la marea duplicó el número sembrado al principio.
En este experimento, la selección adecuada de los sitios de colecta de los propágulos en “arboles semilleros”, la colecta directa en los árboles y un buen manejo del material aseguraron una baja mortalidad al inicio del experimento (menor a 1%), ya que el establecimiento de los propágulos es un periodo crítico dentro del ciclo de los manglares (Tomlinson, 1986). Los propágulos utilizados en esta restauración presentaban una simetría de 1:1 entre la longitud y el peso, con una medida de longitud y peso mayor que aquellos reportados en la literatura.
Este experimento arrojó resultados alentadores. En ambos sistemas lagunares la aparición de las hojas se registró de 20 a 28 días antes que en Florida (66 días) y bajo condiciones de salinidad más extremas (Smith y Snedaker, 1995). La altura alcanzada por las plantas en este experimento fue otro factor notable; experiencias obtenidas en Colombia (Sánchez et al., 2000), indican que, después de 245 días, las plantas presentaban una altura de 27.3 cm contra 61.5 cm en Laguna de Cabildo y hasta 65 cm en Pozuelos.
En este experimento como en otros, se ha comprobado que las plantas de R. mangle desarrolladas en viveros presentan una baja mortalidad (1%) y mayor altura (71.4 cm) que aquellas desarrolladas en el campo e incluso se ramifican más rápido. Esto se debe a condiciones adecuadas de humedad, sombreado y ausencia de competencia por sustrato y nutrientes, características de los viveros.
La siembra directa es una técnica de bajo costo (en Laguna de Pozuelos el costo por planta al finalizar el experimento fue de 0.11 dólares estadounidenses; mientras que en Cabildo fue de 0.17), lo que permite reforestar grandes áreas. Este costo puede verse modificado debido a la lejanía de los sitios de acopio y cantidad disponible de propágulos.
La producción de plantas en vivero incrementa notablemente los costos por planta (1.06 dólares estadounidenses por planta) así como los de cualquier proyecto en particular, debido a la colecta y transporte de sedimentos, llenado de bolsas, cuidados, manejo de los propágulos y las plantas hasta que estas se llevan al campo. Sólo se debe utilizar para cubrir los espacios donde la siembra directa no haya sido exitosa. Para tener dominio de la plantación se debe llevar a cabo un seguimiento así como una vigilancia constante sobre las áreas restauradas. "

El área fue quemada y posteriormente talada ilegalmente en su totalidad. Por su ubicación, es importante recuperar la cubierta vegetal de esta ladera para detener la erosión del suelo y proteger la cuenca. Cuatro años después del incendio la cobertura arbustiva era alta (54%), aunque el sitio aún mantenía 50% de suelo desnudo y había una baja regeneración natural de Austrocedrus chilensis (menos de un brinzal por hectárea). En el invierno de 2004 se plantaron 3,000 plantas desarrolladas en viveros. Los resultados preliminares indican que la supervivencia de los individuos plantados estuvo asociada a la presencia de arbustos (posibles nodrizas) y hierbas nativas que facilitaron el éxito de establecimiento inicial de A. chilensis.Deforestation, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Por su ubicación periurbana, el área ha sido quemada reiteradamente entre los años 1994 y 2000, y posteriormente ha sido talada ilegalmente en su totalidad. En el sitio no quedan árboles vivos o muertos en pie y hay gran cantidad de cárcavas en el suelo por el efecto del deslizamiento de rollizos pendiente abajo junto a la acción del agua. Las capas superiores del suelo en muchos sectores han desaparecido y en algunos lugares aflora la roca madre subyacente. Aunque el sitio presenta un alto nivel de degradación, en algunas partes se ha comenzado a recuperar la cobertura vegetal, principalmente con hierbas y arbustos. El área está actualmente cercada para evitar el acceso a la misma y la extracción de madera de los bosques colindantes de N. dombeyi, N. pumilio y A. chilensis. Austrocedrus chilensis (D. Don) Pic. Ser. et Bizarri (ciprés de la cordillera), Fitzroya cupressoides (alerce) y Pilgerodendron uviferum (ciprés de las Guaitecas) son coníferas dioicas pertenecientes a la familia Cupressaceae de los bosques templados australes de Chile y Argentina (Rovere et al. 2003). A. chilensis es la única especie forestal de los bosques templados cuya distribución natural es mayor en la vertiente oriental de los Andes (Gallo et al. 2004). En Chile se la encuentra aproximadamente entre los 36 y 39 grados de latitud sur y en Argentina entre los 39 y los 43 grados. Es una especie longeva, que puede superar los 500 años de edad; sin embargo, es raro encontrar ejemplares de esa edad en la región debido a la alta frecuencia de disturbios (Kitzberger 1994). La especie crece a lo largo de un marcado gradiente de precipitación del oeste hacia el este. Por ello en el oeste, se la encuentra formando bosques mixtos con el coihue (Nothofagus dombeyi); en la parte media del gradiente se encuentran bosques puros densos de ciprés y hacia el este, en la estepa patagónica, forma bosquetes menos densos (Veblen et al. 1995). Estudios genecológicos que analizan la variación geográfica de características métricas evidencian que éstas responden a un marcado control genético, encontrándose la mayor diversidad genética en las poblaciones marginales y xérofíticas de la estepa (Gallo et al. 2004). En la actualidad los bosques de A. chilensis cubren aproximadamente 159,000 hectáreas, El objetivo general de este trabajo fue identificar los factores ecológicos que influyen sobre la restauración del bosque nativo degradado de Austrocedrus chilensis en el noroeste de la Patagonia.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Durante el invierno de 2004, en el mes de agosto, se realizó la plantación experimental con plantas desarrolladas en viveros a partir de semillas de procedencia local. En total se transplantaron 3,000 renovales de cuatro años de edad (dos años en almácigo y dos después del repique). La plantación se realizó con pan de tierra (cepellón), ubicándose 2,000 plantas bajo diferentes arbustos nativos presentes en el área, y 1,000 plantas en sitios expuestos (sin protección de los arbustos), con un espaciamiento entre plantas de aproximadamente 3 metros. Se rotularon el 50% (N = 1,515) de todos los individuos plantados a fin de poderlos monitorear posteriormente. También se registró información sobre el entorno de cada planta: tipo de cobertura presente (presencia o ausencia de arbustos y tipo de arbusto), hierbas y cobertura del suelo. Se midió inicialmente la altura total y el diámetro basal del tallo de cada renoval con el objetivo de examinar cómo el tamaño inicial afecta la supervivencia de las plantas.

La supervivencia de los renovales se evaluó en dos períodos: (a) después de la primavera de 2004, a mediados del mes de diciembre y (b) después del verano-otoño de 2005, a fines del mes de mayo. El estado vital de la planta se evaluó como bueno, regular o malo (en el caso de las plantas muertas) en función de su aspecto de turgencia (turgente o no turgente) y color del follaje (verde, amarillento, marrón). En algunos casos, cuando se encontraron indicios específicos (ahogamiento por deslizamiento de suelo, herbivoría, etc.), se determinó la causa de la muerte.

La composición florística y la cobertura de las especies herbáceas y arbustivas del sitio se evaluó en 25 parcelas ubicadas al azar de 2 Á— 2 m para los arbustos y de 1 Á— 1 m para las hierbas y cobertura de suelo. Posteriormente se calculó la cobertura promedio para cada especie (Matteucci y Colma 1982). La abundancia de renovales de especies arbóreas que regeneraron naturalmente se estimó mediante inventarios en toda el área, A fin de evaluar las características de las especies que recolonizaron el lugar, se determinó su origen (nativa o exótica) y la forma de vida (hierba, arbusto, enredadera o árbol). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Se registró una supervivencia promedio de 96% al finalizar la primavera de 2004 y de 84% al finalizar el verano y otoño de 2005. Al evaluar la supervivencia de la primavera, tanto bajo la protección de los arbustos como fuera de los arbustos, se verificó la proliferación de tres especies de enredaderas (Vicia nigricans y Lathyrus magellanicus (ambas Fabaceae) y Mutisia decurrens (Asteraceae), las cuales crecían tanto sobre los arbustos utilizados como nodrizas, como sobre los renovales plantados originalmente sin protección. Esto obligó a considerar la supervivencia también bajo esta nueva condición, es decir, renovales plantados inicialmente sin protección de arbustos pero cubiertos por enredaderas. Así, se comparó la supervivencia en estas tres condiciones de cobertura diferentes: (a) bajo los arbustos con o sin presencia de enredaderas, (b) fuera de los arbustos, sin ningún tipo de protección y (c) fuera de los arbustos, con cubierta de enredaderas.

Al comparar la supervivencia después de la primavera bajo las tres condiciones mencionadas se encontraron diferencias significativas. No se encontraron diferencias significativas en la supervivencia de los renovales plantados bajo arbustos, tuvieran o no enredadera, y los plantados en condiciones abiertas pero cubiertos por enredaderas. Sin embargo, la supervivencia de los renovales plantados en condiciones abiertas pero cubiertos por enredaderas fue mayor que la de aquellos plantados en condiciones abiertas y sin ningún tipo de protección. La supervivencia después del primer verano-otoño también fue diferente entre las distintas condiciones de cobertura. Se encontraron diferencias en la supervivencia de los renovales plantados bajo arbustos, con o sin cobertura de enredaderas, y los plantados en condiciones abiertas, cubiertos o no por enredaderas.

Las plantas utilizadas en el ensayo presentaban inicialmente una altura promedio de 23.9 (Â± 0.17) cm y un diámetro basal de 3.24 (Â± 0.02) mm. Considerando la influencia del tamaño inicial sobre la supervivencia, se encontraron después de la primavera (la primera estación posterior al transplante) diferencias en el estado de vitalidad de las plantas tanto en altura como en el diámetro basal. Las plantas en estado bueno o regular presentaron valores similares de altura, mientras que las plantas muertas presentaban alturas iniciales menores que las anteriores. Con respecto al diámetro basal, las plantas que estaban en mejor estado tuvieron tallos de mayor diámetro que las plantas en estado regular o que las muertas. Al analizar la influencia del tamaño inicial sobre la supervivencia luego del primer verano-otoño posterior al transplante, no se encontraron diferencias con respecto a la altura, pero sí con respecto al diámetro basal. Las plantas en mejor estado presentaron mayores valores iniciales de diámetro basal que las que se encontraban en estado regular o que estaban muertas.

La cobertura de arbustos promedió 54%, siendo las especies más abundantes Schinus patagonica (Anacardiaceae) y Fabiana imbricata (Solanaceae). Del total de arbustos registrados, sólo la rosa mosqueta (Rosa rubiginosa, Rosaceae) es de origen exótico. La cobertura de especies herbáceas promedió 68%: la especie más abundante (44%) fue la enredadera Vicia nigricans (Fabaceae), seguida de las gramíneas (21%). Un 54% de las hierbas registradas son exóticas. El porcentaje de suelo desnudo resultó bastante alto en el sitio (un promedio de 50%). Entre las especies leñosas que formaban el bosque original se registraron densidades menores de un brinzal de A. chilensis por hectárea y de 1.6 brinzales de N. pumilio por hectárea. También se observaron algunos individuos jóvenes aislados de abedul (Betula pendula, Betulaceae), un árbol de origen exótico. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: En el presente estudio, la mortalidad registrada después del período verano-otoño (12%) fue un poco más alta que la observada después de la primavera (4%). Esto probablemente se debió a las condiciones climáticas de la región, donde el verano se extiende en los meses de mayor déficit hídrico (De Fina 1972). La mortalidad obtenida durante la primavera, fue menor a la esperada si se considera que varios autores han documentado menores valores de supervivencia en la primera estación que sigue a la plantación, debido al estrés asociado con el transplante (Pakkad et al. 2003; Castro et al. 2004; Renison et al. 2005). En este estudio, la proliferación de enredaderas sobre los renovales de A. chilensis facilitó su reintroducción al brindar protección contra la desecación y así, reducir la mortalidad esperada después del transplante. Sin embargo, la mortalidad de los renovales fue mayor en el verano-otoño, no sólo por las condiciones climáticas menos propicias, sino también por la senescencia y muerte de las enredaderas a mediados del verano.

Además de las muertes de plantas por desecación producidas en el verano, también se registró la mortalidad de renovales de A. chilensis por herbivoría. Aunque el área está cercada para evitar la herbivoría de los grandes mamíferos, en la zona hay presencia de abundantes liebres, las cuales causaron la muerte de un pequeño número de plantas durante el período de verano-otoño. Considero que la mortalidad ocasionada por la herbivoría de liebres puede ser mayor durante el invierno siguiente, ya que en este período disminuye la disponibilidad de alimento de otras plantas. En un trabajo de análisis de la dieta de herbívoros en la misma región, se encontró que A. chilensis constituye un elemento común de la dieta y que su consumo aumenta sustancialmente durante el otoño e invierno (Relva y Caldiz 1998).

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Adicionalmente a la recuperación del área boscosa por medio de la restauración ecológica se recuperan también otras funciones importantes que sólo pueden conseguirse si se mantiene el bosque en buenas condiciones de conservación, entre las que destacan la retención de suelo y la protección de cuencas cercanas (Lamb y Gilmour 2003), el valor escénico del paisaje (Martin 1986) y el uso de recursos no maderables que realizan las comunidades suburbanas (Ladio y Rapoport 1999).
La presencia de arbustos facilitó la supervivencia de los renovales de A. chilensis plantados durante el verano, posiblemente por la protección contra la desecación. En la región de estudio el verano es la época de mayor incidencia de la falta de humedad. La presencia de arbustos también fue beneficiosa para la supervivencia durante el otoño e invierno, épocas del año con mayores precipitaciones. En lugares con pendiente pronunciada, los arbustos ayudaron a conservar el suelo y evitaron deslizamientos de tierra. Por todo lo mencionado, el enriquecimiento de matorrales secundarios con las especies arbóreas dominantes que se quieran introducir parece ser un procedimiento adecuado para prácticas de restauración. Las redes de cooperación extendidas entre diferentes instituciones durante la planificación y desarrollo de este proyecto de restauración del bosque nativo han permitido trabajar tanto en los aspectos operativos del mismo, como en la concienciación de la comunidad local sobre el cuidado y protección del ambiente.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/mexico-black-mangrove-restoration-at-laguna-de-balandra-baja-california-sur/	Mexico: Black Mangrove Restoration at Laguna de Balandra, Baja California Sur	Mexico	1994-08-05	1996-12-05	"Black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) seedlings (n=555) were grown from field-collected propagules for several months in a new type of terrestrial nursery. They were grouped in clusters of five plants and then transplanted to a clear-cut zone at Laguna de Balandra, a lagoon fringed by mangrove forest in Baja California Sur, Mexico. The survival rates and development of the transplanted seedlings were monitored at 6-month intervals for 2 years. After 1 month, the survival of seedlings was 96%, and after 24 months, 74% of the plants were still alive. Due to the slow rate of natural regeneration observed at the lagoon, and the proven susceptibility of directly-sown propagules to high salinity levels in these arid-zone mangroves, the success of this initial transplantation bodes well for the eventual restoration of arid coastal lagoons and estuaries using nursery-reared seedlings.Deforestation, Mining & Resource Extraction All the white and black mangrove trees at the project site had been poached for firewood in 1991, leaving a barren, flat, muddy tidal area of about 1500m2. The clearcut area was naturally regenerated from 1991 to 1996 at a very slow rate and was partially covered at its edges by annual salicornia plants (Salicornia bigelouii Torr.). The aims of this study were: (i) to develop a simple and inexpensive nursery method for producing seedlings for the reforestation of mangrove swamps in an arid zone, (ii) to monitor the development of such plants under natural conditions, and (iii) to compare the efficiency of artificial reforestation to natural regeneration in an arid-zone mangrove ecosystem.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Black mangrove propagules (Avicennia germinans (L.) Stern) were collected from the same location at Laguna de Balandra described in a previous study (Toledo et al., 1995). Propagules (4 cm long) were picked directly from the trees in August 1994, transferred to the laboratory and examined. Those with small insect holes were discarded. Propagules were washed and disinfected as previously described (Toledo et al., 1995). Because our previous nursery techniques failed, only one nursery method was evaluated in this study.

White sand was collected from a beach in Laguna de Balandra, sieved (1 mm mesh), and washed 10 - 12 times with pressurized salty tap water (2560 Î¼mhos cmâˆ’1) until the discarded supernatant was completely clear. Sand (approx. 800 g) was then loosely packed into cylindrical, 900-ml plastic biodegradable bags. Each bag was supplemented once with the mineral salt solution of Murashige & Skoog (1962) medium. The bags did not have a drainage hole. The volume of the solution in the bags was adjusted to maintain approximately 3 mm of water over the sand surface at all times. To prevent potentially damaging salt accumulation (which at high concentration might inhibit seedling growth or cause death (Cintrón et al., 1980)) in the nursery bags due to high evaporation rates, seedlings were watered daily with desalinized water (325 Î¼mhos cmâˆ’1; equi. 0.2 g salts lâˆ’1) to the required water level above the sand surface. The total accumulation of salt during the entire growth period did not exceed salt concentration in seawater (33 g lâˆ’1 salts). As this is a critical step of the nursery procedure, the salt level was routinely verified by conductivity measurements.

Five propagules were planted in each bag, 1 - 2 cm apart, on the sand surface, and incubated indoors at a light intensity of 200 Î¼mole mâˆ’2 sâˆ’1 for 1 week at 25+3 ÂºC. Once the propagules developed a few roots, they were transferred outdoors and incubation continued in a shaded (<3 h direct sunlight per day), outdoor nursery for 90 d. The average ambient day:night temperatures were 37, 34 and 30 ÂºC and 24, 20 and 19 ÂºC in September, October and November 1994. The relative humidity was 25 - 40% with no rain and no strong winds during this period. Light intensity ranged from 116 in the shade to 1622 Î¼mole mâˆ’2 sâˆ’1 in full sun. Because information available before this study indicated high seedling mortality after transplantation in the arid zone lagoon, researchers decided to introduce the nursery seedlings in clusters, to achieve a meaningful plant population. Only bags containing 5 developed seedlings each (approx. 10 cm high with 4 - 6 leaves each) were transferred to the mangrove swamp.

Nursery-reared black mangrove seedlings (555 plants in 111 bagged clusters) were transferred to Laguna de Balandra in December 1994. They were planted during one morning at low tide in their plastic bags (to avoid damage to the root system and to reduce the shock due to an abrupt change in their growth environment) in holes dug with a hole digger. Five to six long cuts were made in each bag from the top to the bottom. The cuts did not directly expose the roots to the environment. The roots emerged from the bags only after an additional growing period and biodegradation of the bags. The distance from one cluster to another was 1Â±0.20 m as recommended for Avicennia transplantation in other ecosystems (Teas, 1977). The few natural mangrove seedlings in the study area were left in place, reducing the distances between clusters. In no case was a cluster planted <60 cm from a volunteer plant. To distinguish transplanting from natural regeneration, all transplants were arranged in a grid plot with marked borders. Also, no seedlings were planted close to the existing forest, since this increases seedling mortality (Aksornkoae, 1981 cited in Aksornkoae et al., 1984). Although the reforestation zone was near a popular beach, it was protected from vandalism by a soft, deep natural mud barrier which denied access, and by warning signs. After planting, the reforestation area was not further treated. Plant survival was monitored initially 1, 2 and 4 weeks after planting and every 6 months thereafter. Data on plant height, number of leaves and survival rates were collected. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The propagule vigor of black mangroves collected from the wild was high; the survival of propagules in the nursery for the initial 3 months was 100%. A small number of propagules (<5%) developed relatively small seedlings (1 - 2 leaves, <10 cm height) and were discarded. The seedlings growing in the nursery showed no disease symptoms. Biocides were, therefore, not used.

Plant population histograms drawn from measurements taken during 2 years in the reforestation area revealed that plant heights followed a normal distribution pattern in most sampling periods. Average seedling heights were 13, 31, 46 and 62 cm, after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The tallest plants were 24 cm (after 6 months), 63 cm (after 12 months), 90 cm (after 18 months), and 120 cm (after 24 months).

The number of leaves per plant did not follow a normal distribution. The average number of leaves per plant was 10, 32, 48 and 178 after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, with the largest number of leaves of 22 (after 6 months), 56 (after 12 months), 118 (after 18 months) and 432 (after 24 months). There was a significant linear correlation between plant height and the number of leaves.

Weekly visits after transplantation of the seedlings to the swamp revealed that after 4 weeks 96% of all plants survived. Later, the survival rate declined and was 86% (6 months), 77% (1.0 and 1.5 years). After 2 years, 74% of all original seedlings were alive, and all were still growing after 4 years.

All nursery clusters used for reforestation were originally planted in the swamp with 5 seedlings per cluster. With time, the number of the plants in each cluster declined, forming clusters with 1 - 5 plants. The number of clusters with different plant densities varied from 140 clusters with 5 plants to only 6 clusters with one plant.

Because naturally established seedlings were not removed from the study zone, the annual rate of natural regeneration could be monitored. Except for 1995, when 25 white mangrove plants were established, the natural regeneration was slow and consisted of 8 plants per year per 350 m2 of swamp. The slowest natural regeneration was exhibited by red mangroves, with only a single plant established in 6 years. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: In many tropical areas, mangroves are able to regenerate, given sufficient recovery time (Aksornkoae et al., 1984). However, in dry zones with little tidal flux, mangroves regenerate poorly after clear-cutting. For example, in Bahia de La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico, hardly any survive in spite of the fact that many seedlings germinate naturally by the end of the propagule season (Bashan, 1999 unpublished). Six years after the clear-cut in Laguna de Balandra, only 48 new seedlings were found per 350 m2. The cause for this low rate of natural reforestation and the limited development of mangroves in arid zones was attributed by Cintrón et al. (1980) to a high rate of evaporation without compensation by fresh water and thus, a high level of soil salinity. Although mangroves are basically tolerant of high salt levels and low oxygen levels, very high salinity results in sparse vegetation, small, slender trees, and eventually a high mortality rate for both seedlings and trees (Cintrón et al., 1978, 1980; Jintana et al., 1992).

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Because they are an important refuge and feeding ground for numerous economically important fish and shellfish species, mangrove forests are indispensable for sustainable coastal fisheries. Therefore, this and other mangrove reforestation projects will benefit local livelihoods by ensuring the continued vitality of a valuable ecosystem.
Direct sowing of mangrove propagules (as practiced in Southeast Asia) in these dry-climate ecosystems is usually unsuccessful. Although seedlings may initially be established successfully, most eventually die within a few months. Research experience has thus far shown that propagules grown under controlled conditions in growth chambers cannot withstand the stress of transfer to the harsh environmental conditions of Baja California Sur (Toledo, 1994, unpublished). Furthermore, previous attempts to create a nursery in pots submerged in the tidal zone, or to use tissue-culture seedlings, have also been disappointing (Holguin et al., 1991, unpublished). Therefore, development of an outdoor nursery system that would function independent of tides was needed to overcome the salt-stress susceptibility of seedlings when transplanted. The wood of red mangroves is preferred commercially, and most of the Pacific coast of Central America is colonized by this species (Jiménez, 1988), but black mangroves were chosen as a model for this study due to the availability of propagules and their compact size–making them easier to transplant as seedlings (Carlton, 1974; Teas, 1977).
Because the survival rate of seedlings in the terrestrial nursery was very high, the development of trees after transplantation to their natural environment was monitored for 2 years without special tending, and survival rates were monitored for 4 years. The data on seedling survival in the wild are varied. High survival rates in Southeast Asia have been reported, while survival rates elsewhere are often lower (Rabinowitz, 1978; Aksornkoae et al., 1984; Patterson et al., 1993). Information on the survival of mangrove seedlings in arid zones is scarce (Cintrón et al., 1978), but rates of regeneration are generally low. The nursery system developed for this project, besides confirming the possibility of producing nursery-reared black mangrove seedlings, also demonstrated that these seedlings will survive well after transplantation in arid-zone mangroves, improving the feasibility of reforesting mangroves in areas where natural regeneration is slow.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-alabama-cumberland-sandstone-glade-restoration-at-the-william-b-bankhead-national-forest/	USA: Alabama: Cumberland Sandstone Glade Restoration at the William B. Bankhead National Forest	United States of America	2007-01-21	2007-03-21	"Sandstone glades of the Southern Cumberland Plateau are rare and unique plant communities exhibiting some of the richest endemic floras of any habitat type in the eastern United States. As such, they have become a conversation priority and are included in a broad restoration initiative of the US Forest Service at William B. Bankhead National Forest in northern Alabama. In 2007, a pilot project was conducted on a 3-acre glade to test methodology and thus help guide and inform broader restoration goals. Excessive woody biomass was removed from the site to accommodate the open-condition requirements of its endemic and common plant species, and plans were made to reintroduce landscape-level fire influences to the site on a periodic basis. Outcomes from this project will shape the implementation of restoration activities at the 50 other small glades expected to be targeted under the initiative.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Generally, the current conditional assessment of the glades is poor to fair. The number of woody stems and biomass accumulations within the glade interiors, rock outcrops and the surrounding ecotones is excessive, frequently falling outside desirable levels.
Ecologically, this results from temporally and spatially altered fire regimes which allowed the proliferation of woody vegetation, especially within ecotonal areas. These natural communities need periodic fire to maintain the open-condition requirements of its endemic and common plant species. As a result of active fire exclusion in the surrounding silvicultural uplands, the glades have been excluded from natural disturbance and commonly exhibit encroachment by loblolly and virginia pines, shrubs, vines and woody forbs. Moss and lichens may in some cases be considered overabundant.
Downed woody debris frequently covers the sites. In combination with this pine recruitment and woody encroachment, the Bankhead National Forest has been subjected to tree mortality caused by southern pine beetle infestations, wind events and droughts that have displaced abnormally large amounts of downed trees within and around the glades. Coincided biomass intrusions into the glade interior results in increased soil accumulation that elicit shifts in plant species and composition and allow native and non-native invasive species expansion. In addition, conditions of the glades also suffer from direct human caused habitat modifications from unauthorized vehicle travel, trash deposition and other impacts. Glade communities are typically embedded within adjacent forested community types and, without exception, are associated with rock outcrops, edaphically-controlled herbaceous plant and non-vascular taxa communities occurring on exposed bedrock or of very shallow soil accumulation. As such, they illustrate the impact of bedrock geology on plants and often exemplify the development of plant endemism. In fact, sandstone and limestone glades represent some of the richest endemic floras for any habitat type in the eastern United States, with 26 endemic or near-endemic taxa (Baskin and Baskin 1986), four of which are federally listed as Endangered or Threatened (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2006). Each of these discrete communities is found on the Bankhead National Forest.
The species composition and habitat conditions of the sandstone glade observed at the Bankhead National Forest are somewhat similar to that characterized under the natural vegetation classifications developed for the Alabama Cumberland Sandstone Glade (A. Schotz, 1998) and Cumberland Sandstone Flat Rock Glade (M. Pyne, 2005), but exhibit regional and species variations.
Where soils are non-existent or sufficiently shallow to limit the establishment of woody species, a suite of low-growing herbs, bryophytes, and lichens commonly become well developed. Characteristic groundcover vegetation associated with glades of the Bankhead National Forest includes Cladina spp., Cladonia spp., Polytrichum spp., Grimmia spp., Liatris microcephala, Packera anonyma, Hypericum gentianoides, Nuttallanthus canadensis, Eurybia hemispherica, Opuntia humifusa, Croton willdenowii, Polygala curtissii, Agalinis tenuifolia, Danthonia sericea, Andropogon virginicus and Schizachyrium scoparium. Small, contorted examples of Pinus virginiana occupy areas with an accumulation of soils, such as rock crevices and micro-depressions, as well as dominating some ecotones.
While Pinus virginiana often attains the greatest prominence within ecotones and further up slopes, a suite of secondary associates also occur as arborescent species, most notably Amelanchier arborea, Kalmia latifolia, Hypericum frondosum, Chionanthus virginicus, Oxydendrum arboreum, Vaccinium arboreum, and the vines, Gelsemium sempervirens, Bignonia capreolata and Vitis rotundifolia.
As the soil covering becomes heavier, denser woods appear, the succession of principal trees being about as follows (where not manipulated by silviculture): Quercus alba, Quercus falcata, Carya alba, Pinus echinata, Liriodendron tulipifera, Quercus stellata, and Oxydendrum arboreum, the last-named being equally at home in both associations. The conservation goal is to prioritize rehabilitation of multiple large & small glade patches and attempt to connect these, where possible, and integrate all restored glades into the surrounding woodland or forest ecosystem management processes (encouraging the frequent use of prescribed fire as a management tool). This conservation goal would, in theory, mean restoring approximately 50 small glade examples or 0.001% of the total National Forest landscape.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: A sandstone glade near the Cranal Road was identified and funding secured to initiate a pilot project during the Winter and early Spring 2007. A restoration plan was developed, and objectives included: 

--Manual removal of excessive accumulation of woody biomass interior to glade and associated rock outcrops with the deposition of this debris relocated beyond a distance of 66 feet (20 meters) from glade ecotones and thoroughly scattered to minimize modifications in subsequent fire behavior 

--Eradicate any non-native invasive species intrusion and eliminate reproducibility of all surrounding non-native populations 

--Reintroduce fire influences at the landscape level, where practicable 

--Strategically integrate discreet communities into broader management 

--Monitor vegetation responses and site-specific conditions 

As a general metric, increasing the average size of glade openings to 5 acres (2.02 hectares) over time, as monitored by aerial photography, GIS and permanent photo points, will be considered. The restored range of variation emphasizes parameters of a 0  -  14 basal area (sq. ft. / ac.) for the adjacent woodland; shrubs (including sprouts) should occupy less than 15% total glade cover; and at least 10 native herbaceous species per meter-squared plot will be indicated and monitored by periodic floristic survey and permanent photo points.

Surface fire regimes are planned to incorporate return frequency intervals of 2-3 years during the restoration phase and 3-5 during the maintenance phase. These fires should be moderate in severity and intensity. Fire seasonality targets should occur in late spring or early summer during the restoration phase and later, facilitate ample variation in long-term, post-restoration maintenance to be integrated within prescribe fire applications planned for the surrounding landscape. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The initial treatment has produced improvements in the open structural conditions upon which to further evaluate effects of the material impacts of the restoration. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Of note, the region has suffered from late-season freezing temperatures and from an extended drought, both to be considered within the response assessments during early glade monitoring.
As the sandstone glade community recovers an ecological integrity and functional conditions resulting from the restoration treatments, this pilot process will provide USFS resource managers important local guidance in addressing additional restoration of similar communities in the National Forest in order to achieve the target goals and broad conservation strategies for sandstone glade restoration. The Bankhead National Forest, in recognizing these unique habitats as important conservation elements, communicates an important public and ecological value to future generations. It exemplifies the development of adaptive approaches to the ecological restoration of discrete plant communities and their importance to regional biodiversity and long-term conservation stewardship. Debris removal will be continued in the coming months and monitoring of site conditions has begun. Photographic documentations and qualitative monitoring, having already been initiated, will continue annually.
Where possible, the Bankhead National Forest will include glades in prescribed burns planned for their surrounding forest resource compartment. In some instances, because of their location, some glades will be burned on three-year burn rotations, while others will be within ten-year burn plans. In some cases, inclusion of glades in a prescribed burn may not be practicable. "

Prior to the fire, mosses and tall graminoids predominated on the dune and dramatically altered the structure of what had once been a lichen-rich floristic community interspersed with patches of bare sand. Extensive data collected at the site in 1966 and again in 1990 allowed researchers to follow long-terms trends in species composition and to accurately assess the regenerative process following the fire. Due largely to the persistence of environmental factors present before the burn, the revegetated dune exhibited a similar structure and composition to that which had existed previously–that is, graminoids and mosses predominated at the expense of lichens. Researchers hope this study will be applicable to grass-dominated dune systems throughout NW Europe, where fire is now considered a tool for management and restoration.Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The cover of mosses and tall graminoids has, since the 1970s, increased considerably on coastal and inland sand dune grasslands throughout The Netherlands (Veer & Kooijman 1997) and NW Germany (Biermann 1996, 1999). Terrestrial lichen diversity has previously been very high in these dunes, especially in those with calcium poor sand of Pleistocene origin. In the past, grazing by cattle and rabbits kept the coastal dune grasslands in a condition of short grasses with patches of bare sand, where succession was frequently restarted (van Dieren 1934). In these “˜grey dunes,’ the Corynephorus canescens vegetation on decalcified sand was rich in lichens (Westhoff 1947; Erichsen 1957; Oostra 1968). Since the 1970s the lichen-rich plant community Violo-Corynephoretum (VC), occurring on coastal dunes, (Weeda et al. 1996; Biermann 1999) was affected by a lush growth of tall graminoids such as Ammophila arenaria, Calamagrostis epigejos and Carex arenaria. Other grasses began to dominate the lichen-rich Spergulo-Corynephoretum on calcium-poor inland dunes, and both communities were invaded by the exotic moss species Campylopus introflexus (van der Meulen et al. 1987).
Increased grass dominance has been connected to increased deposition of atmospheric nitrogen (N), which, in the 1990s, amounted to 20 kg N.ha – 1.a – 1 on the West Frisian Islands, The Netherlands (Bleeker & Erisman 1996). Ammonia initially acts as a nutrient enrichment, but in the soil it also turns into nitric acid, which causes the acidification of the dune soils. The calcium poor dunes had a relatively high P availability but were N-limited, resulting in a large effect of this increased N input (Kooijman et al. 1998) and accelerated succession (Veer & Kooijman 1997). The vigorous growth of Ammophila arenaria was also due to acidification, which altered the plant-parasitic microbial community in the dune grasslands on Terschelling (de Boer et al. 1998). The decrease in the rabbit population due to viral diseases further accelerated the dominance of these graminoids (ten Harkel & van der Meulen 1996).
In 1990, the southern slope was dominated by tall graminoids with hardly any bare sand left. The cover of graminoids and herbs (living plus dead) was more than 85% and much litter had accumulated. The abundance of graminoids in relation to herbs varied considerably over the slope: from 100% graminoids at the top to 15% at the foot; with 2% herbs at the top and 5% at the foot; very few lichens remained. In 1966 the vegetation composition on the southern slope was characterized by a combination of much bare sand (60%), vascular plants (28%), mosses (5%) and lichens (8%). Lichens from the pioneer stage of the VC, such as Cladonia foliacea, C. furcata and Cetraria aculeata, had moderate cover, while the humicole species of the later successional stages, such as Cladonia glauca and C. chlorophaea, were not as well developed on the southern slope as they were on the western slope.
In 1966, the western slope was covered by a well developed VC, very rich in lichens with high cover and much bare sand. Lichen species from the pioneer stage of the VC, such as Cladonia foliacea, C. furcata and Cetraria aculeata, had high cover and were growing in locations exposed to full sunlight. The humicole species of the later successional stages, such as C. glauca and C. chlorophaea, were growing abundantly on and between mosses (Hypnum cupressiforme and Dicranum scoparium), a substrate with a pH-H2O of 4.8 (Oostra 1968). They were growing in well lit places, but also in partial shade. At that time, only a few aero-hygrophytic species, such as the reindeer lichen Cladina portentosa, were present. The generally epiphytic lichens Hypogymnia physodes, Platismatia glauca and Pseudevernia furfuracea were growing on sand- and moss-covered dune soil (Ketner- Oostra & SÁ½kora 2004), a substrate with a pH-H2O of 5.0 (Oostra 1968). The aim of the study was to assess the regeneration of burned dune grassland vegetation with possible restoration of the former open, dry-dune grassland rich in lichens (Oostra 1968). The hypothesis tested was that burning can be used to restore terricolous lichen diversity in former “˜grey dunes’ (VC) dominated by tall graminoids.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Fire has been frequently used to manage heathlands (Gimingham 1994) and is now considered a management tool in grass-dominated dune grasslands. Knowledge of the effect of fire on soil lichens and their re-establishment could provide basic information for future management measures to regain former biodiversity in coastal and inland dune grasslands.

An opportunity for research presented itself in 1993 after a wildfire removed most of the vegetation on a dune body in the coastal dunes of Terschelling. This large dune had a monitoring history going back to 1966, when the lichen-rich vegetation was described both quantitatively, with large blocks in transects, and qualitatively with relevés (Oostra 1968). In 1990, just a few years before the fire, the dune was studied again to document the decline in species richness as result of increased dominance of Ammophila arenaria, Calamagrostis epigejos and Carex arenaria. After a very dry period in early spring 1993, the lichen-poor dune, dominated by tall graminoids and with much standing dead plant material and litter, was intensively burned by a wildfire. The field layer turned into ash, and the dwarfshrubs (Empetrum nigrum) on the upper part of the western slope burned deeply into their root system. The bottom layer turned partly into ash, and the high temperatures killed all cryptogams. Only a few blocks with patches of reindeer lichens at the bottom of the western slope were not burned.

A total of 24 blocks (4 m x ï€ 4 m) were studied in a transect (three blocks wide by eight blocks long) on the southern slope of the RD dune, and 52 blocks in another transect (two blocks wide by 26 long) on the western slope. Cover of five major moss species and dwarf-shrubs (Empetrum nigrum) was estimated, along with the total cover of living and dead vascular plants (graminoids and herbs), litter, mosses, lichens, bare sand and ash, in 1966, 1990 and (after the fire in 1993) annually until 2001, except in 2000. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Immediately following the spring fire in 1993, both graminoids and rosette plants re-occurred. The cover of ash and bare sand was high. After two years, the cover of ash had decreased rapidly; after only two to four years, the cover of herbs, graminoids and litter had increased; and after three to eight years, the plant cover (including standing dead material) remained at a constant high level with much litter. The abundance of graminoids in relation to herbs still varied considerably over the slope during those years, especially the four years following the fire (1993-1997). This situation stabilized in the period 1998-2001: from 85% graminoids at the top to 20% at the foot; with 20% herbs both at the top and at the foot. The total moss cover increased from zero in the first year after the fire, to 40% in the second year and reached 65% after six years. 

Two lichen species were present three years after the fire (1996) and six species after five years. However, only a minor increase in number of lichen species and cover was found during the following years.

Immediately after the fire on the western slope, a high proportion of the studied blocks were covered by ash with some bare sand. Empetrum nigrum on the upper part of the slope did not reappear after the fire. In all burned blocks, the cover of higher plants (including standing dead material) and mosses quickly increased after the fire, resulting in dominance by 2001, a build up of litter, and very low abundance of lichens. Only on the unburned lower slope (lichen-rich in 1990) did mosses and higher plants remain at about the same level, while lichen cover remained high. The moss increase was partly different compared to the south slope. 

The lichens were slow to colonize after the fire. Five species occurred after three years, with Cladonia foliacea and C. furcata as the main pioneers, while eight species occurred after five years. The humicole species C. chlorophaea was found on burned stumps of Ammophila arenaria. Colonization by some species typical of subneutral sand, such as C. rangiformis and C. humilis, led to 11 species in 1999 (probably the result of sand blowing in), while some increase in cover was apparent in 2001. However, the total lichen cover of the studied blocks was still low in 2001.

The main difference on the southern slope between surveys conducted in 1990 (before the fire) and those from 2001 was the much higher moss cover found in 2001. Researchers observed the successive dominance of the three moss species Ceratodon purpureus, Campylopus introflexus and Polytrichum juniperinum. C. purpureus, a species strongly favoured by fire, reached a peak three years after the fire (southern slope 40%; western slope 55%). This moss is among the early colonizers in post-fire succession in heathland in Brittany (Gloaguen 1990) due to its wide diaspore dispersion (Clément & Touffet 1990). C. introflexus, a species characteristic of acidic, mineral-poor sand, gradually took over as succession proceeded. This species has been shown to have a high asexual reproductive rate that facilitates early successional dominance. Later in the succession, the habitat on the southern slope appeared to be particularly suitable for the xerophytic moss P. juniperinum. It increased from < 1% in 1995 to 45% in 1999, with a simultaneous decrease in cover of C. introflexus to 20%. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Annual surveys showed a slow and very limited re-establishment by lichens after the wildfire, especially on the southern slope. No living fragments were initially found, indicating that the wildfire must have been very intense. Some lichen species had settled on the western slope (11 species in total), but their total cover was very low (< 2 % after eight years, 2001). This can be compared with a mean cover of 42% in the original ""˜grey dunes' of 1966. Lichens here are dependent on open vegetation with much bare sand. In the research area, lichen colonization was probably limited by the fast colonizer C. purpureus, soon followed by C. introflexus. Another important factor was the quick regrowth of vascular plants (graminoids and rosette plants), which has previously been shown to be caused by high N deposition in calcium-poor dune ecosystems (Kooijman et al. 1998).

Thus, a similar vegetation as that found before the fire became established, partly from surviving perennial plant remains and partly from nearby areas of unburned vegetation, in accordance with the findings of Vestergaard & Alstrup (2001). The development of vegetation during later years was most probably a result of the same environmental factors that promoted dominance of graminoids before the fire, namely: (1) nitrogen deposition in combination with the available phosphates in the soil (Kooijman et al. 1998); (2) the impact of acidification on the soil micro-organisms which has been shown to influence the regrowth of Ammophila arenaria (de Boer et al. 1998) and (3) litter decomposition and soil formation during succession (Veer & Kooijman 1997; Kooijman & Besse 2002).
The results of this study show clearly that fire alone is not sufficient for management aimed at restoration of lichen-rich dune grasslands in calcium-poor coastal dunes, influenced by a relatively high N deposition. At the end of the study period (2001), the vegetation composition in the burned blocks was still quite different from the original composition in 1966. Even the Cladina mats, present at the foot of the western slope in 1990, did not recover after the fire. Additional measures are recommended, such as large-scale clearing of the burned vegetation to the mineral soil layer and promoting sand to be blown in. The sand will physically harm and dry out the remaining mosses, and C. introflexus especially has been shown to be sensitive to such treatment (Ketner- Oostra & SÁ½kora 2000; Ketner-Oostra 2002). Neutral or sub-neutral sand might be blown in from foredunes, from reactivated blowouts, or artificially brought to the site. This is especially important for the colonization and maintenance of lichen vegetation in the first stages of the VC in these calcium-poor Terschelling dunes, based on earlier research (Ketner-Oostra & SÁ½kora 2000; Ketner-Oostra 2001).

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/france-dune-restoration-in-north-brittany/	France: Dune Restoration in North Brittany	France	1988-09-03	2008-09-03	"Beginning in 1988, the local council of Ille et Vilaine, France began restoring coastal dunes in north Brittany that had suffered severe degradation as a result of sand quarrying and heavy tourism following World War II. Sites chosen for restoration were first fenced to prevent further trampling and were then planted with marram grass (Ammophila arenaria) in hopes that original dune morphology and floristic communities would gradually be achieved. A monitoring study conducted 10 years after the project’s commencement showed that the restoration was satisfactory in terms of geomorphology–creating a dune front similar to reference pioneer dunes and a dune summit in the advanced stage of a mobile dune–and that marram grass proved an effective tool for restoring topography. However, the monitoring study also showed that abiotic factors such as salinity and sand accretion played a significant role in determining species richness and composition, and the dunes’ conservation value is yet to be fully restored.Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Western France, and particularly Brittany, is a region that has attracted very large numbers of tourists since the Second World War (Guilcher & HallégouÁ«t 1991). The dunes have been greatly disturbed by factors such as sand quarrying and erosion caused by trampling and automobile traffic. In fact, walking, camping, driving, and especially motorcycling have ravaged the dune vegetation and caused remobilization of the sand. Because the original state of the Ille et Vilaine dunes is not precisely known due to the gradual nature of the degradation, the project’s aims were described in terms of European habitats. The “Mobile pioneer dunes,” adopted in version Eur 15 of the Natura 2000 habitats document (Romao 1996) under code 2110, is equivalent to the association Euphorbio x Agropyretum (Géhu 1994) (association characterized by Euphorbia paralias and Agropyrum junceum or Elymus farctus). It is an open, perennial grassland with E. farctus (Géhu & Tuxen 1975). The “Mobile coastal dunes with Ammophila arenaria,” listed as code 2120 in Romao (1996), is equivalent to the association Euphorbio x Ammophiletum (Géhu 1994) (characterized by E. paralias and Ammophila arenaria). This is a community that colonizes dunes after the pioneer dune stage and that persists with heavy accretion of sand (Géhu 1969). The fixed dunes described under the term of “Northern fixed dunes with a vegetation of Galio-Koelerion albescens, Corynephorion canescentis” (2131) (Romao 1996) belong to the association Hornungio x Tortuletum (Géhu & De Foucault 1978). Also called gray dunes or mossy dunes, they are typified by a carpet of bryophytes dominated by Tortula ruralis ssp. ruraliformis and colonize relatively unstable parts of rear dunes (Géhu & De Foucault 1978). The aim of the restoration was to recreate the dune topography and facilitate the return to a landscape with all characteristics of an undisturbed ecosystem (including a pioneer dune, a mobile dune, and a stabilized dune with their associated plant communities).

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: A restoration program has been implemented on the Les Chevrets, L'anse Du Guesclin and Le Verger dunes since 1988. Wooden fences have been installed, and marram grass (Ammophila arenaria) has been planted using standard methods (Jacamon 1975; Despeyrou 1984; Boucheron 1987; Klomp 1989; Van der Maarel 1997). In some cases, initial landscaping was conducted (Duffaud 1998). The dune morphology and the vegetation were monitored from 1989.

After installing picket fencing around the whole of each dune system without soil preparation, the enclosures were immediately planted with marram grass over their entire area. The plants were kept in place and planted during the management day (April 1988) without other treatments.

The Les Chevrets dune, with an area of about 4 ha, had been heavily degraded before 1988 by a campsite and was re-landscaped before the start of restoration. The L'Anse Du Guesclin dune, also with an area of about 4 ha, is bounded to the rear by a road and had a high visitor pressure. The Le Verger dune has an area of about 2.5 ha and had been subjected to extensive sand quarrying.

At each site, two lines measuring 50m in length were set up from the beach to the rear dune. Three permanent parallel transects were installed at right angles to each of these lines as a function of their topographical position in 1989: one in front of the dune, the second at the summit, and the third in the rear dune. Topographical measurements were made from 1989 to 1998 using a theodolite. These provided information on the accumulation of sand from the beach to the rear dune.

Every year in June, the vegetation was surveyed using the permanent transect method (Daget & Poissonet 1971; Gloaguen & Touffet 1974). This linear method was chosen because it is well suited to the vegetation structure and was more reliable than measurements on quadrats. One hundred permanent points were distributed at 10 cm intervals along these transects, whose ends were marked by posts. The vegetation was recorded as the presence or absence of each species at each point. The frequency of the species in the 100 points provided an estimate of their cover. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: In terms of the dune topography, the installation of fences and the plantation of marram grass produced the desired results, as they have done elsewhere (Jacamon 1975; Despeyrou 1984; Boucheron 1987; Klomp 1989; Van der Maarel 1997). There was a progressive build-up of the topography in the front and at the summit of the dune. The very light sand accumulation in the rear dune significantly differentiated it from the front of the dune from 1992 and from the dune summit from 1993. The front of dune and the summit of dune became distinct in terms of sand accumulation from 1993, this being greater at the front of the dune than at the summit. This amounted to 2m in 9 years and could, in time, have formed a new dune ridge in front of the initial summit. 

In addition to the geomorphological structuring of the landscape, the front of the dune, the dune summit, and the rear dune were distinguished by their plant composition and species richness. Analysis of the plant cover was unable to discriminate between the landscape units over the 10 years. The overall cover of the dune increased from 1989 and then reached a stable level, varying around 75%. The species richness was, however, distinguished between the landscape units from 1992, with the exception of 1997. The rear dune was clearly distinguished. The front of the dune, the poorest zone, was clearly distinguished from the rear dune. The dune summit was significantly different from the rear dune from 1992 to 1996 and had an intermediate species richness between the front and the rear dune from 1998.

The Front of the Dune -- The plant community at the front of the dune was dominated by two perennial grasses: Elymus farctus and Ammophila arenaria. After 10 years, E. farctus became dominant, despite a brief decline in 1998, and the community became similar to the pioneer dune described by Géhu and Tuxen (1975). Among the seven species encountered, five are listed in the surveys of the pioneer dunes by Géhu and Tuxen (1975). Leontodon taraxacoides is associated with fixed dunes (Géhu & De Foucault 1978), and Conyza canadensis is a ruderal that does not belong to the dune assemblage.

The Dune Summit -- Ammophila arenaria dominated the dune summit. Its cover increased until 1995 and then stabilized at about 60%. Elymus farctus increased in the early stages of restoration but declined from 1993 to 1994. The vegetation became more diverse in the later stages, with the appearance of Festuca arenaria, Calystegia soldanella, and Vulpia membranacea.

Because of the dominance of A. arenaria, this community is very close to that of the mobile dune described by Géhu and Tuxen (1975). Five of the 15 species recorded in 1999 also occurred in the mobile dune association (Géhu & Tuxen 1975), eight others in fixed dunes (Géhu & De Foucault 1978), whereas C. Canadensis and Sonchus oleraceus are ruderals.

The Rear Dune -- The rear dune saw the greatest changes during the 10 years. Ammophila arenaria persisted with a cover of about 20%, but E. farctus declined from 1992. The vegetation became more diverse, and Festuca rubra ssp. arenaria became dominant from 1998. Tortula ruralis ssp. ruraliformis appeared in 1996 and constituted the first component of the cryptogam layer.

Among the 20 species encountered, 13 are listed by Géhu and De Foucault (1978) in fixed dunes, two in pioneer dunes, and the other five species reflect a ruderal tendency. Ammophila arenaria was still present, but the dominance of Festuca rubra ssp. arenaria, accompanied by Ononis repens, V. membranacea, and T. ruralis ssp. ruraliformis, differentiates it from the mobile dune of Géhu and Tuxen (1975). Tortula ruralis ssp. Ruraliformis was present but did not yet form the mossy carpet that characterizes the fixed dune (Géhu & De Foucault 1978). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The variation in species richness and floristic composition from one zone to another can be explained by abiotic factors such as salinity and the accretion of sand. The front of the dune is characterized by strong salinity constraints, indicated by both the dominance of lyme grass and the scarcity of marram grass, a species much less tolerant of salt stress (Boucheron 1987). Marram grass is strongly related to sand accretion (Jungerius & Van der Meulen 1997). Its loss of vigor in the rear dune can be explained by the low rates of sand accumulation that were recorded. In the rear dune the constraints related to being close to the sea and the instability of the soil decrease. Less specialized species appear, and the species richness increases.

Both in terms of diversity and structure, the rear dune remained clearly different from the association defined by Géhu and De Foucault (1978). Tortula ruralis ssp. ruraliformis was present but with a low cover that did not result in the formation of the moss and lichen carpet characteristic of fixed dunes. A species richness of about 13 species in a few square meters was described by Géhu (1997), but species richness did not exceed 11 species on average on project transects. At this part of the dune profile, the floral composition greatly depends on the local context. The occurrence of some nitrophilous plants that do not belong to the reference association reflects the strong human interference in the past. The lack of species typical of fixed dunes can be explained by the depleted seed bank after many years of degradation and isolation from seed sources--that is, intact fixed dunes.
For a long time the aims of dune management were concentrated on fixing moving sand. The proximity of human economic interests made it essential to control large-scale geomorphological phenomena and, especially, the drifting of sand into inland areas. The fixing of dunes is now well controlled, but a new challenge has come to the fore: the conservation of the natural character (Gadgil & Ede 1998). In dune restoration Sabino et al. (1993) distinguished two objectives: the restoration of the dune profile and the restoration of the original vegetation. Monitoring the restoration processes on the dunes of the Ille et Vilaine showed that these two mechanisms are independent. The implementation of restoration measures quickly led to a good plant cover in all the landscape zones. However, the conservation value and diversity only returned slowly, and the rate of return varied from one site to another.
The return to reference ecosystems involves a rehabilitation in which the succession passes through a transitory ecosystem: in this case, a plantation of marram grass. Marram grass provides a quick soil cover and builds up the dune height by trapping sand (KuÂ¨ hnholtz-Lordat 1923). It is very effective at restoring dune ridges, but it seems to slow the vegetation succession in the rear dune. This phenomenon was reported by Lemauviel (2000) and Lemauviel et al. (2003) in France, by Webb et al. (2000) in Australia, and by Poulson and McClung (1999) in Indiana with the American species, Ammophila breviligulata. The presence of marram grass is undesirable in a semi-fixed or fixed dune, where the preservation of conservation value is paramount. This plant helps maintain instability by trapping sand and by disturbing the soil by the movements of its leaves. Its presence indicates that the soil is not sufficiently stabilized. Marram grass is a good tool for restoring the topography, but it will take a very long time to restore the conservation value of the dune. These restoration procedures resulted in a vegetation cover on what previously had been bare soil and gave a conservation value to protected sites by combating degradation factors and visitor pressure. However, a return to a reference state (sensu Aronson et al. 1993, 1995) has not yet been completed. At the landscape scale the structures and the communities of pioneer dunes and mobile dunes have been restored. On the other hand, at the ecosystem scale, although the pioneer and mobile dunes have been restored, the fixed dune restoration is not complete but is in a correct trajectory toward restoration. Continued monitoring will be needed. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/france-restoration-of-floodplain-wetlands-in-the-mediterranean-region/	France: Restoration of Floodplain Wetlands in the Mediterranean Region	France	1995-09-01	2008-09-01	"Restoration of wetlands has become an increasing field of application of ecological research due to mitigation regulations, changes in agricultural practices and an increasing consideration of the role of wetlands in the water cycle. In areas where the history of human use of natural areas is old and intense, restoration projects must not only consider ecological objectives but also social aspects. The Vistre project was developed to answer a social demand of restoring the flood storage function of a riverine wetland, formerly drained and polderized for agriculture. The river is located in the Petite Camargue, southern France, and flows into the sea a few km downstream of the study site. Openings in the dykes, calculated after a preliminary study, partly restored the connection between the polder and the river basin. A monitoring program of flora and fauna was launched to test the hypothesis that the change in hydrological functioning would be sufficient to obtain the desired vegetation and fauna. During the first years of the project, high rainfall and uncontrolled openings of sluices due to difficulties with the local users caused abnormally high water levels. Thus, the vegetation changed to hydrophyte-dominated communities and was controlled mainly by the fluctuations in water level. The habitat objective for fish-eating birds was met and a large tree-nesting heron colony established. Solving the social problem and maintaining the sills should eventually allow most project objectives to be reached, although more slowly than expected.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The area was embanked in the 1950s, drained, and subsequently cultivated with rice, wheat, sunflower, and hay. Two polders were built, separated by a narrow strip of reedbed that remained non-modified. The polders were split into more than 50 plots separated by irrigation and drainage channels ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 m deep. In the last years before the start of the project, land use was rice field in the western polder, and dry annual crops and pasture in the eastern polder. A riverine forest dominated by Fraxinus angustifolia and Salix alba covered some of the large dikes surrounding the polders. The elevations of the plots ranged from âˆ’0.45 to +0.15 m ASL, except the dikes and circa 2 ha where dredged sediment from the navigation canal were deposited. In the Mediterranean region, restoration of wetlands in a restricted sense appears unrealistic because disturbance is very old, measured in centuries or millenniums, and hardly reversible. The main hydrological disturbances will generally not be removed (e.g. navigation canals, major rivers, embankments), and very little ecological information exists on the status before disturbance. Moreover, even small patches of natural areas are seen very much in an anthropocentric, utilitarian way for economical, social and ecological reasons. High social and economic pressures will allow the return towards less intensively managed ecosystems only when well-identified and highly demanded (desired) functions or services can be expected. Within this context, the aim of the present project was to create the conditions for the development of an ecosystem that would maintain itself with little continuous management effort. Placed on a new trajectory of natural succession (Aronson et al., 1993), the ecosystem would perform the different functions that are expected by the local users, and that may be expected from such a wetland.
Further objectives were to provide suitable feeding habitats for fish-eating herons and waterfowl during the breeding season, limited waterfowl hunting, and, after complete expansion of the reedbed, to allow extensive grazing by domestic herbivores during the summer drawdown. Thus, project objectives were not only determined by the need for restoring natural processes, but also by social demand.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
As soon as the area returned to public ownership, a strong social pressure developed around the project. On top of the initial objective of flood control, objectives related to hunting, thatching, potential grazing, fishing, and nature conservation were superimposed. They correspond to different hydrological regimes, which are not necessarily all compatible. The priority objective of flood control led to the decision for the level of sill; it is not, in all cases, optimal for other uses.

Description of Project Activities: The reference ecosystem was chosen as a riverine reedbed that should be dry by the end of summer in order to be able to receive the autumn and winter floods.

The internal ditches and levees were not removed and were thus supposed to contribute to the diversity of the site, providing a wider range of water depth and sources for further colonization (i.e. plants and fish). The flora and fauna were expected to colonize the area without specific intervention, and the economic use of the area by the local population (e.g. grazing and thatching) was dependent upon this colonization. Development of wetland vegetation was not expected to be limited by distance for colonization, as many species were already present as weeds on the agricultural land and along rivers and canals in, or connected to, the study site.

Completely removing the dikes would have resulted in permanent flooding and the objectives would not have been met. A summer drawdown was therefore chosen to enhance the flood control function, the vegetation dynamics, and the nutrient mineralization, and to allow summer grazing. The level at which dikes were lowered was calculated in a preliminary hydraulic study using an 8-year series of daily water levels in the navigation canal and meteorological information (Grillas, unpublished report). The level of the sills was calculated as a compromise between the flooding frequency in spring and the storage of water inside the polders. A higher level would have decreased flooding frequency but increased storage of water. On the basis of the preliminary hydraulic study, two openings (150 m wide, elevation +0.4 m ASL) were made in 1995 in the surrounding dikes of each of the two polders. Water level was monitored continuously (via limnigraphs) at three locations: (1) at the connection of the river and the canal, (2) in former east- and (3) west-polders. The preliminary study of the site included soil analysis, vegetation map and history of land use.

A 5-year ecological monitoring program of the site started in 1996, 1 year after opening the dikes. A detailed vegetation map was developed in 1996. In each plot, abundance of species was recorded according to a semi-quantitative scale (0, 0% cover; 1, cover below 20%; 2, cover below 40%; 3, cover below 60%; 4, cover below 80%; 5, cover below 100%; 6, cover 100%) in 1-m2 quadrats regularly spaced along three parallel transects. A second visit in late summer was made in the plots that had dried up during summer. Different censuses of target species were made: trees for their importance for birds (structure), an exotic species (Ludwigia peploides (Kunth) P.H. Raven, invasive species that constitutes an important threat for the Mediterranean wetlands), and a protected species (Leucojum aestivum L.). In ten plots, eight permanent transects 1 m wide were installed for monitoring the encroachment/regression of the fringes of reed that surrounded each former plot. Along each transect, the location of the fringe was calculated as the mean distance from a reference point to the five furthest living shoots. In two plots, large numbers of seedlings of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Steudel were found. In these plots, the density of seedlings was mapped in 1997. 

Viable seedbank was measured using the germination method in a greenhouse. On three former plots (ricefield, annual dry crops and pasture), 90 regularly distributed samples of sediment (4 cm diameter, 4 cm depth) were collected in spring 1996 and brought to the laboratory. The sediment of each sample was dispersed as a 1-cm layer on sand in a 15-cm diameter tray. Samples were sprayed with tap water every hour from April to November 1997. After being dried during winter in order to break possible dormancy of seeds, half of the samples per plot were submitted to the same spraying conditions described previously between March and July 1998. During the same period, the other half of the samples were flooded in tanks for hydrophytes which may not have germinated during the first trial. Seedlings were counted weekly and removed when identified. Unidentified plantlets were transplanted and cultivated until they could be identified. In the flooded treatment, only the hydrophytes were taken into account; other species could usually not grow through the water column and be identified. 

Water birds using the site were counted fortnightly during the migrating and wintering period (late summer to spring). During the reproductive season, the number of breeding pairs of colonial water birds were counted each year. The density of feeding herons was counted in 1997 in 17 visits between 30 April and 8 July along a fixed itinerary (line transect) representing a constant sample of both sectors. 

To establish a preliminary list of species, and determine the relative proportions per size class as an indication of food availability for fish eating herons, fish populations were evaluated during one field campaign in September 1997, combining electric fishing and passive fishinggears. At this date, most of the plots had dried, and water and fish concentrated in the ditches and canals. In large canals, nets with various mesh size, ranging from 10 to 60 mm, and traps (1.1 m long, 0.4 m diameter, mesh size 12 mm) were used during one night. Three nets and three traps were used in a large canal inside the site and in a branch of the neighboring navigation canal. Electric fishing was performed in five sites with an Albatros apparatus (Dream Electronic) for brackish water. Electric fishing was applied during 10 - 16 min for exhaustive capture on surface areas ranging between 65 and 150 m2 (intensity 4 - 10 A, Power 0.5 - 1.6 KW, according to electric conductivity of water 5 - 13 mS/cm). All large fishes, and a sub-sample of smaller ones, were counted and their length measured. Total biomass was evaluated per species. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: A 5-year monitoring program was launched in order to determine which processes were most important within such a project, and to measure ecological change at the site. Results presented here were obtained after the first 3 years.

The opening of the dikes and sill creation were followed by two winters with very high rainfall and floods. Floods expanded in the site, which served as a flood retention area. The water level in the sites was identical to that in the river when higher than the basal elevation of the openings (e.g. January - February 1996). When water level in the river dropped below this elevation, the wetland was disconnected from the river. The water level decreased progressively by evapo-transpiration and outflow through a valved drainage outlet. Decrease in water level in the former polders was almost linear as a function of the time elapsed since the last filling event, and the frequency of those events is hence a key parameter for the hydrological functioning. 

A total of 160 plant species were found in the plots and surrounding ditches and levees in 1996, the second year after opening the dikes. Six species were found in more than 40 plots out of a total of 51: Potamogeton pectinatus L., P. australis, Ceratophyllum demersum L., Paspalum paspalodes (Michaux) Scribn, Scirpus maritimus L. and Zannichellia pedunculata Reichenb. Except for the exotic species P. paspalodes, the most frequent species are submerged macrophytes and tall helophytes which can cope with the high water levels that followed the opening of the dikes. P. paspalodes is a C4 late growing species, requiring high temperature (Pearcy et al., 1981; Mesléard et al., 1993), and therefore, it grows late in the season when water levels are low. The species richness per plot exhibited a significant positive correlation with its elevation.

A total number of 31,200 seeds of 38 species germinated during the first phase and 6800 seeds of 16 species during the second phase. Only five new species were found during the second phase, three terrestrial species and two hydrophytes. Among these species, only Lotus corniculatus L. produced a significant number of seedlings (160). The spatial distribution of species was very heterogeneous and 70 samples of sediment were necessary to get 90% of the species per plot. However, all dominant species were found within the first 30 samples. The seedbank differed significantly between the three studied plots. In the former grassland, the seedbank was characterized by the largest mean number of species per sample, including more terrestrial species than in other plots. However, the total number of seedlings per sample was much lower than in the other plots. Conversely, the lowest mean number of species and number of terrestrial seedlings per sample characterized the former ricefield. The most abundant species that germinated from the seed bank in former grassland were Chara sp., Cyperus fuscus L., Aster squamatus (Sprengel) Hieron., L. corniculatus, Typha angustifolia L. and S. cf alba L.. In the dry crops, C. fuscus, A. squamatus and Polypogon monspeliensis L. (Desf.) dominated the seed bank, while in the former ricefield, C. fuscus contributed to more than 90% of the total number of germinations. For all species except Atriplex prostrate DC. and S. alba, the differences between plots were significant.

The most striking feature of the dynamics during the studied years was the gradual shift from terrestrial/amphibious vegetation to amphibious/aquatic communities. The grassland was dominated in 1994 by terrestrial grasses such as: Festuca arundinacea Schreber, Poa pratensis L., and leguminosae (Trifolium, Vicia, and Lotus). Two years after the project started, these species had disappeared and submerged macrophytes dominated (Chara sp., Z. pedunculata). Agriculture had been abandoned 1 year earlier in former dry crops than in other plots, and in 1995, wetland vegetation was already abundant with A. squamatus, A. prostrata, J. gerardii Loisel, P. australis, P. paspalodes, P. monspeliensis, S. maritimus, Spergularia rubra (L.) J. and C. Presl. The shortest and least flood tolerant of these species (e.g. Spergularia, Aster, Atriplex, and Polypogon) disappeared, while the tallest remained abundant (Phragmites, S. maritimus, T. angustifolia) and submerged macrophytes appeared (Z. pedunculata, Chara spp.). In former ricefields, many wetland plants--such as: S. maritimus, P. australis, T. angustifolia, and Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.--were present as weeds. Some of them maintained significant populations (P. australis, P. paspalodes, S. maritimus), although submerged macrophytes dominated in 1996 (P. pectinatus, C. demersum). In 1997, the plots were all permanently flooded, and no terrestrial plant was found. Although the specific composition of the seedbank was different from the actual vegetation in 1996, many terrestrial and amphibious species were still present as seeds. An additional soil sampling realized in 1998 will show whether those seeds are still viable after 3 years in flooded soils. Vegetative growth from the edges was expected to be the dominant process that would contribute to rapid colonization of P. australis. Aerial photographs and field surveys showed that reedbeds did not expand during the first years of the project. From the ten plots where the location of the fringe of the reedbed was measured, eight showed a regression of the reedbeds ranging between 0.7 and 3.4 m. In only one plot did the reedbed colonize 0.5 m, and on another there was no change. The depth and duration of flooding are probably responsible for this regression. There was no significant correlation between changes and elevation in the first year, but a significant trend to colonization on highest plots was observed over the 3 year period 1996 - 1998. Other factors, such as grazing by coypu and sediment characteristics, may have interfered with hydrological factors. In contrast, P. australis rapidly colonized the deposits of sediment where elevation is about 1 m higher than in the other plots and was very rarely flooded. Although seeds were found in the seed bank of the three sampled plots, abundant seedlings of P. australis were found in only two plots of rather high elevation (âˆ’2 and âˆ’3 cm ASL). In these two plots, density was high (up to 5 per m2), and most resulted from germination in 1995 and 1996. Those seedlings were deeply flooded in 1996 and 1997, and their growth was reduced. In better conditions, such colonization may lead to the very rapid development of a reedbed.

Birds used the site during summer as a feeding and/or breeding site depending on the species. A colony of tree nesting herons established right after the start of the project and is currently increasing. In 1996, 17 couples of night herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) nested, and the following year, the colony had 454 nests, among which were 222 Bubulcus ibis, 190 N. nycticorax, 25 Egretta garzetta and 17 Ardeola ralloides. Nesting success ranged from 2.3 (S.E. 0.45, n=18) for E. garzetta and 3.4 (S.E. 0.5, n=12) for A. ralloides. Fish eating birds were mainly herons plus ten couples of grebes (eight Tachybaptus ruficollis and two Podiceps cristatus). Bird counts on the fixed itinerary in 1997 showed that Ardea purpurea started using the area in May and had a stable number of individuals (15 to 20) till mid July. They used mainly the western half with about 2/3 of the individuals foraging in the plots and 1/3 foraging in the surrounding channels. A. cinerea was the most abundant, with a peak of 45 birds at the end of June, and the E. garzetta numbers were variable, ranging from ten to 30 individuals. Complete counts performed in September 1997 showed that total numbers were much higher, with 750 E. garzetta and more than 160 A. cinerea on the same day. At that date, A. purpurea had already left the site.

The establishment of a colony of tree nesting herons was difficult to predict, although the expected structure of the site was recognized as suitable and therefore, had not been identified as an objective of the project but rather considered as a possibility. The occurrence of breeding colonies of water birds is also strongly influenced by external factors such as the distribution of colonies in the region, the distribution of feeding habitats, the reproductive success and possible disturbances (Fasola and Alieri, 1992; Hafner and Fasola, 1992). The colony of tree nesting herons is large and it has now become a site of regional importance. This was probably promoted by the combination of several factors such as the low disturbance by visitors during spring, the suitable structure of the breeding habitat (and particularly the protection from the wind), and the abundance of fish at short distance. A general increasing trend for these fish populations further favored the establishment of the colony (Hafner and Fasola, 1997). The colony may persist even if the surrounding marshes dry up during the breeding season since two deep canals protect the site from predators. Similarly, after colonization by reed, the establishment of a colony of purple heron is possible on the site but would depend on similar external factors.

A total number of 16 species of fish were captured in the internal channels, and three additional species were found only in the navigation canal connected to the marsh during floods (Silurus glanis, Stizostedion lucioperca, Micropterus salmoides). The fish community was typical of littoral ponds and lakes or rivers with a slow current. The connection to the sea is highlighted by species that breed at sea (Anguilla anguilla, Mugil cephalus and Liza ramada). A remarkable feature is the abundance of exotic species, contributing to more than 90% to total biomass and 60% of species. Furthermore, two exotic crayfish species were also captured (Procambarus clarkii and Orconectes limosus). All the exotic species are considered naturalized, that is populations are maintained without permanent input of new individuals. The proportion of exotic species is much higher than usually found in other sites in the same region (Rosecchi et al., 1997). Due to late floods between the reproductive season and fish sampling, it cannot be demonstrated that some of these species reproduced on the site. However, it is very likely for some of them, according to the characteristics of the site and the species requirements (Gambusia, Cyprinus.). The size distribution of fish corresponds to the objectives of the project in providing suitable food for herons. Large numbers of fish are small enough to be caught by E. garzetta, and the range of size covers the requirements of the most abundant bird species. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The summer drawdown expected from the preliminary study and surveys was not obtained during the first years. The date of complete drying out calculated from the preliminary study was very sensitive to the date of the last flood, as drying out was a gradual process where evapo-transpiration dominated. Hence, the land was not dry in autumn, when the probability for flooding was the largest. However, at the end of September 1996, the water levels were low and the area still had 80% of its storage capacity. In 1997, water levels did not drop below 0 cm ASL, and storage capacity was only half of the maximum in late September. In 1996, there was enough time between the last spring and the first autumn filling events (about 3 months) to reach an ""˜almost dry' state. The decrease in water level after flood was enhanced by the installation of the valved drainage outlet. The exceptionally high rainfall in 1996 (more than 1000 mm compared to a 620-mm mean) was not the only reason for the observed results. Early-autumn floods contributed to reduce the duration of the dry period, and unauthorized manipulation of sluices resulted in summer flooding in both 1996 and 1997. Erosion promoted by an exotic rodent, coypu (M. coypus), lowered the sill level and caused water inflow to start when river level was 10 to 20 cm lower than the 0.4 m planned. The sluices were subsequently blocked, and a drier year in 1997/98 promoted a total dry out of the area like that expected from initial hypotheses.

The high water levels had multiple consequences on biota, and especially on vegetation dynamics. A slower than expected establishment of the amphibious vegetation was observed, along with a rapid dominance of submerged vegetation. To a large extent, the vegetation that developed in each plot was independent from the seed bank and the species previously present in the former agricultural land. The correlation between the composition of the seed bank and the vegetation is often weak in wetlands (Van der Valk, 1981; Wilson et al., 1993). Moreover, in the context of restoration projects, this correlation is expected to be even weaker as many species in the seed bank are agricultural weeds rather than wetland species. Most of the species that were found in the seedbank were terrestrial or short-lived amphibious species unable to withstand the high level and long duration of flooding. Among the species that were found in the site before rehabilitation, only a few were still present in 1996. Some species, such as the hydrophytes C. demersum or P. pectinatus, were abundant in 1996 but were absent from both the 1994 inventory and from the seed bank. They were, however, present in 1994 in the permanent internal canals. Those canals formed a network of wetland vegetation patches among the former polders, which facilitated their colonization. Very few species that had not been found before in the site were observed during the 1996 inventory (e.g. Najas marina L.). They probably have colonized during floods. As hypothesized initially, the abiotic conditions, mainly flooding stress, determined the dynamics of the vegetation. This result highlights the impact of the abiotic factors on the species composition and dynamics of vegetation, and their predictive value for restoration of wetlands and planning (Weisner, 1991; Martinez-Taberner et al., 1992; Palmer et al., 1997).

Water depth and duration of flooding are often identified as dominant factors controlling the distribution of species in wetlands (e.g. Spence, 1982). Increase in water level can result in changes in the species composition of vegetation (Wallsten and Forsgren, 1989; Van der Valk et al., 1994; Crivelli et al., 1995). Terrestrial species are the most sensitive, followed by emergent species. Submerged species have a higher tolerance for an increase in water level, and they are mainly limited by light attenuation and wave action. In this case, the impact of increased water depth was probably enhanced by the high turbidity which further reduces light availability. The dominance of hydrophytes after 2 years resulted partly from the low cover of helophytes (Grillas, 1992). Reed was affected more than what was expected. The water depth in the site was within the range P. australis can stand in continental freshwater marshes (Haslam, 1972; Squires and Van der Valk, 1992) or in Mediterranean brackish coastal wetlands (Mauchamp, unpublished data). Possible causes for the regression of Phragmites were the anoxia caused by permanent flooding and eutrophication (Weisner and Graneli, 1989; Armstrong et al., 1996). The Vistre River feeding the wetland is heavily polluted by urban wastewater and agricultural runoff. Moreover, slightly brackish water occasionally enters the marsh. This may contribute to an increased richness in sulphate and the production of deleterious sulphide in anoxic conditions (Armstrong et al., 1996). The survival of the rhizomes of P. australis during floods, and their further growth, are favored by the presence of unflooded stems which conduct air to the rhizome and remove metabolic gases (Weisner, 1988; Brix, 1990). Winter flooding and wave action may have damaged old stems and prevented oxygen from reaching the rhizomes (Coops et al., 1994). During the last year, lower water level resulted in new vegetative colonization of P. australis, although it was reduced by higher salinity (Hellings and Gallagher 1992). P. australis should dominate in the future, as hypothesized in the preliminary study, although the process will be much slower than expected.
This project was an opportunity to test the ability to rebuild a wetland ecosystem and make predictions on its dynamics.
About 3 years after opening the dykes, the objectives of the project were only partly met. A number of technical and social difficulties, related to the multi-users character of the site, resulted in higher water level than expected in the initial plans. The level of the sill in the former dyke should be maintained at 0.4 m or slightly higher in order to achieve objectives. These problems seem to be nearly solved and the hydrological situation to be approaching the expected passive functioning, depending on climate and fluctuations of sea level. Although the objective of restoring the flood storage function is widely accepted among the local population, there remain some difficulties to accept the natural fluctuations in water level resulting from the rehabilitation project.
All biological compartments and human-use of the area have been impacted by the hydrological situation. However, the initial hypotheses linking the abiotic situation, the vegetation dynamic and fauna appeared to be verified to a large extent, and project results support the hypotheses that in wetlands, predictions on vegetation structure can be established on the basis of abiotic conditions, assuming that competitive output is correlated with plant maximum height. The establishment of the expected hydrological situation should result in colonization by P. australis. Special attention must be given to this species, as it controls several functions and services that are expected from the wetland. Low water quality might result in reed colonization being limited to shallower water than expected, thus promoting the maintenance of open water in deeper parts of the wetland. The area does not have a sufficient enough size to solve the flood problem at a regional scale, but this is intended to be a pilot project encouraging and facilitating other projects. The flood control function was supposed to be obtained with a minimum permanent cost, and hence a minimum management effort on the long term. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/kenya-shimba-hills-forest-landscape-restoration-project/	Kenya: Shimba Hills Forest Landscape Restoration Project	Kenya	2004-08-28	2006-08-28	"The Shimba Hills Forest Landscape Restoration Project was undertaken in 2004 by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Lafarge Group to restore degraded stands of Kenya’s coastal rainforest adjacent to the Shimba Hills Reserve. These forests have been badly degraded as a result of pressure from encroaching human populations, and it is hoped that in addition to community tree nurseries and buffer-zone seedling plantations, practitioners can begin effecting lasting restoration measures through outreach activities and sustainable management practices. The project has placed much emphasis on reducing the demand for forest resources by reshaping local subsistence activities and building economic alternatives into the restoration model.Deforestation, Mining & Resource Extraction The Shimba Hills Reserve is surrounded by poor farming communities that place tremendous anthropogenic stress on forest resources, extracting firewood, harvesting edible and medicinal plants, encroaching on forested lands, etc.
A high population of roaming elephants (numbering approximately 700) is also a significant cause of degradation, as they damage vegetation and threaten endangered plant life. The Shimba Hills Ecosystem is part of the World Wildlife Fund’s Eastern Africa Coastal Forest Ecoregion, and is one of the world’s 25 biodiversity hotspots. More than 50% of the 159 rare plants in Kenya are found in the Shimba Hills, including several endangered species of cycad and orchids. The region is also a nationally important site for birds and butterflies, and it contains Kenya’s only population of the Sable Antelope. Elephants, giraffes, buffalo, Roan Antelope, black and white colobus monkeys, warthogs, and serval cats are also found in the Shimba Hills. The objectives of the project are:
To work in collaboration with local communities in the restoration of degraded forests adjacent to the Shimba Hills Reserve.
To develop sustainable (and where possible) alternative livelihoods for forest-dependent communities that emphasize wise and balanced utilization of the ecosystem.
To ensure the applicability of the Shimba Hills Ecosystem Management Plan to the wider landscape around the reserve by providing effective methods for the implementation of its participatory component.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
A management committee was created under the auspices of the project in order to bring together key stakeholders and organize outreach activities. One of the project’s primary foci was reducing pressure on forest resources through capacity building for alternative livelihoods. Toward this end, educational materials were created; incentives for community tree planting were introduced; and stakeholder workshops were held to encourage collaboration in conservation-related activities.
As a result of training provided for communities in pilot villages, community meetings (barazas) are now being held to build environmental awareness and popularize participatory planning, thereby helping to develop a common vision for the use and management of forest resources. These communities are also planting trees on their farms in order to meet their subsistence needs for poles and fuel wood and ease pressure off the forests. Furthermore, school and youth groups are being encouraged to start their own tree nurseries to supply seedlings for the replanting of denuded areas. The tree species being promoted for use are intended to provide other services to the communities, such as: fuel wood, fodder for livestock, fruit trees, beekeeping, and production of handicrafts and wood carvings.

Description of Project Activities: The following activities were encompassed by the project:
--Completion of the Shimba Hills Ecosystem Management Plan
--Establishment of buffer-zone tree plantations along the boundary of the Shimba Hills Reserve
--Construction of 4 water tanks and installation of rainwater harvesting systems at 2 primary schools in the target communities
--Plantation of 12,000 seedlings at 6 schools in target communities around the reserve
--Presentation of 10 community sensitization workshops around the reserve 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Approximately 33,000 seedlings have been planted in the target area to date. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The most likely factor to limit recovery is the same that has precipitated degradation: anthropogenic pressure stemming from local subsistence activities.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: These coastal forests are central to local livelihoods, as they provide water, wood for fuel, medicinal plants, and other needed goods and services. As such, their health and longevity is crucial for the economic solvency of local communities.
The following strategies have been envisaged to ensure the results of this project and expand its applicability to neighboring areas:
–Extend project sites to cover the whole perimeter of the Shimba Hills National Reserve
–Extend buffer zone plantations along the whole reserve boundary
–Produce tree and tree nursery management guidelines
–Enhance community tree nursery support
–Enhance community livelihood support to all communities along the reserve boundary (e.g. beekeeping, butterfly farming, etc)
–Initiate enrichment planting within the reserve
–Initiate innovative farmland protection against wildlife damage
–Continue annual Stakeholders workshops
–Sustain and strengthen project management committee "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/spain-la-restauracion-del-rio-alharabe/	Spain: La Restauración del Río Alhárabe	Spain	2008-08-28	2008-08-28	"La cuenca del río Alhárabe con sus 40 Km de arroyos es una zona de riberas degradadas en las que se está llevando a cabo un proyecto de restauración y recuperación de la vegetación de ribera. Este proceso practicaría la reintroducción de árboles y arbustos de ribera autóctonos de la zona. Además, para mayor potenciación y virtud ecológica, se consideró plantar prioritariamente especies que estuviesen en peligro de extinción. Los motivos de esta repoblación son muchos, y todos aumentan la biodiversidad y la riqueza paisajística del paraje. Gracias a la restauración que se está efectuando, crecerán bosques con distintas tonalidades de verde, que en otoño oscilan entre el rojo y el amarillo, hasta perder la hoja durante el invierno. De manera esquemática, como vegetación potencial y objetivo en la cuenca del río Alhárabe, puede hablarse de una primera hilera de sauces, una segunda algo más alejada compuesta por álamos y chopos, y una tercera que compondrían olmos y fresnos. También se han introducido otras de fuerte raigambre cultural en la zona, como la higuera, y otras como álamos blancos y tarays. Estas repoblaciones son la avanzadilla que creará las condiciones adecuadas para la regeneración natural, o para posibilitar la realización de posteriores plantaciones de enriquecimiento con más especies debajo del bosque que ahora crece. Queda todavía mucho trabajo por hacer: se trata de una actuación puntual (8.000 Ha de cuenca, es decir, 0,42 % de los 18.630 Km2 de la cuenca del Segura) en el conjunto de repoblaciones que se vienen realizando en los ríos y ramblas de la Región, con el fin de mejorar su calidad como hábitat por sí mismos, para la fauna, y para disfrute humano de la Naturaleza.Agriculture & Livestock Es una zona donde las riberas del río y arroyos se encuentran muy perturbadas, prácticamente sin vegetación de ribera, que aparece a retazos y de modo puntual. En las zonas más frías del territorio de actuación destaca la presencia de sabinares, en concreto de sabina albar. Los pinares también están presentes, sobre todo el pino laricio, aunque en menor medida. También hay presencia de pino rodeno y carrasco. En zonas más resguardadas pueden aparecer pequeños macizos boscosos mixtos de caducifolios con arces, mostajos y quejigos, a los que acompañan gran número de especies espinosas y arbustos caducifolios como el rosal, el agracejo, el endrino, etc.
Existe otro tipo de vegetación que no está tan influenciada por el clima general de la zona, sino que depende de la especificidad del medio. En este caso se trata de la vegetación ribereña que se encuentra condicionada por el agua freática disponible y las condiciones especiales de los ecosistemas riparios. Se pueden encontrar también restos de bosque de galería en esos suelos de fondo de valle de gran riqueza agrícola que hemos descrito anteriormente. El paisaje ha sido trasformado desde tiempos inmemoriales por el hombre, tanto, que la vegetación sólo aparece inalterada de modo muy puntual en el río Álharabe y sus principales afluentes, que cuentan con presencia de agua durante todo el año. El proyecto se realizó con el fin de repoblar los cuarenta kilómetros de cauce que no tienen vegetación y dar continuidad a la flora ya existente para potenciar la belleza paisajística e incrementar la biodiversidad de este peculiar paraje. También se pretende el restablecimiento de corredores entre espacios naturales y lugares para el encuentro y disfrute de la naturaleza.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Se parte, en cualquier proyecto forestal, del análisis profundo del territorio en el que se va a actuar: la orografía, las características climáticas e hidrológicas de la zona, etc. Cuando se trata de una repoblación, toda esa información nos permite acotar cuál es la vegetación potencial para la actuación, la más evolucionada que sería capaz de establecerse o que existía antes de que el quehacer del hombre la degradase. 

En este caso concreto, en el que se persigue la restauración de la cubierta vegetal de la ribera de un río, hay dos condicionantes principales a saber: la profundidad a la que se encuentra el agua en el suelo, nivel freático, y la frecuencia de avenidas extraordinarias del río cuyas orillas se pretende restaurar. De manera esquemática, como vegetación potencial y como objetivo a alcanzar en la cuenca del río Álharabe, puede hablarse de una primera hilera de sauces (Salix sp.) en contacto con la lámina de agua del río, una segunda algo más alejada compuesta por álamos y chopos (Populus sp.) y una tercera que compondrían olmos y fresnos (Ulmus minor, Fraxinus angustifolia). Además de estas especies se han introducido otras de fuerte raigambre cultural en la zona, como la higuera, y algunas adaptadas a tramos muy concretos en los que aparecen suelos con la salinidad oportuna, como álamos blancos y tarays (Tamarix sp.), capaces de desarrollarse en esas condiciones tan difíciles para las plantas.

La selección de especies y la forma de disponerlas ha sido un proceso concienzudo y de gran preocupación por recabar el material de reproducción, estaquillas y plántulas, en zonas de análogas características. Con ello se garantizaba la preparación para la fuerte mediterraneidad del territorio a repoblar, con intensos fríos en invierno y un largo periodo estival de sequía. Así, todo el material fue recogido en la misma cuenca del Alhárabe, o, en caso de no haber disponibilidad, se ha recogido de otras zonas del noroeste de Murcia con las mismas condiciones bioclimáticas y biogeográficas. Por último, el material fue llevado a viveros donde se preparó para la plantación.

El periodo de plantación lo marcaron las primeras lluvias de otoño. En ese momento, el suelo coge algo de humedad y la planta puede establecerse en condiciones menos adversas. Para facilitar el arraigo de las especies que se han plantado, los hoyos en los que se colocaron fueron hechos con retroexcavadora, que permite un mejor acceso al nivel freático, y facilita que las especies pudieran sobrevivir en los duros meses de verano, cuando la disponibilidad hídrica y de irrigación es mucho menor. Además, estas especies se han incluido en lo que se denominan 'riegos de socorro' durante los dos primeros años, por si acaso las medidas anteriores no fueran suficientes. Se trata de un apoyo que se da en los meses de verano para ayudar a las plantas hasta que éstas sean capaces de sobrevivir por ellas mismas.

Ciertas operaciones complementarias a la plantación se definieron con la intención de que la repoblación no limitase los usos agrícolas y ganaderos que se vienen dando en el territorio. Un ejemplo claro es la distribución de la planta, siempre a menos de cinco metros del cauce para operar dentro de los límites del Dominio Público Hidráulico, o el uso de protectores de malla, de hasta metro y medio, para que el ganado pueda seguir pastando sin perjudicar, con su mordisqueo, el crecimiento de los árboles y arbustos. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: En total se ha repoblado a lo largo de más de 30 Km, en la cuenca del río Alhárabe, en el término municipal de Moratalla. El chopo lombardo ha sido la planta protagonista, pero junto a ésta se han utilizado fresnos, sauces, etc, hasta un total de quince especies diferentes y cerca de 50.000 plántulas a lo largo del cauce principal y los arroyos y ramblas que a él llegan. 

Debido a que la repoblación se realizó con especies de ribera de crecimiento rápido, los resultados, si todo se desarrolla dentro de los plazos previstos, serán espectaculares y en muy poco tiempo.

Las ventajas que tiene repoblar a todo lo largo de un río en un contexto como el que se ha descrito son muchas y variadas. Para hacer una relación de ellas, lo ideal es contemplar los resultados de la repoblación a distintos niveles. 

Si nos situamos en el Campo de San Juan, dentro de unos años, lo primero que debe saltar a la vista es la clara mejoría del paisaje. Gracias a la restauración que se está efectuando, en medio de la basta planicie de cereal crecerán bosques de ribera con distintas tonalidades de verde que en otoño oscilarán entre el rojo y el amarillo hasta perder por completo la hoja durante el invierno. Si disminuimos la escala y contemplamos de una vez toda la Región de Murcia, podremos ver toda una red de bosques en los que se conservan gran cantidad de especies protegidas por su singularidad e interés. Es decir, a esta escala observamos un salto cualitativo y cuantitativo del nivel de biodiversidad con la introducción de especies que conlleva esta repoblación. Y, por último, si nos alejamos hasta el nivel de la cuenca del río Segura, podemos percibir las mejoras ocasionadas por la repoblación desde la perspectiva hidrológica, ya que disminuye la velocidad de las aguas, con ello su agresividad erosiva, y así disminuye la producción sedimentaria arrastrada por el agua.
Queda todavía mucho trabajo por hacer: se trata de una actuación puntual (8.000 Ha de cuenca, es decir, 0,42 % de los 18.630 Km2 de la cuenca del Segura) en el conjunto de repoblaciones que se vienen realizando en los ríos y ramblas de la Región, con el fin de mejorar su calidad como hábitat por sí mismos, para la fauna, y para disfrute humano de la Naturaleza. Si bien es cierto que estas actuaciones lineales de repoblación no bastan por sí mismas para crear un bosque de ribera. Es de destacar que éstas se enmarca dentro de un grupo de iniciativas creadoras de las condiciones adecuadas para la regeneración natural o para posibilitar, como mínimo, la realización de posteriores plantaciones de enriquecimiento con más especies debajo del bosque que ahora crece.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/argentina-atlantic-forest-restoration-in-iguazu-national-park/	Argentina: Atlantic Forest Restoration in Iguazú National Park	Argentina	2001-08-27	2008-08-27	"This project was initiated in 2001 with the support of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and its partner organization the Fundación Vida Silvestre Argentina (FVSA) to reconnect and restore fragmented stands of Atlantic Forest in the tri-national Upper Paraná eco-region of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. This region is of vital importance in maintaining connectivity among four key parks: Iguaúu National Park in Brazil, Iguazú National Park in Argentina (both Heritage Sites protecting the world famous Iguazú Falls), and the Urugua-í and Foerster Provincial parks of Misiones, Argentina. Restoration treatments have targeted privately owned agricultural land representing a dangerous bottleneck for biodiversity, and more than 20 hectares are currently being restored in the municipality of Andresito. Not only have experimental trials allowed practitioners to evaluate the efficacy of different techniques, the project has yielded extensive data on the dynamics of native species regeneration and has facilitated collaborative relationships with local agricultural producers. Alternatives for sustainable land management are being explored (i.e. organic and under-story yerba mate production), and it is hoped that this project will serve as a regional model for balancing the livelihoods of local communities with the needs of vital forest habitats.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation The Upper Paraná region of the Atlantic Forest once covered approximately 471,000 square kilometers of northern Argentina, eastern Paraguay, and southwestern Brazil. Today only 7.81 percent of the original forest cover remains. Primary causes of ecosystem degradation and fragmentation include soy bean cultivation, cattle ranching, yerba mate plantations, and monoculture plantations of exotic tree species (principally Pinus spp., Eucalyptus spp., and Araucaria angustifolia). The provincial government of Misiones estimates that between 1992 and 2003, the area under cultivation increased from 7300 ha to 283,000 ha. In spite of its highly fragmented condition, the Atlantic Forest remains one of Earth’s most biologically diverse ecosystems, containing about 7% of the world’s species. The southwestern portion of the Atlantic Forest encompasses the Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest eco-region and extends along southwestern Brazil to eastern Paraguay and the Misiones Province of northeastern Argentina. This tri-national eco-region has the largest remaining forest blocks and provides rich habitat that still harbors the jaguar (Panthera onca), puma (Felis concolor), and ocelot (Felis pardalis). Other common mammals include the tapir (Tapirus terrestris), coati (Nasua nasua), and four species of monkeys (Cebus apella nigritus, Alouatta caraya, Alouatta fusca fusca, and Leontopithecus chrysopygus). In addition, about 500 species of birds are found here, including five species of toucans. The Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest eco-region also constitutes an important source of freshwater and plays an important role in the conservation of watersheds. –To evaluate the ecological and economic efficiency of different forest restoration techniques.
–To develop a recovery model of forest productivity based on the sustainable use of palmito (Euterpe edulis) and yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis), two species with considerable importance for local livelihoods.
–To restore forest cover in target areas and thus help re-establish connectivity among isolated patches.
–To develop and test monitoring methods applicable in landscape-scale restoration projects.
–To capacitate local community members in forest restoration and rehabilitation practices and techniques.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Training and public outreach targeting local landowners and community members has been a top priority throughout this restoration effort, as practitioners hope to raise awareness in the region and encourage restoration and conservation activities on neighboring farms. Project results and alternative farm management strategies have been reported to members of the Organic Agriculture Net, the Ecology and Natural Resources Ministry of Misiones Province, and local producers from around the area.
Meetings were organized in 2006 with members of the Yerbatera Yapeyú Cooperative to discuss a variety of topics related to farm management, and some member producers have since begun implementing agro-ecological practices on their farms (i.e. using native tree species). These farms were visited by project staff to obtain firsthand knowledge of the producers’ experiences and assess the efficacy of agro-ecological management in the study area. The visits also aided practitioners in determining which farms were most appropriate for further rounds of discussion and technical support.
Through these and other networking and training activities, practitioners hope to secure the active and on-going participation of local producers and achieve a gradual restructuring of farm management practices such that biodiversity and forest conservation go hand-in-hand with local agricultural productivity.

Description of Project Activities: This project is concerned with testing and evaluating several different restoration techniques in order to determine the extent to which different factors and processes influence the regeneration of these native forests and which restoration treatments are most effective in accelerating its recovery. The treatments thus far implemented have focused on eliminating ""barriers"" for regeneration (e.g. herbivory, compacted soils, agriculture, etc.) and have been carried out primarily on abandoned grazing lands, forest edges invaded by prolific native species, and yerba mate plantations. Fieldwork was conducted in Andresito and Eldorado (Misiones Province) on local farms belonging to different families of producers.

A tree nursery was constructed in 2001 on a farm in the study area, and local producers from Andresito and Eldorado were trained in the production of native species saplings and plantations. Other local community members, who were specially hired for this area, were trained in the installation of restoration treatments and their monitoring.

Four abandoned pasturelands were treated by first eliminating grasses (identified as a barrier for regeneration) using a machete over the entire plot. High densities of rapid growth pioneer species were then planted, along with seedlings of native trees produced in the nursery. These species are functioning as regeneration ""facilitators,"" creating shade to decrease grass cover and encouraging the colonization of other tree species (Holz y Placci, 2006). Clean-up of planted sites was carried out periodically (as demanded by grass growth) by hoeing within a radius of 30 cm around each sapling. 

These treatments are intended to ascertain the density of pioneer species necessary to inhibit grass growth and stimulate natural regeneration, as well as to determine the effectiveness of eliminating grasses from treated plots at the outset of restoration.

The regeneration of border areas in forest fragments was another focus of the project. These ""edges"" are generally overgrown with native invasive species, such as ""tala"" (Celtis spp.) and bamboo (Chusquea ramosissima and Merostachys clausenii), which impair regeneration and emphasize the ""border effect."" Management of border areas is an important component of restoration planning, as it not only decreases the border effect in given patch, but also mitigates the species imbalance in the larger forest ""matrix."" Although borders are generally considered unproductive areas, clearing them of invasive species may help increase their profitability, as it encourages the natural regeneration of more marketable species (e.g. palmetto--used for palm hearts) and provides space for shade-tolerant cultivates such as yerba mate or pineapple. 

Two different trials were conducted in forest edges to test these projected outcomes. In the first, ""tala"" was cleared and crops of yerba mate planted in order to evaluate the production of yerba mate in cleared edges and in plots with forest cover. In the second, bamboo was cleared to assess rates of natural regeneration and determine whether the sowing of palm seeds was necessary to increase density at these rehabilitated edges.

The last type of treatment conducted by practitioners was plantation of native species in ""yerbales""--monoculture plantations of yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis). Although it is currently cultivated as a monoculture, yerba mate is a native tree species that once formed dense patches within the jungle, until they disappeared as a result of overexploitation (Devoto y Rotkugel, 1936). This is a species that can develop in the shade of other trees, and since yerba mate production is one of the most important economic activities in the region, native tree plantations on yerba mate fields afford many benefits. The cover of native forest is increased while simultaneously improving the profitability of yerba mate fields because yerba mate production can be complemented by firewood and timber production. Moreover, soil quality is enhanced by the increased organic matter and nutrient potential.  

Trials were conducted in yerbales to evaluate native species growth and survival within these systems and to assess the effect of these plantations on yerba mate production. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Most species planted on the abandoned grazing lands showed a high rate of survival (between 75% and 100%) or a medium rate of survival (between 25 and 50%). Relatively few species showed low survival rates (between 25 and 50%). Only Euterpe edulis showed very low survival rates (lower than 25%). 

It was observed in the trials affecting forest borders that the areas where ""tala"" was eliminated were speedily colonized by native trees of rapid growth--principally Trema micrantha and Solanum verbascifolium. Recent monitoring has evidenced a great number of saplings of other species of native trees now growing in these places as well. Tala removal with bulldozer and rake has proven efficient, as few tala saplings have been found and the invasion seems to have been stopped. Given the invading capacity of this species, however, the long-term efficiency of this method remains to be seen. 

The edges where lianas and bamboos were cleared have not regenerated to date. However, during quick monitoring, a very important increase in natural regeneration of native tree saplings was observed.

The results of trials at yerba plantations seem promising. The plantations that were not weeded over long periods showed considerable natural regeneration in the yerba rows, and during quick monitoring rounds, several saplings of native species were seen growing among yerba mate plants. It is worth mentioning that moisture and lower temperatures are better kept in yerba rows than in the rest of the yerba mate plantation. This fact, coupled with lower trampling and weeding impact on the site, could aid natural regeneration and make yerba plants ""regeneration nuclei"" within these systems. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Results obtained through intensive monitoring at the abandoned grazing fields suggest that the negative effect of grass on seedling survival may be of varying intensity depending on the dominant grass type in the matrix. At the studied sites, sapling survival was lower on the parcels dominated by Urochloa decumbens and Urochloa brizantha--both exotic species identified as invasive--than on parcels covered mainly by Axonopus compressus and Paspalum urvillei. 

On the other hand, it also seems that species are affected by grass in different degrees. On the parcels dominated by signal grass, all species were significantly affected; whereas on the other parcels, it was observed that the survival of the pioneer species Solanm verbascifolium was higher compared to species of later successional stages (Peltophorum dubium and Balfourodendron riedelianum). Survival of Luehea divaricata (intermediate successional stages) was higher than that of the pioneer species Trema micrantha.

As regards growth, results showed that the presence of grass negatively affected the growth of tree saplings, which coincides with the findings of other researchers (Holl, 2000). However, it did not influence the T. micrantha as much as other species. Although trials only reflect the ""net"" effect of grass competition--and not the ""interference"" mechanisms (e.g. shadowing, nutrients limitation, allelopathy, etc.)--looking at studies carried out in other areas, these results are mainly explained by competition between grass and saplings for nutrients (Buschbacher et al., 1988; Nepstad, et al., 1990; Reiners et al., 1994) and water (Ashton et al., 1998).

Yerba mate saplings planted during forest edge treatments exhibited high rates of mortality. This high mortality is mainly attributable to a strong drought that occurred during late spring 2003 and the summer of 2004. Surviving yerba saplings have grown slowly and have larger and thicker leaves than those found in traditional open-air single crops.

Plantations of native tree species in yerba mate monocultures exhibited considerable mortality. Sapling mortality occurred primarily during yerba mate harvesting and as a result of weeding. In 2004, all treatments were planted anew in order to compensate for dead saplings and thus maintain the initial density of the sites. As in the grazing land plantation, saplings that were smaller in size when planted died in larger numbers. However, some saplings deemed dead during quick monitoring later sprouted new shoots and continued growing.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Andresito producers keep growing saplings of native species for their own farms and for trade. Through the management of local NGOs, they have also agreed to sell their ""yerba"" production to an American company which deals in shade-grown organic ""yerba."" This will imply a marked increase in their profits, since revenue from the production and sale of organic ""yerba"" will be three times higher per ton than current earnings. From a conservation standpoint, this initiative is very important since it will allow trees of native species to be planted inside the ""yerba mate"" monocultures, and thereby contribute to an increase in the surface area of the forest.
If the results of this project are compared with those described in other studies in the ecoregion (Holz et al., 2001; Stutz de Ortega, 1987), after 20-30 years of natural regeneration, the structural characteristics of secondary forest (i.e. basal area, aboveground biomass, etc.) should be expected to approach those of the older forest. In fact, such rapid recovery of structural parameters has been recorded in various studies carried out in tropical secondary forests (Saldariaga et al., 1988; Denslow y Guzman, 2000; Peña-Claros, 2003; Muñiz-Castro et al., 2006). Several authors have pointed out that in secondary forests, vegetation picks up fast and the nutrients it feeds on are soon returned to the land through leaves falling and decomposing, which makes them highly productive systems (Brown y Lugo, 1990; Feldpausch et al., 2004).
In spite of these findings, management and intervention in the early stages of natural regeneration would be an effective and economic way of ensuring a more expeditious and complete restoration of slightly degraded areas. Periodic monitoring and subsequent management would then follow and would facilitate an adaptable and responsive approach that removed obstacles to forest regeneration and encouraged a sustainable relationship between local communities and their surrounding natural resources. Practitioners are working closely with the Yerbatera Yapeyú Cooperative of small-scale yerba mate producers to implement some of the production/restoration models developed through this and other similar projects on their farms. A series of meetings and workshops have been organized with the cooperative to discuss various aspects of general forest and farmland management. Some objectives and tasks are now in place to be developed in the coming months and years.
It is the aim of practitioners to continue disseminating the results of their research and developing activities to train larger groups of local producers and technicians in the restoration and recovery of vital forest resources. It is expected that by increasing the local capacity to drive these processes of forest restoration and rehabilitation, the long-term conservation of the region’s biodiversity will be ensured. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/portugal-cork-oak-forest-restoration/	Portugal: Cork Oak Forest Restoration	Portugal	2004-03-26	2005-02-26	"The Southern Portugal Green Belt project was undertaken as part of the larger WWF Mediterranean Cork Oak Landscapes Programme to restore the cork oak forest landscape at two pilot sites in Southern Portugal. Spanning the Portuguese provinces of Alentejo and Algarve in an area of exceptional natural value extending 8,000 km2, the restoration targeted cork oak forests belonging to the warm and humid mixed-oak forest type–dominated by cork-oak (Quercus suber). The project aims to increase forest surface and improve the structure and density of forest habitats through tree/shrub production and plantation and effective long-term management practices. This will facilitate the natural regeneration of the cork forest stands and ensure sustainable livelihoods for local community members while protecting the region’s biodiversity.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The health and longevity of cork oak forests is heavily dependent upon management practices revolving around the manufacture of cork bottle stoppers to supply the wine industry. Unfortunately concerns about tainted corks in recent years have helped increase the popularity of synthetic stoppers (i.e. plastic and metal screw tops), and it is estimated that between 2000 and 2005, cork-stopper sales fell worldwide by nearly 20 percent. Portugal, in particular, has seen a considerable decline in cork-stopper exports to Australia and the US. The resulting devaluation of cork oak forests has meant less incentive to effectively manage and preserve them and growing threats from fires, disease, overgrazing and conversion for agricultural production. Cork oak habitats have been ranked among the most valuable habitats in Europe and have been listed in the EC Habitats Directive. Not only are they a vital source of income for thousands of people, they support one of the world’s highest levels of forest habitat biodiversity. Plant diversity can reach as high as 135 species per square metre–many of these having aromatic, culinary or medicinal value–and a high degree of endemism occurs in these floral communities. Undergrowth is thick with heathers, leguminous plants, rock roses and herbs, and more than 30 different brackens are found here.
In addition to their rich and varied flora, cork oak forests also support tremendous faunal diversity that includes: spiders, spadefoot toads, geckos, skinks, vipers, mongoose, roe deer, boars, genets and a plethora of avian species. Wintering birds from northern Europe, including virtually the entire common crane population, arrive by the millions to find shelter in the cork oak landscapes of the Mediterranean, and storks, kites, vultures, buzzards, booted eagles and short-toed eagles also congregate here.
Cork oak landscapes also provide important habitat for several threatened and endangered species. The Iberian lynx is the most endangered cat in the world, with only an estimated 100 individuals left, and cork oak forests are one of the habitats that afford it food, shelter and breeding grounds. The Spanish Imperial eagle, one of the world’s four most endangered birds of prey (represented by only 150 breeding pairs), is also a regular inhabitant of these forests. To develop ecological restoration guidelines for cork oak forests and promote management techniques that reconcile nature conservation and natural resources management.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
A number of important stakeholders support the Southern Portugal Green Belt project and are now collaborating in its implementation. Partnerships have been formed between WWF, the regional Algarve reforestation commission, the farmers’ association of Monchique, the CBA-FFUL research institution, and local NGOs. In addition to organizing field visits and presentations for local farmers, the project has included training workshops to disseminate restoration methodology and forest management techniques to a variety of participants. For instance, in November 2004, a one-day applied workshop on tree nursery production techniques for native species from cork oak forests was organized by WWF in Mertola; and NGOs, landowners and foresters involved in the WWF cork oak forest projects in Portugal, Tunisia and Morocco were invited to attend. As a follow-up to the workshop, a two-day field visit through the green belt area was organized to share project experiences, restoration results at the 2 project sites (Monte de Vento and Herdade da Ribeira Abaixo), and information about other sites where restoration is foreseen (e.g. Monchique and Cladeirao). It is hoped that the involvement of these key stakeholders, and the participation of local farmers, will help generate needed resources and expand the restoration effort.

Description of Project Activities: Restoration of the cork oak landscape was undertaken at two pilot sites. The first, Herdade da Ribeira Abaixo, is a 221-ha farm located in the Cercal/Grandola Natura 2000 site and owned by the Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture. This farm is managed by the Centre for Environmental Biology (CBA) Research Station of the University of Lisbon. The second site is Monte do Vento, located in the Guadiana Valley Natural Park and owned by the Associaúão de Defesa do Património de Mértola (ADPM), a local NGO. This site consists of 198 ha of holm oak and cork oak woodlands.

Acorns were collected in Monte do Vento and Herdade da Ribeira Abaixo at the beginning of January 2004. Seven thousand acorns were planted in the Monte do Vento tree nursery (owned and run by the ADM) between January and February 2004 for later use at the 2 sites. In addition, during the period March to May 2004, 3,000 native plants (Arbutus Unedo, Cercis siliquastrum, Punica granatum and Fraxinus angustifolia) were produced in the tree nursery to increase biodiversity in the restoration areas. Moreover, between December 2004 and February 2005, 15,000 native plants of various species were prepared for the restoration work to be undertaken in 2005 after the closure of the project funded by the Nando Peretti Foundation. 

Based on the detailed methodology and restoration plan developed, fieldwork was executed on 13 ha at Monte do Vento and on 15.5 ha at Herdade da Ribeira Abaixo. Work began in May 2004 with the preparation and cleaning of the project sites. At HRA, this preparation included the selective removal of invasive species in July 2004. Project executants were contracted in September 2004, and vegetation control and soil mobilization activities took place in November. Cork oak saplings were planted in November 2004, along with other nursery-reared species, and the saplings were inoculated with fungi to improve plant health and soil structure. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: A total of 25,000 plants (including: Quercus suber, Q. faginea, Fraxinus spp., Arbutus unedo) were produced by the tree nursery. 4,500 saplings were planted at Monte do Vento in November 2004, and 10,000 saplings were planted at HRA in November 2004. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Drought in winter and high temperatures in summer damaged many of the saplings at Monte do Vento. The Monte do Vento team will be following up with continued actions (i.e. planting during spring and autumn) and maintenance.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: In addition to cork production, the cork oak forest landscapes provide an important range of non-timber forest products--especially pasture for livestock, honey, mushrooms, acorns, berries, medicinal and aromatic plants, and game. These products are of considerable importance in national and international markets and contribute substantially to livelihoods in the rural economy. Valuable environmental services, such as soil conservation, water protection, carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation, are also provided by cork oak landscapes.
This was a successful pilot project producing achievements that can be developed and built upon. The project team has developed proposals for fundraising to continue the work at the two sites (i.e. monitoring & maintenance of field work), and in addition, the success of the project has led to an expansion of the restoration strategy into other areas of the Green Belt. Support for these initiatives has been obtained from the Algarve reforestation commission, and a new project is planned for Monchique (a burnt area) that will be conducted in partnership with the Monchqiue landowners cooperative, Pulp companies like Celbi and Portucel, and the local NGO Vicentina. WWF is also in discussion with LPN (an NGO active in the Caldeirao region that is currently implementing a project to protect the Iberian Lynx) in hopes of developing a strategy for restoring vital habitat for the Lynx. Under the auspices of its Cork Oak Landscapes Programme, which aims to protect, manage and restore cork oak landscapes in the Southwestern Mediterranean, WWF will ensure the sustainability of results produced by this pilot project and will continue to disseminate these results, via its partners in Portugal, throughout the Mediterranean and beyond. In addition to project activities implemented during this 1-year pilot project, WWF and local partners have invested much energy in securing funding for the expansion of restoration work into other at-risk sites (e.g. Monchique and Caldeirao).
In fact, during a press conference at HRA in November 2004, the reforestation commission officially agreed to fund a restoration project in Monchique. The project was scheduled to begin in June 2005 and, like the pilot project, will involve many local stakeholders.
A pilot restoration plan for Caldeirao was also under discussion with other parties involved in nature conservation (i.e. The Iberian Lynx Project managed by the Portuguese NGO LPN) and was to be undertaken in association with current development projects in this Natura 2000 site (i.e. the cork oak forest management project led by the local NGO In Loco).

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/chile-restoration-of-araucaria-araucana-forests-in-region-ix/	Chile: Restoration of Araucaria araucana Forests in Region IX	Chile	1997-08-22	2008-08-22	"The Villa Las Araucarias forest restoration project was undertaken in the Nahuelbuta Mountains of Chile’s Region IX to restore several hectares of threatened Araucaria araucana forest. Exotic species plantations of Pinus radiata, together with livestock grazing and agricultural disturbances, have reduced these forests to a fraction of their original size and have left only isolated stands of the rare and endemic A. araucana. In collaboration with local landowners and community members, project managers chose four sites for restoration and helped establish a small, community-run nursery to provide seedlings for the effort. The revegetation of project sites was accomplished through both direct seeding and seedling transplantation, and results thus far suggest higher rates of success for the transplanted plots. This has left participants feeling optimistic about the possibilities for managing a community-run nursery to further restoration and conservation efforts in the area.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation A. araucana forests in the project area have been severely degraded by anthropogenic pressures, and in a period of just 50 years, the total area of these forests has decreased from 1000 ha to 50ha. Livestock grazing, soil disruption resulting from agricultural activities, and fires set for agricultural clearance have been important deleterious agents, but exotic-species plantations (mainly Pinus radiata) are becoming the primary cause of degradation. Nearly half the project area is covered by these mono-specific plantations (46.9%), such that A. araucana has been limited to small, fragmented stands and even isolated trees in many instances. According to CONAF et al. (1999), the total area of A. araucana forest types in Chile is of 253,713.6 ha. Approximately, 97% of this area is situated in the Andean Range, and only 2.9% occurs in the Coastal Range. In the coast of the IXth region (where the present project is situated), a small proportion of the total area of A. araucana can be found (approx 1.3%).
Of these A. araucana forests in the Coastal Range, approximately 65.9% are situated on private property, and thus the State (SNASPE) protects only 34.1%. The lack of protection for these coastal forests is a cause for concern among conservationists and researchers, as they possess unique genetic characteristics not found in other stands of A. araucana. To create a pilot restoration area for A. araucana and train local community members in the production of plants and the realization of restoration activities.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Project activities were undertaken with the collaboration of local people from the Villa Las Araucarias community. The construction of a greenhouse, collection of seeds, plantation of A. araucana, installation of fencing, maintenance of project sites and control of access to the plots was all coordinated with the help and participation of these community members.
The project also afforded an opportunity for 9 university students to work directly with the community and gain experience in forest restoration, in hopes that they will help promote similar restoration initiatives in other parts of the rural sector.
As a result of negotiations done by project leaders, a network of public and private stakeholders has been created to coordinate in-situ conservation strategies for A. araucana forest in the project area. The network involves governmental institutions (e.g. the National Forest Service, the National Environmental Office, and the Agriculture Office), local communities, timber companies, and universities and is working together to identify future A. araucana conservation activities.

Description of Project Activities: In the project area, four 1.0 ha permanent plots were established and enclosed with fencing to prevent the encroachment of cattle (one of the main threats to the A. araucana forests). Plots 1 and 4 were established in a mixed forest of Pinus radiata and A. araucana, while plots 2 and 3 were established in an A. araucana-Nothofagus dombeyi forest.

In January 2003, ten female A. araucana trees were identified by project researchers and local community members for cone collection. Each tree was labeled with correlative numbers in order to monitor the following characteristics: dbh (diameter at breast height), total height, canopy cover, health status, and number of cones. The age of each tree was then measured by extracting increment borers. A total of 50 cones (equivalent to 34 kg) were collected from the labeled trees in April 2003 with the collaboration of local people, representing a total of approximately 3,300 A. araucana seeds (corresponding to about 344 satisfactory seeds per kilogram).

By the end of March 2004, a total of 8,500 seeds had been collected from trees located in the project area, and a portion of these seeds were propagated in the new greenhouse built in Villa Las Araucarias during the next sowing season (July 2004). Owing to the particular genetic characteristics of the A. araucana population in the project area, 100 seeds were donated to the Arboretum of UACH to establish an ex-situ collections of threatened Chilean species. The rest of the seeds were used in diverse research investigations, including an analysis for an undergraduate thesis.

The number of seeds collected per kg was lower in 2004 than in 2003, due to an increase in the size of seeds collected in 2004. Similarly, cones harvested in 2004 were larger than those collected in 2003. 

In April 2004, a 60 m2 greenhouse was built on the property of Mr. Antonio Allende, the leader of the Villa Las Araucarias community after an agreement between project leaders and Mr. Allende was signed in order to ensure the proper maintenance and production of plants. The main objectives of this greenhouse are: the propagation of A. araucana plants and other accompanying species which will be used for conservation and ecological restoration works in the project area; the involvement and training of local people in the techniques of propagation of A. araucana; and the sale of plants by the community to generate income for themselves. In addition to the involvement of Mr. Allende, three members of the community were trained in the construction of the greenhouse and the preparation of beds for sowing.

From the 3,000 seeds collected in March 2003, 2,000 seeds were stored at the Seed Laboratory of the Universidad Católica de Temuco (UCT). On the 30th of June 2003, these seeds were treated for stratification process in wet sand for 60 days. By the end of August 2003, these seeds were sown at the UCT's nursery, and their mean germination rate was 33% by January 2004. 

Between August and September 2003, plantation of seedlings and direct sowing of seeds were carried out at three permanent plots established at Villa Las Araucarias in 1999. The plantation was conducted on two permanent plots (1 and 2) which exhibited two different levels of protection: a) 100 seedlings in plot 1 with side protection given by the canopy of remaining A. araucana and Nothofagus dombeyi trees, and b) 100 seedlings in open ground (i.e. without protection) in plot 2. Transplanted seedlings were two years old and were produced from seeds collected in the same area. 

In the permanent plots 2 and 4, a total of 1,000 seeds were used for direct sowing in August 2003. In plot 2, one or two seeds were sown in each cup, and a total of 300 seeds were sown in sites with protection and 300 seeds in sites without protection. In plot 4, 400 seeds were sown with protection. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: A low germination rate (2%) was recorded in the direct sowing survey of plot 4, and seeds of plot 2 did not germinate. This low germination was probably due to fungi attack. Plantation activities showed better results, however, and seedlings exhibited a very low mortality (16% of the 100 seedlings transplanted in plot 1 and 18% of the seedlings in plot 2). By the end of March 2004, 52% of the seedlings in plot 1 and 43% of the seedlings in plot 2 were considered healthy. In plot 1, seedling mortality began one month later than in plot 2, and this pattern of mortality is best explained by differences in the micro-site and canopy protection. Whereas plot 1 is characterized by a steep slope and protection from some remaining trees, plot 2 is a flat, open site. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Site conditions are very adverse due to the presence of thin soils and high rainfall, which causes an increase in the water table during winter. In summer, the low water availability and high temperatures may cause severe damage to the plants and affect their growth and survival. Owing to these extreme site conditions, it is important in the nursery phase to produce strong, resilient seedlings and thereby reduce the levels of mortality.
The restoration work conducted at Villa Las Araucarias has met with initial success, registering a low mortality rate in the first year. However, propagation techniques must be improved in order to ensure better establishment of plants at the site. Extreme conditions of drought and flood also need to be considered in the preparation and conditioning of nursery-reared plants for the project area. In this sense, further research and experimentation is needed in order to ensure the success of future restoration work.
Although direct sowing exhibited low germination rates, owing mainly to the soil restrictive conditions of the study area, this method should still be considered in the future as an option for restoring degraded A. araucana sites–particularly in very thin soils where plantations will not succeed. More research is needed to provide specific guidelines about the implementation of direct sowing as method for restoration. Between August 2003 and February 2004, several meetings were held with some of the landowners whose properties have stands of A. araucana in order to enlist their help in the conservation of A. araucana habitats. Thus far, five landowners have signed formal agreements to protect A. araucana on their lands, and measures taken under this project affected two of the five properties under agreement. Future activities should include restoration work on the other three properties. One of the five owners under agreement is a large forestry company that has expressed interest in working with project personnel and in obtaining plants from the new greenhouse for restoration activities elsewhere on its land. It has also agreed to develop conservation strategies for other threatened species occurring in the area (e.g. Berberidopsis coralline).
As a result of negotiations between project leaders and government representatives, an area of 5 ha owned by the State will soon be transferred to Villa Las Araucarias, enabling the local community to conserve and restore this area covered with a remnant A. araucana forest. Thus, future restoration activities have been identified as a continuing priority for this area.
In January 2004, Rainforest Concern (London, UK), under the coordination of the Universidad Austral de Chile (UACh) and Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (UK) staff, purchased 161.5 ha of A. araucana forests with the aim of ensuring their conservation. It is expected that the conservation area will be expanded to include neighboring areas as well, as an additional purchase was envisaged for May 2004. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/canada-manitoba-tallgrass-prairie-restoration-on-agricultural-fields-removed-from-cultivation/	Canada: Manitoba: Tallgrass Prairie Restoration on Agricultural Fields Removed from Cultivation	Canada	1987-08-21	2008-08-21	"Initiated in 1987 by the provincial government of Manitoba, the Beaudry Park restoration project aims to restore native tallgrass prairie to sections of three agricultural fields removed from cultivation. With more than 120 hectares reseeded between 1987 and 2000, and a future restoration site still under cultivation, Beaudry Park is the largest and longest-running project of its kind in Canada and is yielding valuable data about vegetative succession and the relative efficacy of prairie restoration methodology. Of particular interest is the finding of a 2002 study that although mid-aged restored plots were relatively high in species diversity, older plots exhibited a decline in the number of species and a lack of forb cover. These findings suggest that in spite of initial successes, many desirable species are not becoming established and that current management practices may need to be modified.Agriculture & Livestock Until 1986, approximately 225 ha of parkland were leased for agriculture. Beaudry Provincial Park was created in 1975, and now comprises 950 ha of riparian forest and upland habitat. Lowland forest adjacent to the river is dominated by Populus deltoides (plains cottonwood), Acer negundo (Manitoba maple), Ulmus americana (American elm), and Tilia americana (basswood). Remnant tallgrass prairie and savannah in the park are characterized by Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem), Spartina pectinata (prairie cord grass), Dalea purpurea (purple prairie clover), Symphoricarpos occidentalis (western snowberry), and Quercus macrocarpa (bur oak). To restore tallgrass prairie on agricultural fields removed from cultivation in Beaudry Provincial Park.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: From 1987 to 2000, sections of three agricultural fields were sequentially removed from cultivation along a north-south gradient, tilled, summer fallowed, and seeded with prairie species. Seed was collected from local prairie sites within a 180 km radius of Beaudry Park using a manual harvester. This was supplemented by commercial seed (Prairie Habitats, Argyle, Manitoba) and seed grown at the park. Mixes had high proportions (85%) of grass seed by weight (Berg, 1992; Morgan, pers. com.). Reseeding of sites into standing vegetative cover has been infrequent, occurring twice at site 98 and once at site 99, where successful establishment of vegetation from a previous seeding was compromised by flooding (Friesen, pers. com.). These sites are also mowed repeatedly in the summer to control exotic species, including Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle) and Sonchus arvensis (perennial sow thistle). Commonly, patches within all restoration sites are mowed to control invasive exotics Melilotus alba (white sweet clover) and Melilotus officinalis (yellow sweet clover). Prescribed burning is conducted every 5 years and always in early spring. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Three sites were randomly selected for analysis in each of the following classes: (i) those seeded between 1987 and 1990; (ii) those seeded between 1991 and 1994; and (iii) those seeded between 1995 and 1999. In addition, three unbroken remnant prairie sites were identified and analyzed as target reference points (i.e., reference sites).

Species diversity differed substantially between restored and reference sites. Overall effective species richness was significantly higher in reference sites than restored sites, as were native species richness and effective species richness (ESR). In contrast, exotic species richness and ESR were significantly higher in restored sites.

Species diversity was also affected by time since restoration. Overall species richness and ESR were highest in reference sites and were significantly lower in old and new restored sites. Interestingly, mid-aged restoration sites had significantly higher overall species richness than other restored sites. Differences in vegetation response became more apparent when species origin was examined. Native species richness and ESR differed significantly across all four age classes, being highest in reference sites, lower in mid-age and old restorations, and lowest in young restorations. In contrast, exotic richness and ESR predictably were highest in new and midage restorations and significantly lower in reference sites. Native evenness was lowest in reference sites and highest in old restorations, whereas exotic evenness was significantly higher in reference sites than in all restorations.

Species composition differed substantially between reference and restored sites, and also among restored sites, and further separated sites into distinct clusters. Reference sites were characterized by native Bouteloua curtipendula (side-oats grama), Amorpha canescens (lead plant), S. pectinata, Galium boreale (northern bedstraw) and D. purpurea. The future restoration site was characterized by exotic ruderals Brassica kaber (wild mustard) and Malva rotundifolia(round-leaved mallow). Restored sites were characterized by natives Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem), Anemone canadensis (Canada anemone), and Potentilla arguta (tall cinquefoil), as well as exotics Thlapsi arvense (stinkweed), Phleum pratense (timothy), Amaranthus retroflexus (redroot pigweed), and Pastinaca sativa (wild parsnip).

Young restoration sites were characterized by exotics Echinochloa crusgalli (barnyard grass), Chenopodium album (lamb_squarters), and Sonchus asper (annual sow thistle), and early successional natives Elymus canadensis (Canada wild rye), S. scoparium, and Ratibida columnifera (prairie coneflower). Old and mid-age restorations were characterized by exotics C. arvense and Alyssum
alyssoides (alyssum), and prairie natives Agastache foeniculum (giant blue hyssop), and Rudbeckia hirta (black-eyed susan).

Twenty-four species were significantly affected by time since restoration. Of these, 11 (45.8%) were seeded native species, four (16.7%) were non-seeded native species and nine (37.5%) were exotic species. Ten native species were primarily associated with reference sites, including prairie natives Artemesia ludoviciana (white sage), G. boreale, Solidago canadensis (Canada goldenrod), S. pectinata and woody species G. lepidota, Rosa spp. and S. occidentalis. Five exotic species were primarily associated with young restoration sites: C. arvense, M. alba, Polygonum convolvulus (black bindweed), S. arvensis and Taraxacum officinale (dandelion). Species that dominated older restorations included natives A. gerardii and Solidago rigida (stiff-leaved goldenrod), as well as exotics Bromus inermis (smooth brome) and Medicago sativa (alfalfa). Importantly, 10 seeded native species were not significantly affected by time and remained present in at least two age classes. These species seem to have been successfully established and included: Achillea millefolium (yarrow), A. canadensis, E. canadensis, Erigeron lonchophyllus (Fleabane), H. maximiliani, and Monarda fistulosa (wild bergamot) (data not shown). Two non-seeded native species, Aster ciliolatus (Lindley_s aster) and Convolvulus sepium (hedge bindweed), also had become successfully established.

Similarity between restoration and reference sites generally increased with time. Overall similarity increased in the first 7 years since restoration initiation, but did not change thereafter. When species origin and growth form were considered, similarity of native seeded graminoids and native species that had been seeded in some restoration sites and self-recruited in others increased linearly with time-since-seeding. Similarity of native seeded forbs increased for the first 7 years, but decreased thereafter. Exotic species showed no significant changes in similarity.

To determine the effects of restoration on soil properties, reference, restoration, and future restoration sites were compared. Although affected by restoration, changes in these variables were much smaller than those of vegetation. Soil phosphorus was significantly higher in restoration and future restoration sites than in reference sites. Soil sulphate was also significantly higher in the future restoration site than in restoration and reference sites, and soil nitrate also tended to be higher. In contrast, organic matter was significantly higher in the reference sites than in other sites. These differences in soil composition are likely a result of past agricultural activities. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The high diversity of mid-age (8 - 11 years) restorations relative to both new (3 - 7 years) and old (12 - 15 years) restoration sites suggests that desirable species had not become established in new sites, whereas old restorations appear to have lost species. Similar results have been observed in other tallgrass prairie restorations (e.g., Kindscher and Tieszen, 1998; Baer et al., 2002; Sluis, 2002). At Beaudry, increases in similarity between restoration and reference sites only occurred for the first 7 years. Likewise, 41% of seeded species were observed in mid-age restorations, whereas only 26% remained in old restorations. These changes suggest that simple ""˜""˜sow-and-stop'' revegetation will not likely recreate high-diversity natural habitat and that these sites will require ongoing maintenance if they are to continue recovering.
Beaudry is one of the largest and longest standing tallgrass prairie restorations in Canada, and represents an important opportunity to examine the long-term impacts of prairie restoration on ex-arable land. Our results suggest that nearly 20 years of restoration have had desirable impacts on diversity and species composition at Beaudry, but this habitat will require ongoing restoration. Analyses of the Beaudry Park project show that many of the older sites are losing species and thus, that this restoration should be understood as an ongoing process that requires a long-term commitment. Many of the species in decline tended to be forbs, which may reflect the use of grass-dominated seed mixes. However, the use of such mixes is common in tallgrass prairie restorations, as these are generally cheaper and more accessible (Sveinson, 2003). The resemblance of mid-age restorations and reference sites in our study suggests such mixes may successfully be used in prairie restoration. However, increasing dominance of grasses over time should be addressed by modification of management practices subsequent to establishment. Frequently, limited resources and convenience lead to spatially and temporally uniform management practices and over-reliance on a few routine maintenance activities, regardless of age, location, or soil status of restoration sites. This may facilitate the expansion of competitive native and exotic grasses and decrease the importance of less common species (Sveinson, 2003). Reduction of the scale of maintenance activities may aid in increasing restoration heterogeneity.
Colonization might be enhanced by small-scale disturbance, including patch mowing or spraying of herbicides on dominant C4 grasses, minimally disturbing soils, and interseeding of native forbs. Use of vegetative propagules, such as A. gerardii rhizomes collected from mature sites, could also facilitate establishment in new restorations while reducing grass dominance in older sites. Vegetative propagules have been successfully used in marsh restoration, yielding over 90% survival and extensive vegetative spread after four growing seasons (Fraser and Kindscher, 2001). These and other small-scale post-seeding activities will likely increase structural complexity and native forb diversity, and thus warrant further exploration (e.g., Sveinson, 2003). "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/latvia-floodplain-restoration-for-european-union-priority-species-and-habitats/	Latvia: Floodplain Restoration for European Union Priority Species and Habitats	Latvia	2004-10-01	2008-06-30	"This EU LIFE project encompasses 16 priority floodplain meadows in Latvia representing a combined area of 14,085 ha. The project sites, not previously addressed under other nature conservation initiatives, are all of unique regional, national and international importance and harbor the best floodplain meadows in the country, including 50% of its Fennoscandian wooded meadows and over 6530 ha of alluvial forests. These meadows provide crucial habitat for several priority bird species–chief among them the Great Snipe (Gallingo media)–and although restoration methodology varied in accordance with specific site characteristics, the interventions were all aimed at rehabilitating fragmented and overgrown meadows in order to protect and expand this habitat. Practitioners actively enlisted the help and support of local landowners and land managers in every phase of the project, and the ongoing management of project sites depends largely on the participation of these stakeholders. While monitoring activities thus far conducted on the restored floodplains show an overall increase in the populations of target species, a more accurate assessment of the project’s success must await longer-term trends and analyses.Fragmentation, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Because these floodplains are regularly inundated, they have never been used for intensive agricultural production. Instead, most areas were partly drained during the 20th century to increase hay production for livestock. Beginning in the 1980s, however, the need for hay decreased dramatically, as collective farms operating under the socialist system collapsed and the number of cattle decreased more than 2 fold. Consequently, the majority of these floodplain meadows were abandoned, and their habitat value has since declined due to the lack of management.
In the absence of cutting and grazing, overgrowth affects all types of meadows present at the sites. Bushes and trees are now invading these meadows and decreasing the area of suitable habitat available to important bird species. In fact, large areas of former floodplain meadows have gradually turned into shrub lands and even forests.
Fragmentation is another problem threatening the project sites. Drainage ditches now overgrown with bushes have become dense tree/shrub belts that divide once-continuous meadows into narrow strips. Although these belts themselves may not occupy large areas and may not significantly reduce the total area of the meadow, they diminish the effective meadow area, or core area, and result in less extensive habitat for target species. This, in turn, results in significantly lower population densities and decreased total population size in these areas.
These tree/shrub belts also serve as perches for avian predators (e.g. Corvids), as well as sources of seed for further shrub dispersion. Moreover, they increase the proportion of shaded areas in these meadows and create unfavorable conditions for light-demanding plant species, thereby altering vegetation structure and reducing species richness. All 16 project sites represent typical floodplain meadow areas that are more or less regularly flooded. These meadows are restricted nature areas of critical importance for several globally threatened species, and they host Latvia’s highest breeding densities of the LIFE priority bird species Crex crex (Corn Crake) (400-685 individuals) and Aguila pomarina (Lesser Spotted Eagle) (59-120 individuals), as well as a third of the Latvian Gallingo media (Great Snipe) population (59-120 individuals). To restore 15 of the most ecologically significant floodplains and Natura 2000 sites in Latvia in order to ensure favorable conservation status of several EU protected habitats (wooded meadows, floodplain meadows, lowland hay meadows, etc.) and species (Corn Crake (Crex crex), Great Snipe (Gallinago media), Lesser Spotted Eagle (Aquila pomarina), Hermit Beetle (Osmoderma eremite), etc.).
To engage local landowners in the long-term management of project sites and encourage stewardship of important habitats and species.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Since the project’s longâˆ’term management and success are highly dependent upon agricultural stakeholders, project planners are promoting the new agroâˆ’environment schemes in Latvia and are helping farmers apply for them. The participation of over 400 farmers has been actively solicited, and study tours, educational seminars and oneâˆ’onâˆ’one discussions have been organized where appropriate to stimulate interest and involvement.

Description of Project Activities: All habitat restoration work took place outside the bird nesting season (1 April to 15 July), and in 95% of cases, landowners were contracted to carry out the restoration work. Although more difficult to coordinate and administer, this approach will help increase the sustainability of project results by involving land managers and local stakeholders from an early stage.

Habitat restoration was conducted using the following methods:

--Bush cutting took place over approx 1100 ha across all project sites. Bushes were cut using a chainsaw or bush-cutter, and stubs were left as short as possible--not more than 5 cm--to allow for post-restoration meadow management. 
--Uprooting carried out in small areas as an experiment to prevent the sprouting of already cleared bushes. Roots of the cut bushes were either shredded or extracted using appropriate machinery. In total, uprooting of bushes took place over an area of approx 9,55 ha in the Burga Meadows, Lake Burtnieks Meadows, Sita and Pededze Floodplain, and SvÄ“te Floodplain.
--Wooded meadows that had long been overgrown were restored by removing shrubs around oak trees. A portion of the bushes was removed the first year and the rest the year after in order to gradually expose the oak trees to increasing amounts of light. Restoration of wooded meadows was conducted on 60 ha in the Vidusburtnieks, Sita and Pededze Floodplain, Mugurve Meadows and Pededze Lower Reaches.
--Fencing was installed in the Lake Burtnieks Meadows and the Lielupe Floodplain Meadows to contain grazing animals. In Burtnieki, floodplain meadows are grazed by purebred horses of the Burtnieki horse farm, and in the Lielupe meadows (situated in central Jelgava), grazing is done by Konik horses acquired in cooperation with the Dutch ARK Foundation. The project also helped reinstate grazing in the Dviete Floodplain and the Sita and Pededze Floodplain with the help of financial contributions from local landowners. In these two floodplains, grazing is done by wild animals.
--Controlled burning was a method employed at 11 project sites over an area of approx 380 ha. This method was used only for very overgrown sites and only after specific site management plans had been devised. In cases where other options were not feasible, the burning of cut bushes was also performed on site. Controlled burning was not applied in the Lielupe Floodplain Meadows, Kalnciems Meadows, RaÄ·upe Valley or Lake Durbe Meadows.
--Initial mowing was the most extensive (about 2250 ha altogether) and most frequently used floodplain meadow restoration method. It was applied in floodplains where, in spite of having been abandoned for a number of years, bushes were not sufficiently dense for cutting. Initial mowing was combined with bush cutting in many cases, and was carried out in one of the following ways:

--Manual mowing is the most expensive and most time consuming, and it was therefore used only in sites where no other options were available due to poor access or wet conditions. It was also used to remove sprouts after bushes had been cut.
--Mechanical mowing followed by the removal of cut grass was used at sites where there was a use for hay and where possibilities for its removal existed.
--Although it is not the most ecologically sound method, grass produced by mechanical mowing was often shredded and left at the site. In many cases, this was the only feasible choice for meadow restoration, so in lieu of leaving the site unrestored (i.e. as a developing scrub), it was decided to restore this way. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Floodplain restoration was carried out over an area of 2400 ha. As a result, favorable conservation status was enhanced for the following habitats of European importance: species-rich Nardus grassland on siliceous substrates; Boreal alluvial meadows; eutrophic tall herb communities; lowland hay meadows; etc. Restoration of wooded meadows--a rare and protected habitat in Latvia and Europe--was achieved by removing bushes surrounding oak trees. Removal of undergrowth around oaks also created a suitable environment for the populations of the Hermit Beatle (Osmoderma eremite) found within the project sites.

The effectiveness of floodplain meadow restoration and management measures has been assessed using the number of nesting birds. Bird monitoring was begun in 2004 and continued for the duration of the project. The monitoring was carried out using a uniform methodology and focused on counting the globally threatened Corn Crake (Crex crex) and Great Snipe (Gallinago media), along with other indicator species. The results thus far demonstrate an increase in the populations of the project's target species, as a positive trend has been observed in the numbers of both the Corn Crake and Great Snipe. In fact, comparisons between the number of these birds within the project sites and in the country as a whole demonstrate that floodplain restoration efforts have been successful. Although the number of singing Corn Crake males at project sites decreased in 2006, the change was less marked than in the rest of the country, and their increase the following year was more rapid. Furthermore, around half of Latvia's population of breeding Great Snipes is currently found within the project sites; and while there has been an overall drop in their population since the inception of monitoring in 1999, the number of Great Snipes on restored floodplains has actually increased--boosting figures for the country as a whole. Floodplain restoration measures and subsequent site management have also taken place in areas that are suitable feeding grounds for the Lesser Spotted Eagle (Aquila pomarina) during its nesting season, and for waterbirds and waders during their migration. Thus, a favorable impact on the populations of these species is expected as well. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: In spite of ongoing monitoring efforts and preliminary indicators of success, the full extent of recovery (along with any limiting factors) will not be known for some time to come.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Not only did this project provide a temporary solution to unemployment by involving local people in restoration activities, it is assisting landowners in obtaining subsidies to more effectively manage their resources and is affording local communities a valuable opportunity to become more active in shaping land use policies.
The results obtained in the course of this project will provide considerable help for River Basin Administrations in formulating the goals of water status in the 16 selected sites of NATURA 2000. Sustainability of the project results can only be achieved with the assistance of knowledgeable and motivated landowners. Hence, an important aspect of the project was to educate the landowners and involve them in project activities from the outset. Training on EU subsidies available through the agro-environment scheme of the Rural Development Program was offered between 2006 and 2008, and study trips to Estonia, Finland and Sweden were also organized. Site management plans and educational leaflets were also prepared and disseminated to raise awareness and encourage stewardship.
As a result of these outreach activities, the owners of restored floodplain meadows and landowners who were contracted to assist with the restoration are now educated and committed to long-term floodplain management. The health of these biologically valuable grasslands will depend upon extensive grazing and mowing to control shrubs and other prolific colonizing species. Financing for the ongoing maintenance will be obtained primarily through agro-environment payments for biologically valuable grasslands under the Rural Development Program.
To encourage floodplain management outside the restored sites, an informative brochure was distributed across the country in an attempt to garner public support and ensure greater participation in these conservation initiatives. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/canada-british-columbia-kennedy-flats-watershed-restoration-project/	Canada: British Columbia: Kennedy Flats Watershed Restoration Project	Canada	1994-08-19	2008-08-19	"Kennedy Flats Watershed is located in Clayoquot Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, Canada. Much of the watershed was logged between 1950 and 1980, and logging and salvage practices of the time were not designed to protect streams or fisheries resources. As a result, many of the streams in the area have reduced fish access, poor water quality and altered hydrological function. The Kennedy Watershed Restoration Project (KWRP) was initiated in 1994 under the federal Canadian Salmon Enhancement and Restoration Fund, and since that time, local restoration crews have worked to restore the hydrological, biological, riparian, and ecological functions of the Kennedy Flats Watershed. Methods used have included removal of non-embedded small woody debris (SWD), anchoring of large woody debris (LWD) into functional structures, spawning gravel placement, riparian restoration, landslide restoration and road deactivation. Annual monitoring activities and qualitative assessments since the project’s inception have shown a marked improvement in stream ecology, enhanced fish habitat and healthier stands of riparian forest.Deforestation, Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry According to a Watershed Data Base report published by Brown et al. in 1987, approximately 42% of the Kennedy Flats Watershed (including areas now located within the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve) was logged between 1950 and 1980. As a result of primary logging activities, large amounts of both small and large woody debris (LWD) were left in-stream, and subsequent salvage logging for shake and shingle resulted in substantial deposition of additional small woody debris (SWD). This SWD, together with large downed logs spanning the width of the stream and collapsed culverts and bridges from decaying logging roads, created debris jams that restrict water flow, reduce scouring action, and diminish overall water quality (Warttig et al., 2001).
Fish habitat has been severely degraded as a result of the altered flow regime, as higher water levels and lower water velocity have failed to keep spawning beds clean of organic sediment, thereby reducing the number of quality spawning sites. Furthermore, natural recruitment of large woody debris (LWD) has been disrupted along lengthy sections of stream, resulting in an imbalance in the natural frequency of pools and riffles. At low flow, fish passage is impeded in some locations by wood debris or deteriorated culverts, and at high flows, fish move out of the creek system to inundated areas of the floodplain only to become stranded upon flow recession.
In addition to precipitating a decline in fish populations, the altered hydrological function of the streams on the Kennedy Flats has also had a negative impact on the surrounding forests. Woody debris areas act as semi-permeable dams and flood large tracts of surrounding riparian forest, and in many cases, the prevailing high water level has favored fast-growing wetland shrub and tree species (Salix and Alnus spp.) over regenerating conifers. These deciduous trees are neither as large nor as long-lived as mature conifers, and they do not provide the same level of bank protection or large woody debris recruitment that would occur in a fully functional riparian forest. Kennedy Flats is characterized by broad floodplains and meandering stream channels. Rolling to moderately steep hills and bedrock knobs, trending roughly northwest across the area, interrupt the generally flat topography. While total relief is approximately 250m in the Kootowis Creek and Staghorn Creek areas, the Lostshoe Creek Watershed has a significant up-slope portion, rising sharply to more than 700m. It straddles the Estevan Coastal Plain and the Vancouver Island Ranges portions of the Insular Mountains physiographic region (Holland 1964).
The bedrock geology in the Kennedy Flats area is composed of pre-Cretaceous sedimentary and volcanic rock. Periods of glacial activity are seen in compact basil tills, and periods of active alluvial deposition are evidenced by the sand and gravel deposits which act as aquifers. This complex history has resulted in the upper Lostshoe Creek area being inherently unstable (Polster 1998).
The type of forest ecology that is characteristic of the Long Beach Unit is late seral (>300 years) coastal temperate rainforest composed primarily of cedar and hemlock and associated plant communities. Assuming that native species and biological communities have adapted to this forest structure, the characteristics of late seral forest ecology (i.e. its stream and terrestrial components) would form a benchmark for measuring Kennedy Flats restoration trends. The objectives of the project are to restore the hydrological, biological, riparian and ecological functions of the Kennedy Flats Watershed.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The success of the Kennedy Flats Watershed restoration has depended to a large degree on support from the following contributing partners: Ahousaht First Nations; Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District; BC Access Centre; BC Parks; Central Westcoast Forest Society; Department of Fisheries and Oceans; District of Tofino; District of Ucluelet; DR Clough Consulting Ltd.; Eco-Action 2000; Fisheries Renewal BC; Forest Renewal BC; Hesquiat First Nations; Interfor; IWA Canada; Looker Industries; MacMillan Bloedel; Minister of Environment, Lands & Parks; Ministry of Forests; Northwest Ecosystem Institute; Pacific Salmon Foundation; Pacific Rim National Park; Steelhead Society, Habitat Restoration Corp.; Thornton Creek Salmon Enhancement Society; Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations; Tofino Salmon Enhancement Society; Toquaht First Nations; Ucluelet First Nations; Weyerhaeuser; and Wickaninnish Inn, Point Restaurant.
Government approval of activities undertaken in association with the project was obtained under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, Canadian Fisheries Act and the British Columbia Water Act. For work on provincial crown land, permits were required under Section 9 of the Water Act and Section 52 of the Forest Act (BC Ministry of Forests), and approvals were sought from individual tenure holders and the Central Region Board (CRB) or local First Nations.

Description of Project Activities: Level 1 and level 2 habitat inventories were conducted on the watersheds in 1995 and 1996 (Clough et al), and a detailed watershed restoration plan was completed in 2001 (Warttig et al. 2001).

Restoration is generally following a top-down approach, meaning that restoration begins in upslope areas, and proceeds downstream. Sediment input from the surrounding hillsides must first be stabilized. This is accomplished via logging road deactivation and slide stabilization utilizing revegetation and soil bioengineering techniques. In-stream restoration begins only after upslope problems have been addressed, and consists of four phases: removal of SWD and reorientation of LWD to improve cover, scour, bank protection and hydrologic function; maintenance, monitoring and addition of LWD in deficient areas; addition of spawning gravel in deficient areas; and riparian restoration.  

Non-embedded SWD is removed from the creeks, while any debris embedded in the creek bed is left in place to minimize the release of trapped sediment and hydrogen sulfide gas. Removed SWD is piled above the high water mark, ensuring that it will not return to the system during high flows. In areas with especially low banks (e.g., Lost Shoe Creek- Reach LS4 and KR2 in the Kootowis Creek Watershed), higher areas are brushed using chain saws, and the SWD is double tossed into these clearings. These debris piles can provide valuable cover and feeding habitat for wildlife, including birds, mammals, amphibians and invertebrates. Once most SWD is removed from the system, the remaining LWD (and often wood adjacent to the creek) is repositioned to improve creek scour and cover.

LWD structures installed during the 2007 project included: A-frame spurs, bundles and cover logs. Each LWD spur was built of a mixture of 6-12 m long logs and root-wads 2-3 m in diameter. The logs, root-wads, and rocks were transported approx 500m from the parking lot to the river bed by a Bell 407 helicopter (max. safe lifting capacity of approx 2400lbs) and arranged in roughly their final positions in the stream or along the bank.

LWD was re-oriented where necessary using peaveys, pike poles, turfers, and chainsaw winches; and then cabled into place using galvanized steel cable (5/8"" in diameter). Ballast rocks and standing dead trees and stumps were used as anchors. Where no other options existed, live trees were used as anchors.

In-stream structures are to be monitored annually for three years after installation, and once every five years after that (Warttig et al., 2001). Charts (called GANT charts) are used to document evaluation of the effectiveness of in-stream structures and to note any changes or problems that may have occurred during the winter floods. Using the methods outlined in Koning et al. (1997), each in-stream structure is assessed for specific physical and biological attributes and given an overall rating for condition, stability and function.

Spawning gravel placement was conducted in accordance with the guidelines in the spawning gravel SOP developed by program biologists in conjunction with Fisheries and Oceans Canada staff. Kootowis, Staghorn, and Salmon Creek sites were chosen based on accessibility, site conditions, and fish species present. The sites chosen in 2007 lacked natural gravel, were located at road crossings, and had been restored 2-3 years earlier. This lag between in-stream work and spawning gravel placement allows time for improved water flow to scour out accumulated organics and fines, and create a clean bed for gravel placement. The size and mixture of rock chosen for the sites is based on creek gradient, flow rates, observation of native gravel, and species utilization. A suitable mixture provides aeration and habitat while stabilizing the substrate. Prior to placement the rock mixture is washed and cleaned of fine sediments before it is transported by truck to each site. An excavator was used to deposit the spawning gravel in the creek, as the reach of an excavator allows for a wide disbursement of gravel. 

The riparian restoration phase generally consists of silvicultural treatments to accelerate old growth characteristics. Treatments are planned to enhance the development of old-growth attributes in the stand--e.g. by creating snags and gaps to enhance structural diversity--and may be carried out concurrently with in-stream restoration. This restoration approach is described in more detail in the Kennedy Watershed Restoration Plan, which can be downloaded from the CWFS website at www.clayoquot.org. 

Riparian silviculture treatments for Lost Shoe Creek (LS1) were recommended in an assessment carried out in 2001 (Poulin and Simmons, 2001). 1500 Sitka spruce and western red cedar trees were planted in prepared sites in clusters of 6 to 8 trees from Station 0+000 m to 0+737 m. Site preparation included thinning or felling of the over-mature red alder trees to create gaps of approximately 1-2 tree lengths. The largest diameter alder with good branching and live crowns were retained for overstory retention and biodiversity. Individual planting sites were prepared by brushing an area 4 by 5 m in size and removing competing salmonberry roots by hand. Although labour intensive, this process ensured the site would remain relatively brush free for up to two growing seasons. Cedar saplings were staked and coned to ensure protection from foraging deer, and the trees will remain coned for up to four growing seasons. Trees were planted in stumps and nurse logs and on steep slopes and along stream banks to mimic patterns of natural regeneration.

Riparian restoration is a key component of stream restoration because it ensures the future source of naturally occurring LWD. The lifespan of the constructed LWD structures is only estimated at 40 - 80 years, at which time natural recruitment must be sufficient to replace the failing structures. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Since the beginning of the Kennedy Watershed Restoration Project in 1994, approximately 70 km of stream habitat have been fully restored in the Kennedy Watershed. In addition, 62.5 ha of riparian forest have been restored, 48 ha of slide area have been bioengineered, and 247 km of logging road have been deactivated. As stream restoration progresses, qualitative monitoring seems to indicate improvement in overall stream conditions, health of the riparian forests and ecosystem integrity. Future funding will support a more comprehensive monitoring program that could help to better quantify the effects of restoration efforts.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The local community has benefited from the employment and training provided by the project, and strong partnerships have been encouraged between various community and stakeholder groups.
This project provides an example of the type of large-scale planning and long-term commitment that is necessary to effectively restore damaged watersheds and promote positive local stewardship values. Using workers from the local community and including local organizations as partners in the project has fostered a strong sense of accomplishment and ownership of the project among all involved. Pacific Rim National Park Reserve geographic information systems technicians completed a detailed survey and digital map of lower Lost Shoe Creek, from Station 0+549 m to 0+737 m, the location of the 2007 in-stream structures. This survey is the baseline from which future surveys can assess the physical changes that result from the construction of the 10 structures.
Monitoring and maintenance work should continue on all previously treated stream reaches in the Kennedy Flats Watershed. Brush levels should be monitored where conifers were planted in 2007 and brushed when needed. Downstream buildup of SWD will occur as the in-stream structures constructed in 2007 scour the creek releasing embedded SWD. Ongoing maintenance will therefore be necessary. There is also continued need for spawning gravel placement and monitoring, as lack of spawning gravel is a key limiting factor for salmonid populations in many of the streams in the watershed (Clough, 1995; Warttig et al., 2001). Although close to 70 km of stream length have been restored since the start of the Kennedy Flats Restoration Project, there remain many high priority stream reaches that have yet to be restored. Thus, further second-growth riparian restoration activities, culvert replacements, and road deactivations are required. An initial assessment completed on the lower section of the East river in the Twin Rivers sub-basin showed that several debris jams are present with reasonably good access, making this area a good candidate for continued restoration activities if suitable funding can be obtained.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/norway-restoration-of-calluna-heathlands/	Norway: Restoration of Calluna Heathlands	Norway	1997-01-01	2004-12-31	"The coastal heathlands of north-western Europe are endangered habitats of great conservation value. Invasion by the bracken Pteridium aquilinum is a major challenge for conservation and restoration of these heathlands, especially in the under-studied northern regions. Today, the herbicide asulam is the most widely applied bracken control measure, but increasing focus on organic farming and nature conservation calls for alternative, preferably mechanical, approaches. In a 7-year replicated restoration effort in western Norway, project researchers investigated efï¬ciencies of the four bracken control measures asulam, Gratil, annual cutting and biannual cutting, for restoring the characteristic heathland vegetation structure and species composition. The project speciï¬cally tested herbicide effects on diversity and composition of non-target species. Effects of treatments over time were evaluated by repeated measures ANOVA, and for multivariate data, Principal Response Curves. Project results show that UK-based control methods are largely applicable to bracken at its northern limit in the European heathland habitat. Asulam resulted in the fastest reduction in cover but cutting proved equally efficient over the long-term. Community compositions progressed toward desired heathland vegetation, but successional trajectories differed. Asulam had unintended effects on a number of heathland species not predictable by species characteristics or functional groups. Gratil failed to have any long-term effects. Overall, cutting is as efficient as herbicide application in reducing bracken, and more so in restoring northern heathland vegetation over time.Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Other The heathlands are man-made cyclic vegetation systems where secondary succession is manipulated by management, and major threats are abandonment leading to woodland encroachment, development leading to fragmentation, pollution and subsequent loss of diversity and invasion of species such as bracken. The spread of bracken is recognized as a serious threat to the unique qualities of heathlands as it eliminates characteristic ericoid shrubs, graminoids and forbs by the changing successional dynamics of these semi-natural systems, yielding habitats of low conservation, agricultural and recreational value. Bracken is the most widely distributed Pteridophyte on earth and the only terrestrial fern to dominate large areas outside woodlands in temperate climates. Once bracken is established, slowly-decaying litter and potentially toxic compounds may inhibit seed germination, establishment and growth of many characteristic heathland species, including Calluna vulgaris. Changes in climate and land use may favor the spread of bracken. Bracken has increased and by 2004 it had invaded about 30% of the area. The project was carried out in two adjacent areas: A, invaded by bracken and B, no bracken present. In both areas, ericoid shrub species such as C. vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea occurred throughout, in combination with common graminoids, forbs and mosses. The island is dominated by Calluna/grass heaths with mires/Salix shrubs in wetter areas. Parts of the semi-natural rangelands have been under semi-natural rangeland have been under continuous management (burning, grazing, and turf and heather cutting) up until today, creating a mosaic heathland of different successional stages. The area is grazed by .1 cow/ha in summer and by .8 sheep/ha in winter, which is comparable to stocking levels in other heathland areas. This project sought to compare the efficiency of different mechanical and herbicide bracken control practices. Our main focus is restoration of the heathland community and potential impacts of herbicides on the species composition and diversity. The project sought answers to several questions: 1) How effective are treatments in reducing bracken? 2) How successful are these different control measures in restoring heathland structure and community composition? 3) Do the herbicides affect structure, diversity, or composition of the non-target community?

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The lowland heathlands of Europe are endangered habitats of considerable value and are now protected under the EU Habitats directive. Norway has the northern one-third of Europe’s coastal heathlands, which are characterized by long and unbroken histories of management through burning and year-round grazing by sheep of the Old Norse breed. In contrast to their European Union counterparts, which are protected under the Habitats Directive, these northern heathland habitats lack national legislative instruments to ensure their conservation. Bracken is absent from the northernmost heathlands, but it is expanding. Bracken benefits from the reduction of extensive livestock grazing as well as from recent increases in airborne nitrogen deposition and use of artificial fertilizers. Traditionally, bracken was kept in check by grazing and cutting, and fronds used as bedding for livestock. Past practices have shown that biannual cutting is an efficient control measure, but since the 1960s herbicides have been widely used, particularly asulam (which is now the most commonly used herbicide for controlling bracken in Europe). With the rise of organics throughout Europe, all such chemically-based practices have come under increasing scrutiny for their effects.

Description of Project Activities: Experimental square plots of 25 sq m were established in two areas: A, invaded by bracken and B, no bracken present. The latter area was included to enable us to test for herbicide effects on the heathland community, independent of the effect of removing bracken. Plots were placed at least 10 m apart, creating a buffer zone to avoid effects of airborne herbicides. Three 0.5 m x 0.5 m permanent quadrats were randomly placed within each plot. In mid June of year T0 quadrates were analysed for % cover of all species of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens, functional groups (graminoids, forbs, ericoid shrubs and mosses), and environmental parameters (topography, slope, and aspect). Treatments applications were started in T0 and the quadrats were reanalyzed yearly in July/August of T1 - T6. Treatments were randomly allocated to plots within each area. The experimental design was expanded successively over the ï¬rst three years, yielding a balanced design of four replicate plots by ï¬ve treatments in area A and four replicate plots by three treatments in area B. In all cutting treatments bracken stems were cut app. 20 - 30 cm above ground, not affecting the non-target vegetation, and newly cut bracken fronds removed. After initial testing of different cutting techniques (motorised vs. scythes) a long handled scythe was selected as the most efï¬cient tool for our area. In area A, follow-up cutting of emerging bracken fronds in the chemically-treated plots was performed yearly in late July following the methods of Lowday and Marrs. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Results of the project showed that all treatments reduced bracken signiï¬cantly during the course of the test period, but that the response rates differed considerably. Biannual cuttings or spraying with asulam followed by annual cutting were the most effective means of reducing bracken cover long-term, conï¬rming that previously reported high efï¬ciency of these measures holds true for northern heathlands. Yearly cutting took longer to take effect, as one might expect, but once it did it was as effective as cutting biannually. As asulam is not legal in Norway, and as Gratil has been recommended as an alternative to asulam based on one short-term (2-year) experiment, it was of interest to include Gratil into the experimental protocol. In doing so, the project highlighted the importance of long-term monitoring in researching vegetational change, as called for by Stewart et al. (2005). However, the results showed Gratil sprayed bracken to regain dense cover the third year after treatment and can not be recommended as a bracken control tool. This recovery, in spite of follow-up cutting, is difï¬cult to explain and should be addressed in further investigations. All bracken control treatments affected species composition,  inducing a shift towards more open and species-rich communities dominated by ericoid shrubs, graminoids, and forbs. Research found more species beneï¬ting from the removal of bracken than suffering from the treatments, such as Hypericum pulchrum, C. pilulifera, V. ofï¬cinalis, Conopodium majus, L. corniculatus, Festuca vivipara and Vaccinium vitis-idaea. Some previous attempts at restoring Calluna heathlands by bracken control in the UK have resulted in grass-dominated communities, and simply controlling bracken by herbicides may not result in conservation or restoration of Calluna heathlands.This seems not to be the case at our site. The grazing regime at the site (sheep and cattle) is one possible explanation as Williams (1980) found bracken regrowth after asulam application to be considerably slowed by grazing sheep and cattle compared to sites grazed by sheep alone. Hence, trampling by cattle can be an important factor in bracken control, at least in areas where bracken stands are not too dense. The use of follow-up annual cutting treatments may also have increased the rate of success in re-establishing desirable heathland vegetation. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: In the bracken-dominated area the majority of non-target species were positively affected by asulam, suggesting the herbicide to have little detrimental effect on biodiversity. However, this effect confounds two causal factors: the herbicide per se and its effect through the removal of bracken fronds. Treatments in the area lacking bracken were included in the experimental setup to tease apart these two effects. Here, a majority of species were negatively affected, suggesting asulam to have negative effects on the biodiversity of non-target communities. A dense cover of bracken fronds will act as an umbrella, somewhat protecting the underlying vegetation from the full effects of the chemicals. However, the topography, vegetation cover and bracken density of northern heaths are very heterogeneous and herbicide application will unavoidably result in non-target species being sprayed directly. This calls for caution in herbicide application in heterogeneous heathlands, as found in northern regions, where non-target communities are intermingled with bracken-invaded heath. The negatively affected species belonged to different taxonomic and functional groups, and include the graminoids A. capillaris, Anthoxanthum odoratum, J. squarrosus and H. lanatus, the forbs V. ofï¬cinalis, G. saxatile, L. corniculatus, V. palustris, T. europaea and P. erecta, the ericaceous dwarf-shrub V. myrtillus, and the mosses H. splendens and Psuedoscleropodium purum. A number of additional species showed negative trends but occurred too sparsely to prove statistical signiï¬cance. V. myrtillus and P. purum were negatively affected in both areas and might be particularly sensitive to asulam. Other species found to be asulam sensitive are Digitalis purpurea, Prunella vulgaris, Lychnis ï¬‚os-cuculi and Centaurea nigra. A particularly interesting group of species are those unaffected or showing a positive response in area A, yet negatively affected in area B, such as V. ofï¬cinalis and L. corniculatus. This apparent shift can be accounted for by the ""˜dual effect' of asulam in the bracken-dominated area where the positive effect of its removal cancels out the negative effect of the herbicide per se. By including this ""˜double control-method' in the experimental setup, researchers were able to identify this group of bracken-suppressed, yet herbicide-sensitive species. Such species may be particularly difï¬cult to restore by chemical control, especially if repeated spraying is part of the protocol. This project was carried out on a small scale in vegetation dominated by common species. Species negatively affected by the herbicides belonged to different taxonomic and functional groups, making generalizations of potential responses of other (groups of) species very difï¬cult and need further investigation. In particular, many ferns are sensitive to asulam, and particular care should be taken in areas with a diverse and/or threatened fern ï¬‚ora.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: As most studies of herbicides are conducted in the ï¬elds of agriculture, forestry or by the manufacturers, they yield little information on the effects of these herbicides on semi-natural vegetation for conservation or restoration purposes. While much is known about the effects on target species, there is less information regarding their effects on non-target vegetation dynamics and on endangered or vulnerable non-target species likely to be found in heathlands. For successful conservation management these effects should be of most important consideration. For organic farming, which preclude the use of chemical control, alternative control methods need to be formulated. Our work shows that biannual cutting retards regrowth sufï¬ciently for effective control. Annual cutting was nearly as efï¬cient as biannual cutting after ï¬ve years, and may be a more economic option long-term. It is not possible to eradicate the species permanently, as other researchers did not succeed in this even after 18 years of continued bracken control, but the population can be kept at a level acceptable for keeping grazing livestock and conserving the threatened habitat of coastal heathlands. All bracken control measures were more efï¬cient in reducing bracken cover and had longer-lasting effects in this study compared to studies further south in Europe. This could be due to climatic and environmental constraints at the northern brink of bracken's distribution in the heathland habitat, suggesting that bracken control may be easier and less labour intensive here. On the other hand, bracken shows strong plastic responses to yearly climate variability. In northern areas, where temperature is the main limiting factor for growth, future increases in temperature and growing season duration could imply range expansion,  increasing rates of bracken invasions and denser bracken stands in already-invaded areas. Future climate change could therefore result in a greater need for bracken control measures in the management of northern heathlands.
Overall the project noted that selection of bracken control measures for heathland conservation, restoration or management needs to take into account regional location and topography, the desirable future vegetation after control as well as any special needs of particular land-uses such as organic farming, habitat conservation or conservation of rare/endangered species. Mechanical control can be relatively efï¬cient, especially in northern areas when combined with grazing. These are important issues as it is likely that the use of bracken control measures will have to increase if the heathlands of Northern Europe are to be conserved for the future. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-nevada-restoration-of-riparian-wet-meadows/	USA: Nevada: Restoration of Riparian Wet Meadows	United States of America	1996-01-01	1998-12-31	"The goal of this project was to restore riparian grass and sedge meadows currently dominated by Artemisia tridentata var. tridentata. The project sought to evaluate burning sites with low, intermediate, and high water tables; essentially, dry, intermediate, and wet sites. In order to define the alternative states and thresholds for these ecosystems, the project examined burning and water table effects on both abiotic variables and the establishment of grasses adapted to relatively high (Poa secunda ssp. juncifolia), intermediate (Leymus triticoides), or low (L. cinereus) water tables. Wet sites had lower soil temperatures and higher soil water contents than dry sites. Burning was found to increase soil temperatures on all sites. Undershrub microsites on control plots had the lowest temperatures, while former undershrub microsites on burn plots had the highest temperatures. Surface soil water was low on burn plots early in the growing season due to desiccation, but higher at deeper depths after active plant growth began. Emergence was generally greater on wet sites, but survival was microsite- and species-specific. Undershrub microsites on control plots facilitated emergence and first-year survival, but seedlings that survived initially harsh conditions on burn plots had similar numbers alive at the end. In general, favorable environments and establishment of species adapted to mesic conditions indicate that wet sites are an alterative state of the naturally occurring dry meadow ecosystem type, and can be restored to grass and sedge meadows. Harsh environments and lack of species establishment adapted to mesic conditions indicate that dry sites have crossed a threshold and may represent a new ecosystem type. Understory vegetation and seed banks on dry sites have been depleted, and restoration will require burning and reseeding with species adapted to more xeric conditions.Agriculture & Livestock, Climate Change, Fragmentation Riparian corridors in the western US are severely degraded due to overgrazing by livestock, stream channel incision, and lowered water tables. One consequence of this initial degredation is the expansion and dominance of the shrub Artemisia tridentata var. tridentata, and the loss of what were once grass and sedge dominated meadows. This ecosystem is semi-arid, temperate, and continental. Sites are nearly level to gently sloping with multiple aspects. These sites are a combination of intermittently flooded sites, such as arroyos, playas, and dry washes to intermittent streams. Soils are moderately deep silts and clays with an often shallow water table. The herbaceous layer varies from Poa secunda to Leymus spp., with a wide range of associated herbaceous and graminoid species. There is often a moderate cover of perennial forbs, but rather they are scattered throughout such stands. Flooding of these ecosystems is intermittent and unpredictable. Many of these types of ecosystems are particularly sensitive to grazing. The project addressed three questions: 1) How do soil water and temperature differ among water tables and in response to burning, and what are the effects of Artemisia?, 2) How is the establishment of plant species adapted to relatively high, intermediate, and low water tables affected by water table depth, burning, and Artemisia?, 3) Can the abiotic and establishment responses be used to identify alternative states and define restoration thresholds for these ecosystems?

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Riparian meadows increase water storage, decrease sedimentation, and provide forage for both wildlife and livestock, their restoration is of considerable interest to land managers. The research was conducted on the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, the largest national forest outside of Alaska, a 6.3 million acre forest stretching from California across northern Nevada.

Description of Project Activities: Five Artemisia-dominated study sites were located within the Toiyabe Mountains in central Nevada in July 1996, representing a gradient of modification of the dry meadow ecosystem type.  Selection was based on presence of species typical of the dry meadow and Artemisia/Leymus ecosystem types. The depth to the water table was determined from hand-augered wells. The project included two replicate high water table sites (water was at -153 to -267 cm), one intermediate water table site (-250 cm to -280 cm), and two low water table sites (greater than 300 cm). The wet and intermediate sites had higher cover of perennial graminoids and forbs, lower densities and volumes of Artemisia, and were more similar to the model dry meadow type than low water table sites. Common species included Carex douglassii, L. cinereus, L. triticoides, Poa secunda ssp. juncifolia, and Lupinus argenteus. A paired plot approach was used in which one plot at each site received the restoration treatment and the other served as a control (referred to as burn and control plots, respectively). Plots (740 sq m to 900 sq m) were fenced following treatment to exclude livestock and native ungulates. Treated plots were burned from the 19th to the 21st of October 1996 using a drip-torch to remove both woody and understory vegetation. All Artemisia was killed as a result of the burn.  Rain gauges were located at each site to record growing season precipitation. Water table depth was measured monthly throughout the growing season in burn and control plots at each site with three or four wells installed in September 1996. Seedling establishment was examined for those grass species adapted to relatively wet, dry, and intermediate site conditions (Poa secunda ssp. juncifolia, Leymus cinereus, and L. triticoides, respectively) on both burn and control plots. Seeds of Poa were collected near the study sites in the summer prior to the burn. Seed fill was low and commercial seed was used for other species. Establishment quadrats (50 cm x 50 cm) were randomly located in both past and present undershrub and interspace microsites in burn and control plots. Quadrats were seeded in October 1996 following the burn with 100 filled seeds (1997 cohort) using a 50 cm x 50 cm grid with 100 evenly spaced holes. The small Poa seeds were placed 1 cm below the surface, while larger seeds of the two Leymus species placed 2 cm below the surface. Seeding was repeated one year later in October 1997 with four new locations using identical methods (1998 cohort). Seedling emergence and survival was censused every three weeks in 1997 and 1998 starting in April or May and continuing through July.  During the summer dry period (Aug-Sept) survival was monitored monthly.  Root sprouts and seelings of species that were not seeded were removed at each sampling date to reduce competition. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Both water table depths and pre-treatment vegetation indicated that Artemisia dominated sites within these riparian corridors are generally at the lower end of the water table depths required to support the dry meadow ecosystem type. Weixelman et al. (1996) described the dry meadow ecological type in this region as having depths to saturation of-70 to -100 cm in June and July. Depth to water table reached these levels only in the spring and early summer of 1998 on the wet and intermediate sites. The relatively low water tables on the study sites are reflected in the persistence of Artemisia and rabbitbrush which cannot survive on sites that have high water tables or periods of prolonged soil saturation in the spring. For the water tables examined in this project, wet sites generally had more favorable environmental conditions (higher soil water and lower soil temperatures) than the dry sites. Soils on wet sites had lower percentages of coarse fragments (12% for the wet sites vs. 23% on the dry sites) and higher organic carbon than soils on dry sites. Coarser soils and lower organic carbon on dry sites undoubtedly resulted in lower water retention and capillary movement. Also, dry sites had higher Artemisia densities and volumes, but lower abundances of perennials in the understory than wet sites. In dry years, perennial understory species on wet sites may effectively deplete soil water in near surface soils relatively early in the growing season. Higher Artemisia densities coupled with lower soil water retention and water tables on dry sites may contribute to generally lower water contents throughout the soil profile. Burning had no measurable influence on water table depths on the small plots, but had significant effects on soil temperature and water. Generally higher soil temperatures following the burn was a function of eliminating the shade provided by burned vegetation, removing the insulating effect of litter, and altering the soil albedo. Initially lower soil water in surface soils was the result of snow removal, desiccation by wind, and increased soil temperatures resulting in higher evaporation. The increase in soil water at depths > 30 cm was probably a result of removing the deeper-rooted Artemisia. In areas sprayed with 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) to remove Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana, soil water depletion during the growing season was reduced an average of 9% or 2.4 cm annually over a 20-yr period. Most of the difference occurred at deeper depths (- 0.9 to - 1.8 m), and the greatest difference (+33%) occurred the year after spraying when herbaceous biomass was low. Artemisia plants influenced soil temperature and water on control plots and had residual effects on burned plots. Reduced solar radiation coupled with higher humidity under Artemisia canopies explain the lower soil temperatures in undershrub microsites. Higher burn temperatures under shrubs and mortality of existing vegetation may explain both higher soil temperatures and soil water in burn undershrub microsites. Fire in under canopy locations is often hot enough to burn existing vegetation and litter, and result in darker and warmer soils. The abiotic conditions on the different sites had significant effects on seedling establishment. 
Like other semi-arid ecosystems, generally higher emergence and life spans on wet and intermediate sites can be related to higher soil water retention and availability. Higher vegetative regrowth, greater snow retention, and less extreme fluctuations in soil temperatures on wet and intermediate sites were probably also important. These results indicate that wet sites have the potential to support episodic establishment of species requiring mesic conditions, and to provide these species with adequate water once rooted. Burn plots generally had lower emergence than control plots, except during the second year on wet sites. Near surface soils on burn plots had lower soil water availability and higher but more variable soil temperatures, and the combined soil temperature and water requirements for germination may not have been met. Also, mortality of seedlings that did emergence was probably high. Seedlings that survived the initially harsh conditions on burn plots exhibited relatively high life spans and greater growth (although not measured). The increase in soil water after Artemisia removal is greatest in the first year after treatment, and this increase undoubtedly facilitates vegetative regrowth and seedling establishment. Individual Artemisia plants affected seedling establishment both before and after the burn. In semi-arid ecosystems, facilitation of seedling establishment by shrubs that modify the environment can depend upon the degree of stress resource levels and environmental conditions) experienced by seedlings. In this study, emergence was ighest in control undershrub microsites when other microsites had lower soil water availability or more extreme temperatures, e.g., spring and early summer 1997. Similarly, survival was highest in undershrub microsites when soil water availability was relatively high, e.g., 1998 when surface soil water rapidly declined. The interaction between seedling and shrub usually switches from facilitation to competition once the life stage changes from seedling to adult. In this study, seedlings in undershrub microsites were typically smaller than in other microsites. After the burn, harsher environmental conditions resulted in lower seedling emergence. But, lack of competition from Artemisia and herbaceous species resulted in life spans and numbers of surviving individuals that were similar to other microsites.  Species differences in emergence and survival can be related to their affinities to sites with different water tables. Poa occurs with high constancy in the dry meadow ecosystem type and requires the highest water tables. It had almost no emergence in 1997, the dry year, but moderate emergence in 1998, the wet year. The species with intermediate water table requirements, L. triticoides, consistently had the highest emergence and survival on wet and intermediate sites. L. cinereus had the highest survival and life spans of the three species in the drier 1997, and it had the highest life spans on dry sites in 1998. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The abiotic and establishment responses can be used to identify alternative states and define restoration thresholds for Artemisia-dominated riparian corridors. Water table depths and shrub abundance indicated that the study sites were at the lower end of the water tables necessary to support dry meadow ecosystems. Despite this, wet sites had both higher soil water contents and lower soil temperatures than dry sites. Seedling emergence was higher on wet sites for all three species, and survival of species adapted to high and intermediate water tables, Poa and L. triticoides, was generally highest on wet sites followed by the intermediate site. In contrast, survival of the species adapted to more xeric conditions, L. cinereus, was clearly higher on dry sites. These results indicate that wet and intermediate sites represent an alternative state of the dry meadow ecosystem type, and have the potential to be restored to grass and sedge dominance. Due to relatively low water tables on these sites, maintaining grass and sedge dominance probably requires proper grazing and possibly periodic burning. Dry sites appear to have crossed a threshold as reflected by a lack of environmental conditions necessary for establishment of species adapted to dry meadows. They may represent a new site type with the potential to support the Artemisia/Leymus ecosystem type. The understory vegetation and seed banks on dry sites have been depleted, and restoration will require burning and reseeding with species adapted to more xeric conditions.

Two projects were conducted on contrasting sites to investigate cost-effective methods for the re-establishment of vegetation dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather), which is the usual target community seen as the desired replacement for Pteridium aquilinum (bracken) in the uplands by many land managers. At one site, where grazing intensity was low and shelter was sufficient to prevent rapid Pteridium litter loss, the necessary treatments to establish Calluna were to disturb the litter and add a source of Calluna seeds. A difference between continued Pteridium control or a relaxation of control was not observed over the time-scale of the experiment. At the second site, where grazing intensity was high and shelter minimal, vegetation dominated by Rumex acetosella had developed on a thin but dense litter layer. To enhance Calluna regeneration it was necessary to prevent sheep grazing, disturb the remaining litter layer and add a source of Calluna propagules. A nurse crop hindered Calluna establishment due to its vigorous growth. At neither site was an initial application of fertilizer an aid to Calluna establishment. It is possible to devise methods for the re-establishment of Calluna at sites where previous attempts at Pteridium control alone have not had the desired effect on vegetation development. However, the precise choice of methods used is dependent on the grazing management at the site. High levels of livestock grazing prevented Calluna establishment, but some trampling may aid litter breakdown. The ability to adjust stocking rates and access to the site by machinery are critical factors to take into account in producing an effective strategy for long-term Pteridium control and its replacement by target vegetation.Agriculture & Livestock In many parts of the world bracken has long been recognized as an agricultural weed. In Britain, the perception of Pteridium as a weed problem has resulted from its decline in use for agricultural, domestic, and industrial purposes, including animal bedding, thatching and soap and the apparent expansion of large areas of Pteridium into previously productive agricultural land. In is though to cover about 3700 sq km of the land surface of Great Britain, about 1.6% of the land area. Pteridium-dominated areas have little agricultural or conservation interest, except in a small number of cases, such as the occurrence of high brown and heath fritillary butterflies and their associated food plants. Pteridium is also known to invade other, more valued, plant communities including semi-natural grassland and heathland. This type of invasion is a far more potentially damaging, both for agricultural profitability, animal welfare, sporting interests and for conservation. It is difficult to assess the pre-disturbance condition of the ecosystem, as it has had considerable human influence for hundreds of years. There has been considerable grazing pressure at these sites, with a stocking rate at the Hordron Edge site of .5 sheep/ha, while the Wetherhouse Moor site was subjected to considerable grazing pressure as part of a large common. By the time of initiation of the project the uncompacted Pteridium litter that had been originally present had been lost and the surface was composed of highly compacted litter, rhizome fragments and soil. Initial sampling of the vegetation done in 1993 at the Hordron Edge site showed that Pteridium litter comprised 99.3% of the ground cover. A small number of Chamerion angusifolium, Deschampsia flexuosa and Galium saxatile were present, as were Betula spp. Pinus sylvestris and Sorbus aucuparia. Wetherhouse Moor was sampled in 1993 as well, litter at this site made up only 80% of ground cover. The three dominants at this site were Rumex acetosella, Campylopus introflexus, and Festuca ovina. The aim of this project was to develop strategis for directing succession where Pteridium control alone has not yielded results. This project was directed as restoring the vegetation dominated by Calluna, as this was the dominant species of the surrounding vegetation and the intended target of the land owner/manager at the time of the spraying.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
There have been many attempts to control Pteridium, with two accepted methods at present: cutting and the application of the herbicide, asulam). Long-term Pteridium control is not common, except where follow-up treatments have been applied and many experimental treatments show that recovery of the Pteridium is often complete within 10 years of spraying. Aerial spraying of asulam can be cost effective for Pteridium control, particularly if followed by necessary steps to keep it in a suppressed state. The typical reason for Pteridium control is to restore other vegetation, cognizant of the fact that after aerial spraying vegetation development is slow, patchy and unpredictable. In most instances, vegetation development is often slow and tied closely to litter breakdown, while in many situations the target community is some form of Calluna vulgaris-dominated vegetation. This project was the first attempt to develop cost-effective strategies for vegetaton restoration in the marginal upland areas where the majority of Pteridium control takes place.

Description of Project Activities: The effects of four treatments on the rate and composition of vegetation regeneration were investigated at the Hordron Edge site; (1) maintenance of Pteridium suppression, (2) litter disturbance, (3) addition of Calluna seed and (4) fertilizer addition . A split-plot design was chosen with continued Pteridium suppression or unhindered Pteridium regeneration forming the main plots. It was impractical to implement this treatment in a full factorial design, as light penetration from the side of small plots would have partly negated the shading effects of the Pteridium. Main plots were 9 m x 5 m. The other three treatments were implemented factorially in eight 1 m x 1 m subplots within each main plot. Subplots were separated from each other and the edge of the main plot by 1 m. Four, fully replicated, blocks were established in August 1993. Continued Pteridium suppression was carried out by a once-yearly cut, usually in early August. Litter disturbance was achieved by the removal of the litter layer with a rake which was carried out in October 1993. Calluna seed addition was achieved by adding 500 g of cut Calluna shoots per subplot (equivalent to 5 t/ha), again in October 1993. Fertilizer addition (150 kg/ha of ENMAG, a slow-release preparation) was carried out in April 1994, with the intention that it would benefit any recently germinated seedlings.

The effects of four treatments on vegetation succession were assessed at the Wetherhouse Moor site; (1) grazing management, (2) litter disturbance, (3) addition of Calluna seed and (4) fertilizer addition. An extra level was added to the seeding treatment by inclusion of a nurse crop to aid surface stabilization and Calluna establishment. A split plot design was chosen with grazing access or exclosure forming the main plots, as it was practical to fence only four areas. Main plots were 11 m x 9 m. The other three treatments were implemented factorially in 12 subplots (1 m x 1 m) within each main plot. Subplots were separated from each other by 1 m and the edge of the main plot by 2 m. Four fully replicated blocks were established in August 1993. Livestock-proof fences were erected in October 1993. Litter disturbance, addition of Calluna seed and fertilizer addition were all carried out in the same manner and at the same rates as at Hordron Edge. The nurse crop was a mixture of Agrostis castellana (20 kg/ha) and D. flexuosa (40 kg/ha) (Emorsgate Seeds, Tilney All Saints, Norfolk). The Pteridium on this site was prevented from regeneration by once yearly cutting or pulling. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The two project sites chosen were considered to be representative of many similar sites across Great Britain. The Hordron Edge site is typical of many where a deep litter layer accumulates and ground disturbance by herbivores is minimal. The Wetherhouse Moor site is typical of sites where exposure to wind and trampling by herbivores is sufficient to remove the thick litter layer, leaving a compacted mixture of soil, litter and rhizome material as the substrate. Each of the treatments employed in the experiment had an effect on the development of vegetation at both sites. However, it should be borne in mind that the target for restoration was a community dominated by Calluna vulgaris, and analysis of the benefits of treatment effects is discussed with this aim and the constraints against successful regeneration set out above in mind. Bracken regeneration, over the course of the experiment at Hordron Edge, did not appear to have affected the growth of established vegetation. However, in the long term, it is well known that bracken will eventually shade out almost all the established vegetation by the time it has fully recovered from treatment. The deep litter layer at Hordron Edge effectively prevented the establishment of almost all vegetation, particularly as much of the moss cover was growing over relatively intact litter. Seven years after the initial spraying, a vascular plant cover of only 5.5% had established in plots where litter disturbance had not taken place. Litter disturbance increased total vegetation cover and the cover of vascular plants, especially the cover of Agrostis capillaris and Calluna, presumably by exposing bare soil for germination. Until the litter layer breaks down, it would appear that vegetation establishment and growth on this site will remain slow. Litter disturbance alone at Wetherhouse Moor, where little litter was present at the start of the experiment, had much reduced effects on the dynamics of the vegetation. To establish any Calluna cover at Hordron Edge it was necessary to add seed to areas where the litter had been disturbed. Here it contributed ca. 50% of the established cover and established plants appeared to be healthy and capable of long-term survival. In order to achieve Calluna establishment at Wetherhouse Moor it was also necessary to add a source of seed. There was little evidence of Calluna establishment from the seed bank (probably minimal) or seed rain at either site, despite the close proximity of Calluna stands. Many stands of Pteridium appear to be of considerable age and hence have impoverished seed banks necessitating seed addition. Fertilizer addition had very little effect at either site except to increase the cover of D. flexuosa, which was a natural colonist at Hordron Edge and sown as the nurse crop at Wetherhouse Moor. In fact the addition of a D. flexuosa nurse crop to stabilize the soil surface at Wetherhouse Moor had a deleterious effect on the development of Calluna cover. It would appear that the sowing of such a nurse crop, while useful in extremely nutrient poor systems and where surface stability is a problem, such as on bare peat or mine wastes, appeared detrimental where these conditions do not apply. At Wetherhouse Moor, the different vegetation dynamics within and outside the exclosures demonstrated the importance of grazing to reach the target community. The developing Calluna appeared to require protection from grazing, but protection from grazing also allowed the expansion of competitors; D. flexuosa and bracken itself. The regeneration of bracken was considerably slowed where trampling occurred. Outside the exclosures the vegetation was very different with Campylopus introflexus and Rumex acetosella dominating. This pattern of vegetation change was similar to many observed in surveys of areas subject to bracken control. Bracken regeneration appeared to be reduced by high stock levels, and D. flexuosa was an early and successful colonist of bracken litter at low grazing pressures. However, D. flexuosa also flourished on some sites where grazing sufficiently disturbed the soil surface allowing the spread of this species. Campylopus introflexus and Rumex acetosella both appeared to benefit from either reduced competition outside the exclosures, or from the continued substantial levels of disturbance. The treatments used to overcome the constraints for restoration were imposed in a factorial design, and hence interactions between treatment will guide the choice of treatment combinations. At Hordron Edge (lightly grazed, deep litter site) disturbing the litter to provide germination niches and adding seed to exploit these niches was the most successful treatment combination for Calluna establishment. This would appear to be the most likely and cost-effective method to restore a Calluna-dominated community at similar sites as long as the bracken control was continued to prevent regeneration. At Wetherhouse Moor (more heavily grazed, open ground site) Calluna cover was maximized by excluding grazing, disturbing the remaining litter and adding Calluna seed. Bracken control must also be maintained to prevent further shading of plants where protection from grazing increases the recovery of bracken from control. The broad conclusions from this project are similar to those reached in a study of vegetation restoration after bracken control on lowland heathland as well as many other studies of heathland restoration. What is clear at both sites was that in order to achieve substantial Calluna establishment and growth, seed must be added. Where any litter layer is present, this must be removed in some way (rotovation, burning, raking off) to provide suitable soil conditions for germination and establishment. However, they show that there is little benefit in allowing natural colonization to take place (unlike on lowland heathland). Intervention is necessary to produce vegetation close to the desired target. In addition, the experiments described above demonstrate a number of other important points. A nurse crop appears to hinder successful establishment and early fertilizer addition does not promote Calluna growth. Also, the success of Calluna regeneration appears to be dependent on grazing pressure, as it is prevented at high grazing intensities (Wetherhouse Moor). It appeared to be unhindered by the light grazing at Hordron Edge. However, this simple comparison demonstrates that there is a need to carry out experiments at different stocking rates. Such investigations would identify an optimal range of grazing intensity where the impact on the Calluna regeneration would be minimal, whilst maximizing the grazing of competitors and the trampling of regenerating fronds and litter. Such trade-off may not exist, depending on the grazing preference of the livestock used, and more direct management may be necessary. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The results of this study indicate that a strategy for restoring Calluna-dominated vegetation appears to be possible. However, feasibility and affordability must also be considered. In order to carry out many of the treatments described, access by vehicle is essential. This is clearly not an option on many sites. Litter removal can be achieved by burning, but this involves the availability of enough labour to control the fire. Seed can be spread by hand, but again this may be difficult where large areas are involved. Stock control is often difficult to achieve, because of open access on common land, the high cost of fencing or the lost profit resulting from reducing stock numbers. Thus the successful implementation of a combined bracken control and vegetation restoration program has to have in place the necessary funding to ensure an effective outcome, whether that funding comes from the landowner or from an agri-environmental scheme.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/spain-restoration-of-quercus-pyrenaica-forestssouthern-spain/	Spain: Restoration of Quercus pyrenaica Forests,Southern Spain	Spain	1998-01-01	2003-12-31	"This project sought to understand the role of shrubs in the restoration of Quercus pyrenaica forests in southern Spain. The project was an effort to evaluated two treatments associated with the planting of one year old Quercus pyrenaica seedlings: (1) bare soil, using a 30-cm diameter auger bit (conventional technique) and (2) under the canopy of a pioneer shrub, Salvia lavandulifolia, using a 12-cm diameter auger bit. The project monitored survival and growth for six years. The project set out to establish that the use of shrubs as a nurse plant is an alternative technique for reforestation with higher success than traditional techniques, in which pre-existing vegetation has been considered a source of competition. The rationale for this project was that in environments with a dry season, pre-existing vegetation buffers summer drought stress, ameliorates the water status of seedlings and thus usually increases seedling recruitment. After six years the project found that Quercus survival was more than six times higher when planted under individuals of the pioneer shrubs when compared to open areas. Quercus seedlings under shrubs also had shoots 1.8 times longer, while the number of shoots per plant did not differ. While the summer dry season was the main cause of mortality, the use of shrubs as nurse plants for Q. pyrenaica reforestation is a viable technique to increase establishment success.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Mining & Resource Extraction Quercus pyrenaica (Melojo oak) is an abundant deciduous species of the western Mediterranean basin, extending through western France, the Iberian Peninsula and northern Morocco. Q. pyrenaica is a major tree in Mediterranean silviculture, which through historic human use and degradation accounts for the serious degradation of the forests seen today. Following disturbance in these ecosystems, they are often replaced by sclerophyllous Quercus species such as Q. ilex and Q. suber, which are better adapted to the poorer soils and drier conditions once the original forest has disappeared. Intensive human intervention is probably responsible for the complete replacement of Q. pyrenaica forests in present times, which is particularly relevant for populations that are locate along the southern boundary of the species distribution area, primarily found in southern Spain. Because of the excellent soil found beneath the canopy of Q. pyrenaica these areas which were cut over were often turned to agricultural uses immediately thereafter, with considerable livestock grazing as one agricultural use. The specific project site, however, has not been grazed since 1997 when the area was declared a National Park. Quercus pyrenaica forests occur mostly between 400 and 1600 m, rising above 1800 m in southerly locales, and require between 650 and 1200 mm annual precipitation. The species grows predominantly in siliceous soils, but forests are also found on calcareous soils in localities where precipitation is high enough to allow a soil pH to fall close to a neutral value. The species resprouts abundantly from a dense net of shallow roots, which allow rapid regeneration after disturbances and makes it a suitable tree species for copping and preventing erosion. Three specific goals and/or questions guided the project: 1) What is the effect of shrubs on survival and growth of reforested seedlings?, 2) Are the patterns of survival and growth coupled?, and 3) What is the most critical period fore the establishment of planted seedlings?

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The project itself was conceived because natural regeneration of Q. pyrenaica forests are constrained by several factors, particularly in its southern locations. First, the species reproduces mostly by resprouting and acorn production is low and scattered. Second, acorns, when available, suffer extremely high rates of predation by several vertebrates, reaching losses that prevent regeneration. In either case, acorns are highly predated even after sowing and so the most common procedure for reforestation is the planting of seedlings grown in nurseries. However, plantations of Q. pyrenaica suffer heavy losses, primarily from summer drought, that destroy restoration efforts. Such losses have been found to hold true for other species of Quercus and other reforested trees in the Mediterranean area, which are mostly caused by heavy mortality during the first growing season. The rationale for the study was that, for dry environments such as the Mediterranean, the presence of nurse shrubs may increase establishment success by reducing summer drought stress resulting in facilitation.

Description of Project Activities: One-year-old Q. pyrenaica seedlings were planted in March 1998 in two treatments (microhabitats): (1) Open: seedlings planted in areas of bare soil and (2) Salvia: seedlings planted under the canopy of Salvia lavandulifolia, which was used as a pioneer shrub. The technique used for planting in the Open microhabitat employed the usual procedure followed in the region, consisting of planting seedlings in open interspaces to avoid proximity to shrub species. The planting holes were dug 40 cm deep with a mechanical augur with a 30-cm diameter bit. This is the augur traditionally used in this type of reforestation in the region, as it provides the greatest hole without hampering its manipulation by workers due to excessive weight. After planting, the soil was manually worked in an area of 0.5 m2 around the plant to improve soil structure and increase water retention. For planting in the Salvia microhabitat, we used a smaller augur bit (12 cm diameter) to minimize damage to the shrub roots, and no further cultivation was done around the plants. Initial conditions for establishment and growth were thus poorer in the Salvia microhabitat due to the lower volume of loose soil and lack of further cultivation around the plants. In all cases, the soil was returned to the holes and firmed around the root collar of the seedling. The Salvia plants chosen as planting sites were between 20 and 35 cm high. No further work was done in the reforestation. Planting points were distributed ca. 200 m apart in three plots of ca. 6000 m2. In each plot, we planted 100 seedlings per microhabitat (600 experimental seedlings in total), sampling points being randomly assigned. All seedlings were tagged and mapped. At the end of June 1998, before the onset of summer drought, Quercus seedlings were examined, and those that had died due to transplant shock (2.6% of planted seedlings) were excluded from the experiment. Seedlings were purchased from a nursery located at 1600 m a.s.l. at Sierra Nevada (Soportújar, Granada), grown in plastic trays (18 cm deep, 4 cm side) filled with a substrate of native soil mixed with organic material. The mean length of the seedlings at planting was ca. 5 cm. The acorns came from local populations of Sierra Nevada National Park. The experiment was monitored until the sixth growing season. For each experimental seedling the following data was recorded: (1) Survival, which was sampled at the end of the growing season (October) in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2003; (2) Cause of mortality; (3) Length of the longest shoot, measured three (October 2000) and six (October 2003) years after planting; (4) Number of shoots, which was also sampled three and six years after planting. Survival was corrected through the years for those seedlings apparently dead but resprouting the following year (a common phenomenon in this and other  Quercus species), so that any resprouting seedling was considered alive. Resprouting of aerial biomass was not further recorded after the fourth growing season, and thus the final survival data analysed (six years after planting) can be considered free of spurious results due to resprouting. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Seedling survival differed among treatments. The survival percentage under Salvia was 34.8% after six years (all plots pooled), while in the Open microhabitat only 5.5% of seedlings were still alive. The survival rate differed among plots but in all cases followed the same among-microhabitat pattern, with seedlings planted under Salvia showing higher survival in all the plots (no plot â‹… microhabitat interaction). The highest mortality occurred during the first summer, when 49.1% of the initially established seedlings died. Summer drought was the main cause of mortality (99.2%), with very few seedlings dying from other causes (ungulate trampling and vole tunnels). The results from the project show that the survival of Q. pyrenaica seedlings was 6.3 â‹… higher under Salvia lavandulifolia than in the open microhabitat, despite the fact that the planting conditions were ostensibly more favourable for seedlings planted in the latter microhabitat. This huge difference gains further relevance when considering the percentage of surviving seedlings, as only 5.5% of those planted in the open microhabitat survived after six years in comparison to 34.8% under Salvia lavandulifolia. Furthermore, the patterns of growth and survival were coupled, the length of the leader shoot after six years being 1.8 â‹… higher under Salvia in comparison to open areas. The growth of the seedlings, although low, was in accordance with those reported for Q. pyrenaica even in more favourable areas of its range Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The first growing season was the most critical period for survival, accounting for approximately half of the deaths. In addition, the survival pattern across treatments was established during the first growing season, with the rank order of among-microhabitat survival rates remaining similar over consecutive years. This supports the contention that the first year is the most critical period for the establishment of reforested tree seedlings, and confirms the robustness of conclusions drawn from this six-year study. Thus, the results show on one hand that the restoration of these Q. pyrenaica forests was not possible in open interspaces, and on the other hand that it is necessary to employ a technique that ensures a high survival rate during the first growing season. The extremely low values of survival in the open microhabitat might be influenced by the fact that the year of sowing was relatively dry. This magnifies the relevance of shrubs as nurse plants, allowing survival even in relatively adverse years.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The mechanisms underlying facilitation in Mediterranean type ecosystems are related primarily to a reduction of radiation intensity during summer, which improves the water status of the seedlings through lowering of soil temperature and conserving soil moisture.  Experimental field studies indicate that the shade provided by the canopy of shrubs or artificial meshes is the main factor favouring the survival of Quercus seedlings planted in Mediterranean type ecosystems as well as other water stressed habitats. All this suggests that pioneer shrubs, such as Salvia, characterized by a short, open canopy that moderately reduces radiation during the first years after planting, may potentially ensure reforestation success. Salvia species, as well as other shrubby species with similar morphological characteristics, are common in degraded habitats of the Mediterranean mountains, and thus the use of this reforestation technique could be extensively employed for Q. pyrenaica reforestation. Other possible mechanisms, such as a nutritional improvement of soil under shrubs or a richer soil microbial and fungal communities cannot be ruled out, strengthening the role of shrubs as regeneration niches for planted seedlings. In fact, soil beneath Salvia lavandulifolia has a higher concentration of P and K than in open interspaces. In this sense, it is noticeable that mature Q. pyrenaica forests grow mostly on siliceous soils. The species is thus traditionally considered to require decarbonated soils, although it is also present in calcareous soils. Soil properties lose importance in vegetation dynamics with the maturation of the community, given the buffering effect of organic matter on bed rock characteristics. The use of shrubs could thus be particularly critical for the restoration of these forests on calcareous soils. Furthermore, shrubs may protect Q. pyrenaica seedlings from browsing and trampling of vertebrate herbivores. The facilitative effect of shrubs upon seedling establishment has been similarly reported for other Quercus species around the world in environments characterized by a severe moisture stress during the growing season. More particularly, in accordance with these results, this facilitative interaction has been consistently reported for Mediterranean type ecosystems, as for instance Q. douglasi, Q. lobata and Q. agrifolia in California, Q. ilex in southern Spain, or Q. humilis in grasslands of southern France. This suggests that the use of shrubs as nurse plants to boost reforestation success of the genus Quercus might be applicable to a wide range of sites, at least to those environments characterized by moisture stress during the growing season. In the case of Q. pyrenaica, our results clearly show that the use of shrubs as planting sites may help to recover these climax forests with the potential to cover vast areas of the western Mediterranean region.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/canada-point-pelee-national-park-restoration/	Canada: Point Pelee National Park Restoration	Canada	1960-01-01	2008-08-11	"At present, forest cover in southwestern Ontario, Canada, remains at less than 5% due to intensive agricultural and urban land use. Although much of the extant forest is increasingly protected by legislation, remnants continue to be degraded by the spread of non-native plant species, overgrazing, and recreational use. Some parks in the region have adopted management programs aimed at mitigating this degradation. Over the last 35 years, cottages and roads at Point Pelee National Park have been removed and sites either passively restored (i.e. road or cottage eliminated and vegetation allowed to regenerate) or actively restored (i.e. road or cottage eliminated, exotic vegetation removed, and native species planted). In 1994 and 1995, the overall eï¬€ectiveness of the restoration program was evaluated by comparing the understory plant communities in 28 restored sites with those in less disturbed reference sites. There was found to be a signiï¬cant increase in the similarity of understory plant communities between restored and reference sites as time-since-restoration increased. Soil moisture, canopy cover, distance to continuous forest, and site-shape all signiï¬cantly aï¬€ected plant species composition. Former road sites recovered signiï¬cantly more rapidly than former cottage sites, and the former lawns of passively restored cottage sites were the slowest to recover. Five years following active restoration, non-native ruderal species continued to dominate restored sites. The observed recovery of understorey plant communities in restored sites is attributed to their proximity to natural vegetation, and its function as a seed source. In some sites, recovery is substantial and, assuming present trajectories of change are maintained, we predict that recovery could occur in many mesic sites within the next 20 years. Restoration activity facilitates forest recovery and would appear to have a valuable function in mitigating ongoing conï¬‚icts between conservation and human use in this region.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Agricultural and urban land-use dominate the landscape of southwestern Ontario, the most densely populated region of Canada. Forest cover is less than 5% and remnants tend to be small, isolated, and privately owned. Currently, 40% of Ontario’s rare plant species are restricted to this ecoregion, known as the Deciduous or Carolinian Forest Zone. Although conservation efforts have focused on habitat protection, either through the creation of parks and conservation areas or, when privately owned, through trust and stewardship agreements, these protected areas are, and continue to be, degraded. Causes of this degradation are the spread of non-native species, deer overgrazing, as well as recreational land use. Historically, land uses in this area were commercially driven, either for wood production or the reduction of soil erosion. But, as with most production forests, the understory has not been viewed only through the prism of undermining tre productivity and regeneration, and thus has been controlled with herbicides, cultivation, and mowing. The project was conducted at Point Pelee National Park in southwestern Ontario, which had been subjected to extensive human use and disturbance in the past. Prior to be designated a park in 1918, Point Pelee was cleared of white pine and is now dominated by hackberry and to a lesser extent, black maple and white ash. Agriculture peaked in the 1950s when 40% of the park was allocated to orchard, crop, and vegetable production. By 1960, 600 cottages and numerous roads were situated in the park and 500,000 people visited each year. At this time, park managers initiated an intensive naturalization program and over the past 35 years most of the cottages and roads have been removed. Geography and the moderating effects of Lake Erie have allowed southern plants and animals to flourish at Point Pelee. The vast forest of deciduous trees is the northern end of a broad belt which extends from the coastal zone of the Carolinas, northward between the Mississippi River and the Appalachian Mountains, to southern Ontario. The Canadian Carolinian Zone stays much warmer than similarly situated areas because of Lake Erie and the lake effects that result from the cushioning of temperature peaks. This area has tremendous variety and endemism, with more rare species than any other region in Canada. The specific goals of this project were: 1) to assess the impact of 40 years of habitat restoration on understory plant communities; 2) to compare the composition of understorey communities in restored and relatively undisturbed, reference deciduous forest sites at Point Pelee and Fish Point; 3) to relate changes in species composition to environmental variables expected to affect rates of forest recovery; and 4) to compare the relative effectiveness of passive and active restoration. The project hypothesized that restored sites would show an increased similarity to reference sites over time, and that active habitat restoration aimed at accelerating desirable vegetation change would be more effective than passive restoration.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Forest restoration in southern Ontario has centered on the planting of trees on marginal farmland since the turn of the century. These plantations have the potential to generate additional forest habitat, provide buffer zones for pre-existing habitat, and increase connectivity among remnant patches of forest. However, in practice, they have tended to be management-intensive, have remained largely isolated from surrounding natural or restored habitat, and have born little resemblance to adjacent pre-existing forest. Even when unmagaged, however, the understory flora may take decades, if not centuries to recover without some form of intervention. Many recent forest restoration efforts in southern Ontario have taken more comprehensive approaches, these efforts increasing the scale from individual tree species to that of the ecosystem or landscape, involving a diverse set of stakeholders, and incorporating adaptive management strategies.

Description of Project Activities: While restoration efforts had been ongoing, both active and passive, since the 1960s this project sought to quantitatively assess the results of those efforts. Starting in 1994, 28 former road and cottage sites were identiï¬ed throughout Point Pelee using aerial photographs, park blueprints and input from long-time park employees. Sites were categorized according to their date of restoration and a preliminary visual assessment of soil moisture. Because of the long history of widespread disturbance in Point Pelee, three relatively undisturbed reference sites (10 m x 80 m) were located at Fish Point. In 1995, three additional reference sites (10 m x 80 m) were identiï¬ed in relatively undisturbed upland forest at Point Pelee, using park records to ensure that these sites had never been used as cottages or roads and that they had been distant from past recreational areas. The herbaceous plant community in all sites was measured in June and September 1994 and May 1995, with the exception of the reference sites at Point Pelee, which were measured in May and September 1995. In addition, for comparison purposes, eight quadrats were located in part of an actively restored site that had been inadvertently left unchanged. For each quadrat, the maximum cover value for each species was selected from the multiple sample dates. Depending on site area and habitat heterogeneity, between 13 and 22 1 m x 1 m quadrats were randomly located in each of the 34 sites, approximately 10 m apart. Pins were used to mark the SE corner of each quadrat. The percent cover of all herbaceous species, and woody species less than 40 cm in height, was recorded. Species nomenclature followed Morton and Venn (1990) and voucher specimens were deposited in the Point Pelee herbarium. Non-native species were deï¬ned as having been introduced to Point Pelee since European settlement (c. 1700) according to Jellicoe and Rudkin (1984). Environmental data collected at all sites in both Point Pelee and Fish Point included soil moisture, canopy cover, and topography. Eight soil samples were taken from each site within a two-day period in both September 1994 and June 1995, and analyzed for moisture content. Samples were dried at 100  C for 24 h before weighing. Percent canopy cover was estimated for all quadrats in all sites. Surface topography was qualitatively assessed and sites were classiï¬ed as 0 (ï¬‚at), 1 (rolling), or 2 (hilly). Historical forest data for restored sites at Point Pelee were collected from aerial photos taken in 1933, 1955, 1968, and 1973, using the set that most closely preceded the restoration date. Cottages and roads restored since 1983 were initially described using the most recent aerial photo and corroborated by ground truthing. Measurements estimated from aerial photos were (1) the size of the forest gap in which the cottage or road had been situated, (2) site area of the cottage or road, (3) distance to continuous forest, (4) proportion of the site, boundary that was adjacent to forest, (5) whether sites had formerly been cottages or roads, (6) whether sites had been actively or passively restored, and (7) shape index.  Although reference sites in Point Pelee had not been used previously as cottages or roads, the high overall disturbance level in the park led project managers to believe that all in-park habitat had been disturbed or degraded at some time.  This accounts for the use of Fish Point as an endpoint, partly because it provided the most conservative measure of forest recovery. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Overall, the results of the study indicate that these disturbed forest sites are recovering from their former use as cottages and roads, that restoration is having a desirable eï¬€ect, and, should recovery continue, that mesic sites that are relatively close to continuous forest will be largely similar to the high quality reference sites, perhaps within 50 years. Project researchers used an increasing similarity between restored sites and high-quality reference sites as the primary gauge of forest recovery. Although a dependence on the use of ""˜""˜reference'' sites has been questioned, the objective for this project, unlike many restoration studies, was never to deï¬ne recovery as the return to pre-existing site-conditions, nor even to deï¬ne the reference sites at Fish Point as the goal of recovery. Rather, the goal was to assess whether the observed, and inevitable, changes regarding plant species composition in restored sites at Point Pelee indicated that recovery was occurring along a desirable, management-deï¬ned trajectory. Researchers used the nearby relatively undisturbed Fish Point sites to assess the direction and degree of change. That the three Fish Point sites were the most similar to one another and that the least disturbed (i.e. reference) sites at Point Pelee sites were the most similar to sites at Fish Point sites of all the Point Pelee sites, suggests that Fish Point was a suitable choice for reference sites. Researchers deliberately used Fish Point as the end point, rather than reference sites at Point Pelee, in large part because of the low, historical levels of disturbance at Fish Point. This, then, represents a more conservative means of estimating recovery than would comparisons between the reference and restored sites within Point Pelee.  These results may seem to contrast with some other studies of restoration of disturbed natural habitats that have estimated recovery periods of many decades, or even centuries. These studies frequently describe larger-scale disturbance, such as forest clearing and ï¬‚ooding.  This study and others that indicate relatively rapid site recovery seems to involve smaller-scale disturbances, as only one restored site (Tav) was greater than 80 m from standing, continuous forest. However, recovery was far from consistent across all the study sites. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The relatively small distances appeared to be too great for some dispersal-restricted species that remained absent from restored sites. For example, ant-dispersed Dicentra cucullaria (Dutchman's britches) failed to establish in one restored site (MarsC), despite the presence of a large population 20 m away on the other side of a road. Instead, restored sites were dominated by wind and vertebrate dispersed species that tend to have dispersal distances of two to three orders of magnitude higher than dispersal-restricted species. Although one restored site at Point Pelee (PostH) was more similar to reference sites at Fish Point sites than were the reference sites at Point Pelee, it too still lacked typical understory species such as Trillium grandiï¬‚orum (trillium), Arisaema triphyllum (Jack-in-the-pulpit), and 
Dicentra cucullaria. Their absence from restored sites is associated with restricted seed dispersal and early-season ï¬‚owering phenology traits, and the apparent inability of ephemerals to compete with ruderal species in these disturbed environments.  Spring ephemerals were recorded in only one restored site, MarsC. Their presence could be attributed to a number of contiguous, remnant populations of Arisaema triphyllum and Hydrophyllum appendiculatum present at the edges of the site. Thus, the availability of propagules appears to be a major factor aï¬€ecting recovery rates in this study. Long-term disturbance at Point Pelee has resulted in a species-poor seedbank, dominated by non-native species.  Therefore, species availability in restored sites was largely dependent on seed immigration from surrounding forest. As time since restoration increased and opportunities for seed immigration continued, native species richness of the seedbank increased.  Forest recovery appeared to occur more quickly in road than in cottage sites at Point Pelee, in contrast to other studies showing that soil compaction on logging roads tends to impede forest regeneration. Although roads in this study were smaller and showed less use than most logging roads, many had been extensively used since at least 1933. Seed availability might also be greater for road sites as they had comparatively high shape index and proportion-of-adjacent-forest and low distance to continuous forest. Converted cottage sites also were dominated by former lawn species that can inhibit vegetational change. 
Researchers had anticipated that active restoration would result in greater and more rapid forest recovery. However, the beneï¬ts were still equivocal 6 years after restoration. Most actively restored sites had higher non-native diversity and were dominated by ruderal, often non-native, species, unlike passively restored sites that were often associated with herbs characteristic of recovered and reference sites. In general, actively restored sites had been more recently converted and were subjected to relatively intense disturbance events such as bulldozing and planting and, thus, active restoration became an eï¬€ective measure of disturbance. After six years, the impact of active restoration, however benign in intention, was no diï¬€erent, in eï¬€ect, from any other intense, localized disturbance. The long-term 
eï¬€ects and beneï¬ts of active restoration have yet to be determined.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Most protected areas located in human-dominated landscapes are subject to intensive human use. Although this tends to contribute to the degradation of the extant natural habitat, such areas still have considerable conservation and educational value. In many cases managers are attempting to mitigate this degradation by adopting ""˜""˜naturalization'' programs similar to those conducted at Point Pelee. However, there may be signiï¬cant associated costs beyond those of the restoration activity itself. As parks become less amenable to recreational and residential use, visitor numbers often decrease; at Point Pelee, visitation is approximately half of what it was two decades ago when recreation was dominated by cottage and beach use. Decreases in government funding and park services, and the resistance to increases in entrance fees, may force some parks to choose between conservation and recreation priorities. In contrast, this study shows that these priorities may not be incompatible. We found that highly degraded areas can be successfully restored as long as there are viable seed sources. Although some use-associated degradation is inevitable, it is likely to be temporary and can be mitigated by restoration. Forest restoration practices at Point Pelee have changed signiï¬cantly over the last 40 years. Simple removal of cottages and roads and natural regeneration has been largely replaced by active restoration, whereby non-native species are removed, topography returned, and park-grown shrubs and trees planted extensively. Despite being dominated by ruderals six years after site conversion, apparent beneï¬ts for actively restored sites include an increase in aesthetic value associated with increases in canopy cover and topography, a decrease in the dominance of succession-inhibiting former lawn species, and an increase in education value and awareness. Future restoration eï¬€orts should also include vulnerable ephemeral and dispersal-restricted herbaceous species that largely remain absent from restored sites. Regardless of the type of restoration activity undertaken and the limited recovery of a number of vulnerable species, the results of our study strongly suggest that restoration has facilitated the recovery of a protected area that continues to be degraded by human use, overgrazing by deer, and invasion by non-native plant species, and that this activity should be continued in the future.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-maine-multi-species-seabird-colony-restoration/	USA: Maine: Multi-species Seabird Colony Restoration	United States of America	1984-01-01	1996-12-31	"Nesting herring and great black-backed gulls (Larus argentatus and Larus marinus) were removed from a recently abandoned tern (Sterna sp.) colony through a combination of poisoning and shooting. Following gull control, all three species of tern that had nested in the colony prior to the arrival of the gulls returned and nested in increasing numbers. In addition to the restoration of the terns, removal of the gulls led to colonization and/or significant increases in populations of four other seabirds. Gull numbers were greatly reduced by initial poisoning efforts, but continued immigration from surrounding colonies has required an on-going program of shooting to eliminate territorial birds nesting in areas utilized by terns and other species. In situations calling for active management it is reasonable to advocate rapid, focused intervention, and stress the importance of inter-organizational cooperation, and an active program of public education.Fisheries & Aquaculture, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Other In the late 19th century a combination of hunting pressure and extensive use of coastal and outer islands by fisher-folk led to the almost complete disappearance of most seabirds including gulls and terns. Changes in land-use practices and the elimination of plume hunting resulting in a widespread recovery of most species that lasted into the mid-1940s. By the 1950s it was apparent that populations of the herring gull and the great black-backed gull had continued to expand, populations of other seabirds were once more in decline. The suspected primary cause of the decline was predation and/or territorial behavior by the large larids. The population of herring and great black-backed gulls was supported by the presence of large open landfills along the entire New England coast as well as the disposal of fisheries by-catch. By the 1960s the bulk of the remaining arctic, common and roseate terns were concentrated on islands containing manned light-stations. Coast Guard personnel, concerned about he impact of bird droppings on their water sources, tended to shoot or otherwise discourage herring and great black-backed gulls from nesting on with light-stations. Terns and other seabirds, which were likely to roots near human-occupied structures, were largely ignored, with the result that the lighthouse islands became de facto refuges. Automation of the light stations in the 1960s and early 1970s was followed by the colonization of the lighthouse islands by large gulls and the collapse of tern colonies. The Gulf of Main in eastern North America contains over 6000 islands, many of which have been historical nesting sites for seabirds. The Petit Manan/Green Island archipelago was an important nesting site for terns since at least 1931. After human occupation of the island ceased in 1975, increasing numbers of herring and great black-backed gulls moved on Petit Manan and displaced the tern population in a fashion seen elsewhere in New England. A census in 1983 revealed that only two arctic terns and no common or roseate terns were nesting on the island, compared to over 1500 pairs (all three species combined) reported in the late 1960s. The impact of increasing number of large gulls, particularly herring gulls, and greater black backed gulls has been of concern in Britain, Europe, and the eastern United States for much of the latter part of this century. Gulls have been implicated in the spread of disease, collisions with aircraft, and predation on other species of waterfowl. In the present project, it is this latter effect and its remediation that was most relevant.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Discussion among private, federal and state organizations during the 1970s and early 1980s led to a general agreement on the need to reestablish populations of terns and other seabirds at a variety of sites along the north-eastern seaboard of the United States. Following an initial success, gull removal programs have been initiated on nine islands in the Gulf of Maine. This project evaluated the effect of gull control on an island cooperatively managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Island Research Center at the College of the Atlantic in the state of Maine. Results from this island are compared to changes in nesting numbers on other seabird nesting islands in the Gulf of Maine.

Description of Project Activities: In 1984 the US Fish and Wildlife Service initiated a gull-control program. The avicide DRC1339 was placed in gull nests on both Petit Manan and Green Islands. Poisoning on Petit Manan ceased after 1984; however it continued yearly on Green Island through 1987 and a final poisoning was conducted on Green Island in 1990. No further management activity has been conducted on Green Island except for periodic censusing. Every year, since 1985, one to four pairs of herring or great black-backed gull pairs have attempted to nest on Petit Manan. Birds attempting to nest or seen actively harassing terns, black guillemots (Cepphus grylle) or laughing gulls (Larus atricilla) have been killed with a 0.22 rifle. Gulls loafng on the lower intertidal of Petit Manan have been left undisturbed. Since 1985 Petit Manan Island has been searched thoroughly for nesting terns during the peak laying time period. The search is conducted by four to six researchers walking in line at arms' length apart. Each nest is marked with a numbered 10 cm wooden stake. At the conclusion of the count, one researcher walks back through the colony in a zigzag pattern at right angles to the route of the original count. This individual records the number of marked and unmarked nests encountered. The resulting ratio (typically between 0.05 and 0.07) is applied to the initial total as a `correction factor' for missed nests. Laughing gulls have nested on Petit Manan at least since the early 1960s. Prior to 1989, counts of laughing gulls consisted of transects taken through areas of presumed maximal density, with extrapolations providing an estimate for the island as a whole. Since 1989, all areas of the island have been searched for nests. With the exception of six black guillemot nests located in 1995, Green Island has only provided nesting sites for common eiders (Somateria mollissima), herring gulls and great black-backed gulls. Data for eiders on the two islands has traditionally been combined in reports, but the majority of eiders seem to have always nested on Green Island. Common eider duck nests were counted on Petit Manan Island in mid-June as part of the laughing gull census. Green Island was censused in late May approximately every 3 years. Total nests are reported as the sum of the number of nests found on both islands. Nesting burrows of black guillemots and Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica) were located through intensive searches of the rocky berm surrounding the island. The number of herring and great black-backed gulls nesting on Petit Manan and Green Islands was recorded in the course of poisoning sweeps and/or censuses of each island in late May or early June. Comparative data of seabird colonies on other islands in the Gulf of Maine were obtained from Erwin and Korschgen (1979) and the State of Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Gull control has been used as a management technique on many seabird colonies on both sides of the Atlantic. On Petit Manan Island the initial applications of DRC1339 in 1984 coupled with an on-going human presence each summer has essentially eliminated nesting herring and great black-backed gulls. Gull control on nearby Green Island has stabilized the number of nesting gulls but has failed to rid the island of a base population of approximately 120Â±150 pairs. During years in which active gull control occurred on Green Island very few gull chicks fledged, thus the continued settlement of gulls on Green Island and the limited nesting attempts on Petit Manan must be due to immigration from other colonies. Only the continued presence of the research team has kept Petit Manan relatively free of large gulls. In terms of its primary goal of the restoration of a viable tern colony on Petit Manan Island, the gull control project has been an unqualified success. From near collapse in 1983 total tern numbers in the colony have increased to a record high of over 2000 pairs in 1995. In the early 1970s, prior to the arrival of herring and great black-backed gulls on the island, common tern numbers increased and arctic tern numbers declined leading to equal proportions of the two species by the mid-1970s. In the first few years of management, arctic terns outnumbered common terns, but by 1988 the common tern had become dominant, a status they retain through the present day. This change in relative proportion may be part of a general northward shift in the arctic tern's nesting range. One reason for the decline in nesting arctic terns on Petit Manan may be the establishment of another tern colony in more suitable arctic tern habitat. In 1984 the National Audubon Society and the US Fish and Wildlife Service removed gulls from a large segment of Seal Island in Penobscot Bay, approximately 90 km west of Petit Manan and 32 km offshore as part of a project to attract Atlantic puffins and other seabird species to the area. In 1989 arctic terns first nested on Seal Island, and numbers increased to a high of approximately 500 pairs in 1995. Arctic terns are known to favor outer islands, and the initial development of this colony, which had not been active since the early 1950s, could only come at the expense of other nearby colonies such as Petit Manan. The roseate tern's status as both a state and US federally listed endangered species has been a significant component of management concern. Roseate tern numbers on Petit Manan Island increased through 1993. In 1994 and 1995 nesting pairs of herring gulls were found in the dense vegetation at two sites used in previous seasons by small clusters of six to nine pairs of roseate terns. Although the gull nests were destroyed upon discovery, the gulls were present during the peak nesting period for terns, and no birds settled in the areas. This example illustrates the potential impact of small numbers of territorial gulls on the restoration effort. Some of the increase in laughing gulls may be due to recruitment from expanding colonies in southern New England, but it is also likely that local fledging success has benefited from reduced predation. Prior to the removal of herring and great black-backed gulls, the laughing gulls on Petit Manan nested in the densest vegetation on the island. As the number of laughing gulls has increased over the course of the management program the laughing gulls have spread into less densely vegetated areas. Part of this change in distribution may be due to vegetation changes, but it seems likely that the elimination of large territorial gulls has freed the laughing gulls to make greater use of more of the island. Laughing gulls in Maine nest only on managed islands. Common eider ducks appear to have benefited from the reduction in predatory gulls on Petit Manan and Green Islands. It should be noted, however, that although eiders suffer severe chick predation from large gulls, evidence from Finland suggests that it may be beneficial for eiders to nest on islands that have at least some gulls capable of driving away crows and ravens (Corvus sp). Corvids are extremely effective predators on eider eggs, and it is possible that the loss of some chicks to gulls is preferable to the loss of an entire clutch of eggs to a raven. Ravens have attempted to nest on four occasions on Petit Manan since the gulls were removed, and have preyed on eider nests, but they have not nested on Green Island. Eider ducks appear to use small coves along the eastern and southern edge of Petit Manan as relatively gull-free nurseries' prior to dispersal to the mainland bays. Creches of 5Â±15 eider chicks are regularly observed around Petit Manan, these are seldom seen near Green Island. Although small numbers of black guillemots had been known to nest on Petit Manan prior to the collapse of the tern colony, their numbers have increased substantially under the management program. The lack of deep crevices or suitable soil for burrowing makes these birds vulnerable to predation by loafing gulls. It is worth suggesting that black guillemots are willing to nest in less suitable substrate on the island, where protection is provided by the management team, in preference to suffering higher levels of interference and predation on unmanaged islands. The establishment of nesting Atlantic puffins on Petit Manan may be part of a larger southward expansion of this species' range. Some banded birds from the Audubon Society's reintroduction program in Penobscot Bay have been seen on the island, however the proportion of these birds has declined significantly in recent years. A number of islands with apparently more suitable habitat exist between the nearest naturally occurring Atlantic puffin colony on Machias Seal Island, Canada and Petit Manan, yet only Petit Manan has been selected as breeding site. As with the black guillemots, the elimination of predatory gulls seems to be a benefit that outweighs the advantage of better nesting substrate. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: It is important to differentiate between changes directly caused by management activities and changes that are part of larger regional trends that may mimic, amplify, or mask presumed management outcomes. Islands vary significantly in area, history, vegetation, topography, and distance from shore and other islands. A precise control for any management treatment is impossible. Populations of all these species have changed during the course of the management program, with some of these changes are doubtless occurring independently of management efforts.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Perhaps the most heartening aspect of this project has been the level of collaboration achieved between federal, state and private organizations. Representatives of a wide variety of groups involved in seabird conservation in the Northeastern US meet twice each year under the aegis of the Gulf of Maine Seabird Working Group to  pool data, compare techniques, and to plan future strategies. Management and research decisions are usually reached by consensus among the interested parties. A Gulf of Maine Tern Management Plan was developed as a result of the on-going dialog among members, and large portions of the Plan have been adopted into the State of Maine official planning guide. This sort of collaboration is of increasing importance as we recognize the trans-boundary nature of most conservation issues.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/finland-restoration-of-semi-natural-meadows-using-sheep/	Finland: Restoration of Semi-natural Meadows using Sheep	Finland	1996-01-01	2000-12-31	"This project sought to look at the restoration of species-richness of an overgrown semi-natural mesic meadow using sheep grazing after a long period of abandonment. Plant cover was studies in both grazed and ungrazed plots for five years and the responses of different functional plant groups were followed (herbs vs. grasses, tall vs. short species, species differing in flowering time, species representing different Grime’s GSR strategies and species indicative of rich vs. poor soil). The project found that grazing increased species number by 30%. On grazed plots litter cover practically disappeared, favoring small herbs such as Rhinanthus minor, Ranunculus acris, Trifolium pratense and the grass Agrostis capillaris. Grazing decreased the cover of late flowering tall herb Epilobium angustifolium but had no effect on the abundance of the early flowering tall herbs Anthriscus sylvestris or Geranium sylvaticum. The project determined that success in restoration requires the determination of the responses of different functional plant groups to grazing. This information optimizes the methods and timing of management used in restoration. Additional management practices, such as mowing, may be needed in mesic meadows to decrease the dominance of tall species. The availability of propagules seemed to restrict further increase of species richness in the study area.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation, Other The threat to species richness in these ecosystems is the rapid decline of semi-natural meadows which has taken place during recent decades in many European countries. In Finland, the area of these meadows reached a maximum of 1.6 million hectares in the 1880s, but had declined to only 18,690 hectares in the 1990s. The meadow’s composition differs from other previously described vegetation, partly because of eutrophication, shrub encroachment, and the decline of traditional management methods that are all cited as reasons for the decline. The plowing and sowing of commercial forage plants and the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides have impoverished the flora and fauna in these specific habitats. The plots used in the project were established in 1996 in a former pasture that had been used until 1969 and then only occasionally in the 1980s. Traditional, low intensity management of semi-natural grasslands has enriched the flora and fauna in many European countries. Many species are dependent on these man-made environments, in Finland 28% of the threatened plant and animal species live on semi-natural grasslands. This project sought to examine whether the responses of different functional plant groups to grazing could be used in evaluating the success of restoration of the species richness and composition in an overgrown mesic meadow. These groups represent different successional stages and thus their reactions to grazing indicate the direction and speed of change during restoration. When the responses of different species are understood, then management practices can be optimized.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The project was critical to understand the many changes that had taken place in the Finnish semi-natural meadows over the last century. Because of the precipitous decline in the acreage of semi-natural meadows in Finland it was seen as critical that due to land abandonment, to changes in the agricultural system, and to the continuing outright decline in the type’s coverage; all were cited as reasons for intervention and restoration.

Description of Project Activities: The experimental plots where the project were conducted were at two meadow patches, ca. 50 m apart. At both sites, seven 1-sq m permanent plots were located in a 10 m x 10 m grid. Seven of these plots were selected by stratified random sampling to be grazed and seven were protected from grazing by fencing (controls). The east site (E) had three grazed and four control plots and there were four grazed and three controls on the west site (W). In the first year of the survey, grazing started in early August and continued until the beginning of October. In 1997-1999, the grazing period was 1 July to 30 Sept. (in two periods of 2-3 weeks). The stocking rate was 15 sheep to an area of ca. 1.5 ha, grazed to low height. Percentage cover of all vascular plant species and litter was visually estimated for each square meter plot in mid-June each year recognized set cover values. The same person estimated cover throughout the project. The change in vegetation was studied by looking at the reactions of different functional plant groups: herbs vs. grasses, tall vs. short species, species differing in flowering time, species representing different Grime's CSR strategies, and species that were indicative of rich vs. poor soil.  Using all of these functional traits and classifications, species were classified into seven ecological groups.  Soil analysis was done at the beginning of the experiment in 1996, with samples taken just outside the corner of each plot and all the data was pooled. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: At the beginning of the experiment, the mean number of vascular plant species per plot was ca. 14 in both grazed and ungrazed plots. After three years of grazing, the number of species started to increase in the grazed plots, but remained constant in the exclosures. By year 5 (2000), the mean number of species in the grazed plots had increased by 4.1 Â± 0.9 (mean Â± 1 s.e.) species. Most species that invaded grazed plots were already present in the community. Their cover increased when grazing removed the accumulated litter and suppressed the dominant species. Some small herbs, indicating the success of management invaded the grazed plots: Rhinanthus minor (invaded two plots), Cerastium fontanum (3), Stellaria graminea (3), Trifolium pratense (3) and Taraxacum spec. (four plots). Litter cover decreased in the grazed plots compared to the controls and at the end of the study in grazed plots litter was minimal when cover in the control plots was 31%. Grazing had little effect on the early flowering tall herbs Anthriscus sylvestris and Geranium sylvaticum as they had already flowered and started to reallocate resources to their roots when grazing started in July. In contrast, Epilobium angustifolium and Filipendula ulmaria are tall herbs, flowering at the end of July which explains their decrease in the grazed plots results indicate that the abundance of these tall herbs (C strategists) can be decreased if grazing occurs just before flowering. Small herbs increased in cover when grazing suppressed the cover of competitively superior tall herbs and decreased the litter cover. Many of these herbs are general strategists and grow in various habitats. Grazing favored some small and creeping herbs, such as Cerastium fontanum, Stellaria graminea and Trifolium pratense. Ranunculus acris and Trollius europaeus are poisonous species and are avoided by grazers. Two C-strategy tall grasses, Alopecurus pratensis and Elymus repens, decreased in response to grazing. These grasses are nitrophilous to some extent, and are therefore expected to decrease in the long-term when grazing removes nutrients via consumed biomass. In contrast, smaller grasses that favour intermediate rich soil conditions, i.e. Agrostis capillaris (CSR-strategist), Anthoxanthum odoratum and Festuca ovina (S-stress tolerators), increased due to grazing. The results suggest that it is useful to study the responses of different functional plant groups to grazing. Individual species may be too scarce for changes in their abundances to be seen but by following reasonable species groups much valuable data could be acquired. By using this information grassland managers can optimize the method and timing of management practices to succeed in restoration. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Mere low intensity sheep grazing has been successful in managing low productive hill pastures. In more productive habitats, however, a surplus of soil nutrients may retard the change of vegetation, and hence grazing along may be insufficient to achieve quick results. In this project, a combination of early mowing followed by grazing would probably have given better results.  Early mowing combined with grazing would effectively suppress the dominance of early flowering tall herbs. Another possibility is to start grazing earlier in summer. Spring grazing has been shown to increase species richness in low land meadows, but in long used upland meadows some of these strategies had no effect on species richness.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Grazing increased the mean number of species per plot by 29.5% with this project, but the increase was largely due to the spread of species already present in the community.  The slow increase in the number of species might result from the lack of old managed meadows in close proximity to the restoration site.  This indicates that no artificial input of diasporas is needed where there is a sufficiently rich, local species pool.  Sometimes the presence of a seed bank my help, but most grassland species disappear from the seed bank after some years of abandonment.  Grazing is preferred to mowing because animals are able to spread plant propagules.
The target community in this area will be a low productive meadow with many small herbs and grasses. Ordination of the data showed that the community moved towards the desired state with many small growing herbs, following grazing. Small herbs that are currently absent, but those which could be imported into and spread in the area include Antennaria dioica, Erigeron acer, Fragaria vesca, Leucanthemum vulgare, and Veronica officinalis. One point for further monitoring is to evaluate if these species do have time to migrate in from nearby remnant meadows. The time frame of this study may not have allowed for that to have happened. One final note is that the development of such a species-rich meadow may take decades to restore. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/france-restoration-of-meuse-river-flood-plain-meadows-on-abandoned-farm-fields/	France: Restoration of Meuse River Flood-plain Meadows on Abandoned Farm Fields	France	1998-01-01	2002-12-31	"This project was an effort to restore species-rich flood-plain meadows from abandoned arable fields in the valley of the river Meuse, in northeast France. The project area was sown with a commercial seed mixture of Phleum pratense, Festuca pratensis, Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens. Before restoration, the above-ground fallow vegetation was dominated by ruderal and annual species, with only a few meadow species present. Sowing led to tall, dense vegetation, mainly dominated by sown species. Ruderal and annual species had decreased three years after the restoration, but target species still remained underrepresented. Species richness was significantly lower in the sown site than in the semi-natural target meadows and the vegetation had a different composition. Further analysis of the soil seed bank of the restored soil seed bank had a different composition: one of only a few meadow species, but dominated by a few ruderal species. Three years of the restoration project and the site is moving toward the target communities but impoverished seed sources limit the success of the restoration.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation While previously used for low intensity hay-making, these flood-plain meadows were, over the last fifty years, converted into more intensively used fields. They were drained, protected against flooding, fertilized more, cut earlier and more frequently and often converted into arable land. The combination of high productivity lands (a consequence of increase nutrient availability) and an absence of viable propagules of characteristic species appear to cause bottlenecks for restoration. Part of the reason for this is that conversion to arable fields that are tilled, plowed, and grow crops result in the depletion of the soil seed bank, as well a complete modification of the chemical composition of the soil. The restoration site was tilled for maize cultivation from 1988 to 1993, but was flooded too often to be suitable for regular cultivation. The area was abandoned for 5 years and recolonized naturally by species such as Cirsium arvense and Urtica dioica. Flood-plain meadows are ecosystems are heavily influenced by spring and winter flooding. Typically, they have high productivity with a substantial exchange of matter and energy with the river, and may support typical, species-rich plant communities. These flood-plain meadows were flooded frequently and were used for hay-making under a low-intensity management regime. In the semi-natural meadows of the Meuse, three associations were distinguished along the wetness gradient: Colchico-Festucetum pratensis mesophilic meadow, occurring in higher areas of the valley. This is rarely flooded. In contains mesoxerophilic (Primula veris, Avenula pubescens) and more mesophilic or meso-hygrophilic species (Peucedanum carvifolia, Galium verum, Ranunculus acris).; Senecioni-Oenanthetum mediae mesohygrophilic meadow, situated at intermediate topographic positions, where the floods last longer and occur more frequently. This is a meadow community dominated by grasses (Phleum pratense, Festuca pratensis, Anthoxanthum odoratum) but with mesohygrophilic and mesophilic species (Glechoma hederacea, Galium palustre, Achillea ptarmica, Centaurea jacea, Senecio aquaticus).; Gratiolo-Oenanthetum fistulosae hygrophilic meadow, located in the lower areas of the valley. This type is flooded most frequently and for long periods and is characterized by some mesophilic and mesohygrophilic meadow species, mixed with heleophytes (Oenanthe fistulosa, Eleocharis palustris). Based on different topographic levels within the site, which control both flooding frequency and duration, all three communities could potentially occur in the restored meadow. The goals of the project were: 1) to analyze vegetation changes after sowing; 2) to compare the vegetation after sowing with that before sowing and with the composition of characteristic species-rich target meadows; 3) to estimate the contribution of the soil seed bank in the restoration of species-rich flood-plain meadows.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
This project was conducted as part of a large scale practical restoration scheme to discuss the interest of restoration attempts realized in France. It was decided that such a project would have to be low-impact and could not cost a lot of money as one element of the project was to keep the farmers managing the land. The sown species were chosen because they are present in flood-plain meadows of the Meuse and allow for a sufficiently high production that produces high-quality hay, even with late cutting dates. Festuca pratensis and Lolium perenne establish rapidly and are highly productive, while Trifolium repens is low and provides structural heterogeneity to the vegetation.

Description of Project Activities: In 1998 the restoration project got under way, when the above-ground vegetation was mown and plowed and then in autumn the site was sown with the commercial seed mixture of Phleum pratense, Lolium perenne, Festuca pratensis, and Trifolium repens. The initial sowing density was increased by the farming, rendering the exact density unknown, however it is estimated to have been 30-35 kg-seed/ha.  Once sowed the vegetation was cut twice a year (late June, late August) and fertilization was no longer allowed. Soil samples were collected from target and experimental meadows (before and after sowing) to assess the chemical composition of the site.  Nine permanent plots of 4 sq m were established in 1998 before sowing, then in 1999, 12 plots were added.  All 21 plots were surveyed during 3 years following sowing. Vegetation dynamics were monitored on these plots with species frequency assessed from its frequency in 25 hand-fulls of vegetation.  To compare changes in the floristic composition over the four year project, the species were arranged into five groups: sown-mixture species, annual species, ruderal species, meadow grasses and other meadow species. In June 2001, phytosociological releves of 25 sq m adjacent to the 21 plots were done in order to allow for comparison with the vegetation of target meadows.  Ten releves in each of the three grassland communities present in the Meuse valley. These grasslands were semi-natural meadows where agricultural management had been extensive and stable for at least ten years.  Soil seed bank composition during the fallow phase was analyzed at 11 sites, with ten replicates taken from each study site from the top 10 cm with a 4-cm diameter drill.   Each sample represented a soil volume of 1256 cubic cm. Those samples were taken in April 1998, stored, cleaned, and sieved, and then put in soil in a greenhouse.  Watered everyday, the seedlings that emerged were identified, counted and remove. Unidentifiable seedlings were transplanted until they flowered and could be identified. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The above-ground vegetation at the restoration site were tall, dense, and dominated by the sown species after three years of restoration.  The ecological species groups clearly reflected the different successional stages of the area, i.e. first grassland, then cultivation, next abandonment and finally sowing.  Sown species took the place of ruderal species, such as Cirsium arvense and Epilobium sp., which dominated the vegetation during the period of abandonment.  Re-establishment of target meadow species, such as Plantago lanceolate and Leucanthemum vulgare, occurred in only a few plots.  Only the most common meadow grasses were present and abundant, especially Poa trivialis and Elymus repens, probably due to their high vegetative reproduction. The plowing and sowing initially led to a reduction in meadow species, but these species quickly reappeared in the above-ground vegetation. These disturbances also led to an increase in frequency of annual species and the maintenance of ruderal species.  Both grouns of species decreased slowly with time, the cutting regime and the competition of meadow species.  The overall floristic differences between 2000 and 2001 were small, indicating that vegetation dynamics were then slower than at the beginning of the restoration  It was also clear that an abandonment stage of 5 years after cultivation has a positive impact on species richness and on the number of established species. The mean species richness was significantly lower in the sown meadow that in the target communities and the floristic compositions were different. Three years after sowing, common meadow species were present and well-represented, but target species were scarce and meso-oligotrophic species such as Anthoxanthum odoratum and Briza media were completely absent. Although the majority of characteristic species did not colonize the site, the presence of some does suggest a development towards the target communities.  The similarity between restored and target meadows increased significantly with time, which suggests that the restoration of the sown meadow will proceed in the direction of the target meadow.  Ultimately, further success of the restoration operations will depend on seed sources. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: It may have been possible to recreate a meadow directly from the cultivation stage by mowing the established vegetation without plowing and sowing.  Additionally, the floristic composition of the cultivation fallow was dominated by ruderal species but meadow species were equally present, however, sowing was considered essential in order to provide quality hay so that farmers would be willing to manage the area. The results of the soil seed bank also indicated limits to this type of restoration as it was dominated by only a few species, while many of the target meadow species were not found.  This indicated that seed mortality is directly related to cultivation period.  It is likely that the soil seed bank is partly destroyed during cultivation, probably due to physical damage with agricultural machines, through chemical destruction by pesticides, and my burial of seeds by plowing.  The distance from target communities is a distinct limitation to the success of the restoration.  The window of a three year project was insufficient to gauge the effects of the target communities, as they were unable over that length of time to cover the distance of several hundred meters between species-rich source areas and restored sites.  Without seeds in the seed bank, they need to disperse to the restored area.  The limitations of seed dispersal indicates that it is a key limitation in the restoration of species richness, unless the site is surrounded by species-rich meadows.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The project illustrated that such efforts to restore flood-plain meadows can actually restore hay meadows, although it is limited in restoring species-richness.  The use of sown commercial seed mixes provided farmers with a means for restoring their previous source of hay, and was a means for altering the ecological trajectory of the system in an alternative direction.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/spain-restoration-in-sierra-nevada-protected-area/	Spain: Restoration in Sierra Nevada Protected Area	Spain	1997-01-01	2002-12-31	"After a millenarian history of overexploitation, most forests in the Mediterranean Basin have disappeared, leaving many degraded landscapes that have been colonized by early successional shrub-dominated communities. Common reforestation techniques see such shrub communities as competitors against newly planted trees, so such shrubs are commonly cleared before tree planting. However, empirical studies suggest that in stress-prone Mediterranean environments, shrubs have a net positive effect on recruitment of other speces. Between 1997 and 2001, this project examined a series of experimental reforestations in the Sierra Nevada Protected Area in southeast Spain aimed at comparing the survival and growth of seedlings planted in open areas and under the canopy of preexisting shrubs species. Over 18,000 seedlings of 11 woody species were planted under 16 different nurse shrubs throughout a broad geographical area, looking to evaluate the effect on the recruitment of other species. The project found that there were differences in the magnitude of interaction between reforestation success and critical periods for planting as well as the nurse effects. The project found that pioneer shrubs facilitated the establishment of woody, late-successional Mediterranean species, which can positively affect restoration success in many different ecological settings.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) This region of southern Spain has seen continual human inhabitation and use for thousands of years, it is difficult to assess or ascribe direct cause. The historic forest would be difficult to discern with any precision. The combination of long histories of inhabitation and the remnant vegetation indicate some patterns. There are pine trees (Pinus sylvestris), savin and common junipers, while in the lower valleys are gall oaks (Quercus faginaea) and native maples, prickly junipers, and many other forbs and grasses. Along the watercourses are alder, ash, elms, willows, and poplars. The project south to use the broad range of abiotic and biotic conditions of the Sierra Nevada mountains to consider both variability in space as well as in time, in order to understand the nature and strength of plant-plant interactions related to woody plant establishment. Specifically, the project addressed the following questions: 1) How doe sthe use of shrubs as microsites for planting improve seedling survival and growth?; 2) How does the effect of shrubs on seedling survival and growth vary depending on the shrub and tree species?; 3) How do the sign and magnitude of the interaction between shrubs and woody seedlings depend on spatial characteristics of the study site, such as altitude and aspect?; 4) How do sign and magnitude of the interaction between shrubs and woody seedlings depend on climatic conditions in the year of planting?

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The loss of primeval forests through a millenarian history of overexploitation in the Mediterranean Basin has left no more than 9-20% of the entire area forested, while on the Iberian Peninsula only .2% is considered natural or seminatural. Simultaneously, the surface area covered by shrublands has increased, representing a stage of degradation of mature forests as well as stages of vegetation recovery in abandoned agricultural lands. In both instances, local and regional characteristics, such as resource availability or the lack of tree propagules, act as barriers to succession and result in self-perpetuating systems that do no return to the structure and complexity of the original mature community. This necessitates some form of human intervention to assist secondary succession at the shrubland or even grassland stage to accelerate restoration of woodlands.

Description of Project Activities: The project was conducted at seven sites in the Sierra Nevada mountains, for a total of 36 1-ha plots.  Project managers planted seedlings of the following target shrub and tree species: Crataegus monogyna, Rhamnus alaternus, Retama sphaerocarpa, Quercus faginea, Q. ilex, Q. pyrenaica, Pinus halepensis, P. nigra, P. sylvestris var. nevadensis and Acer opalus ssp. granatense. These species are either commonly found in natural forests in Mediterranean climates or are endemic species of interest in conservation.  One to two year old seedlings were planted in spring (March-April) between 1997-2001 at each study site using two restoration techniques: 1) a traditional technique of planting target seedlings in open interspaces without vegetation (open microsites) and 2) an alternative technique of planting seedlings under the canopy of shrubs intermingled with the open microsites.  Seedlings were grown in nurseries under similar conditions, with the most abundant shrub species at each site chosen as nurse plants.  In total, the project used 16 nurse plant species and 11 target species for a total of 146 different plot-nurse shrub-target species combinations.  Between 50 and 60 individually tagged seedlings were planted per plot-nurse shrub-target species combination.  An automatic auger 12 cm in diameter was used to dig the planting holes 40 cm deep in an attempt to minimize disturbance to nurse and soil structure. In the autumn following transplant (after the first drought period) two characteristics per seedling were recorded: 1) survival and the cause of mortality in the case of death; and 2) growth, quantified as the elongation of the apical shoot after the first growing season. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: In 109 of the 146 experimental cases, shrubs increased seedling survival. The results overall demonstrated a generally positive correlation between woody seedling survival and the use of pioneer shrubs.  Seedling survival under shrubs more than doubled in comparison to open microsites and even up to fourfold in some experimental cases.  The results found much agreement with the hypothesis that there is little competition between shrubs and tree seedlings in the Mediterranean Basin.  The experiment showed that facilitation between shrubs and tree seedlings in Mediterranean environments is not a local or sporadic phenomenon restricted to a few species assemblages and environmental conditions, but is in fact a widespread phenomenon. From an overall conceptual standpoint, the results clearly showed that pioneer shrubs benefit the establishment of woody, late-successional species according to the model of succession by facilitation.  The project found it was clear that the planting of late-successional shrubs under primary successional shrubs was the most effective way of accelerating succession in degraded sites were direct recovery of the tree cover can be very difficult, if not impossible.  There were also differences between shrubs in their facilitative effect, where the magnitude and sign of the nurse effect on seedling survival varied from large and positive for legumes and small shrubs, through medium and positive for deciduous spiny shrubs, to large and negative for rockroses. Another positive correlation is that the excessive solar radiation present in the Mediterrancean environments is reduced in comparison to open areas when evaluating the shrub canopy shade that favors seedling performance.  The micro-climate under the canopy of the nurses is a main facilitative mechanism of woody seedling establishment. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: There were differential effects in nurse shrubs that appear to be related to the characteristics of the functional groups.  Legumes may increase survival and growth by improving soil nutrient composition due to nitrogen fixation, which is a scarce nutrient in Mediterranean soils.  The evaluation of functional groups is critical in the identification of target species because results showed that the identity of the nurse matters.  Another factor in the success of this project in Mediterranean environments was the availability of water, which lessened the negative effects that drought had on the survivability of the seedlings.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The results of this project clearly showed that the use of nurse shrubs facilitates seedling establishment in many different ecological settings in the Mediterranean mountains.  Although the project monitored one-year survival, the benefit of planting seedlings under shrubs could be translated beyond this stage to sapling or reproductive stages, since natural regeneration in Mediterranean ecosystems is mainly limited at the seedling stage and experimental reforestations reveal the bottleneck of first-summer mortality. Since most shrub species studied acted as nurses and most planted species were effectively facilitated, this technique could be used to design multispecific reforestation programs.  Since the response of shrub seedlings to the presence of a nurse plant was larger than the response of tree seedlings, this technique could be used to design a two-phase reforestation strategy, mimicking the natural process.
This project established clearly that the removal of shrubs is not appropriate for reforestation in Mediterranean mountains. The ecological reality of Mediterranean forests revealed that the natural spatial patterns of regeneration in woody vegetation (specifically the use of microsites for recruitment) are a major determinant of spatial distribution of woody seedlings. The consequence of this has clear implications for climate change. Given that the facilitative effect increases with abiotic stress, this technique might be more relevant under the predicted rise in temperatures, dryness, and rainfall variability for the Mediterranean region, the benefits of this technique are clear for the future challenges suggested under various scenarios of climate change.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/argentina-restoration-of-clearcuts-in-nahuel-huapi-national-park/	Argentina: Restoration of Clearcuts in Nahuel Huapi National Park	Argentina	1998-05-01	2000-05-31	"Earlier this century, humans introduced exotic conifers such as ponderosa pine and Douglas fir to Nahuel Huapi National Park (NHNP). Land managers in the Argentine national park service recently recognized that these trees have the potential to invade native plant communities, threaten biodiversity, and change ecosystem structure and function. To address the problem, the park service began clearcutting NHNP’s exotic conifer plantations in the 1980s, with the intention of reestablishing native trees on these sites. So far, native trees have largely failed in those clearcut sites, while many are actually supporting reinvasions of exotic trees. This project sought to examine the barriers to native tree success in those sites and investigate the possibility that a native vine (Mutisia spinosa) limits reinvasion of the clearcuts by exotic trees.Deforestation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) Exotic conifers were introduced in NHNP beginning in the early 20th century, with attention to several species of pine, Douglas fir, maples and several other non-native varieties. The inexpensiveness of land in Patagonia and the high rate of growth of pines and other trees made such species attractive economically, encouraging the spread of plantations as the original growth forest was cut down. The exotic trees are wind-dispersed but have different reproductive needs than the native trees, further altering ecosystem function. The addition of exotic wildlife, including two species of deer that remain to this day, are notable for how they affect the recruitment of native trees. The exotic trees are not as frequently browsed as the native trees, with has serious consequences for the persistence of those native plant communities. In many areas, the exotic conifers have spread beyond the boundaries and into native vegetation because of their efficient wind-dispersal. The colonization and spread of these species is unknown in its entirety because they have not been tracked. These forests in Argentina are are closed canopy temperate mesic forests with generally three dominant trees in the forest: Nothofagus dombeyi, Austrocedrus chilensis, and Lomatia hirsuta. The ecosystem historically knew little disturbance, although catastrophic fires or landslides are noted as a means for the regeneration of Nothofagus and Austrocedrus species. Nothofagus trees are broadleaved, evergreen species that flowers in austral spring and produces seeds in summer that are dispersed by gravity and wind, while Austrocedrus is in Cupressaceae, producing berrylike fruit. Lomatia is a large subcanopy species with thick tough leaves and wind-dispersed seeds. Restoration at NHNP worked with two purposes in mind: first, to prevent reinvasion and second, to reestablish native vegetation. The difficulties of the Argentine national park service in having success with their clearcutting projects necessitated an evaluation of the successional patterns that were occurring in the park. Additionally, the lack of knowledge about both abiotic and biotic conditions as well as the community-level interactions between the native and exotic vegetation provided for an improvement in the state of knowledge about both the park and the forests. Finally, the project sought to develop what were the environmentally-limiting factors to native tree survival.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The project was undertaken by the Argentine national park service as part of a larger effort to eliminate exotic conifers from parts of NHNP and restore native vegetation under guidelines adopted in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The poor to nonexistent regeneration of native species in the park was cited as a motivation for taking a more active role in restoring the ecosystems. The project investigator was a graduate student from the University of Montana.

Description of Project Activities: The first steps in the project were taken a number of years previous to the inception of this project with the clearcutting of the forest, some sites saw cutting  in stages between 1986 and 1994, and another site was cut in 1997.  A portion of one site, the Puerto Madera site (which was a P. ponderosa/P. menziesii plantation) was replanted with native seedlings in 1998.  The project evaluated this planting for experiments beginning in summer of 1999.  The Pampa Pseudotsuga  site was clearcut in the austral autumn of 1997 and was replanted the following spring with N. dombeyi, A. chilensis and L. hirsuta, however, few seedlings survived.  In May 1998, a second section of the site was chosen to be replanted again to evaluated under experimental conditions.  To evaluate the effects of shrub proximity and herbivory on growth and survival of the native species, a 48 x 90m experimental grid was established within a ponderosa clearcut at Puerto Madera. Each 4x15m section of the grid contained a shrub and an open site.  Shrub sites were considered those within 50 cm of a shrub minimally 50 cm tall and wide, with the plant on the shrubs southeast side (sheltered from afternoon sun and from the prevailing wind).  Each shrub and open site was assigned a seedling species and herbivory treatment (with or without a cage).  At Pampa Pseudotsuga trees were planted on a 54x24m grid with eighteen columns and eight rows spaced 3m apart. The trees were planted in a regular order throughout the grid, however the eight-row structure created an alternating pattern.  Half the seedlings were randomly selected for shade treatments, which was a simple metal frame covered with shade cloth. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Succession in clearcut conifer plantations proceeds very differently that in nearby native forests.  Data from Puerto Madera indicated that very few native tree species were regenerating in the clearcut, and those six native shrubs (two exotics shrubs were found to be recolonizing also) which were found to be recolonizing the area tended to be tolerant of xeric conditions and typically regenerate in steppe-forest ecotone. All three species fared better at Puerto Madera when they are near shrubs than in the open, which was thought to be a consequence of the microclimatic conditions present in both light and temperature.  At the Pampa Pseudotsuga site the trees fared poorly with the shade treatment, actually declining in height.  This decline was thought to have occurred because of the severe limiting of light through the shade cloth, which limited light to 15% of the normal.  This could have resulted in a diminuation of the plant's photosynthetic capacity.  Cages, on the other hand, were shown to be successful in preventing herbivory.  Native trees suffered considerable herbivory overall on those uncaged plants, however, those located near shrubs were found to be unbrowsed.  The data indicated that the effects of shrub proximity may differ and be more complex than simple shade treatments. The final block of data suggested that restoration treatments will differ from site to site and year to year, suggesting that an effective way of compensating for the vagaries of natural climatic variation may necessitate planting in successive years.  

The other element that the project looked at was the effect of the native Mutisia spinosa vine on reinvasion.  This native vine was hypothesized to heavily colonize conifer seedlings based on early observations of the researchers. Mutisia spinosa is a perennial rhizomatous vine that produces pink daisy-like flowers and small plumed seeds, the leaves are tough, and are resistant to both insect and mammalian herbivory.  At the Puerto Madera site, the vine covered large areas, growing in clumps that appeared to spread both outward and upward.  However, in the course of the two year study there was no conifer mortality.  The vine slowed the growth of the Douglas fir but did not significantly influence the growth of the Ponderosa pine.  The conclusion of the researchers was that the vine had only a mild competitive effect on the conifers. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The experimental results indicated that the clearcuts were stressful environments for native tree seedlings.  The data suggested a continual decline even in the face of shading and caging, although the data also suggested that nurse shrubs and protection from herbivory may both affect regeneration.  The differences among all three tree species indicates that any restoration program must take into account the unique ecology of the species being planted. The dryness of the year in which the experiment took place meant that all the seedlings were exposed to major stress, in greater magnitude than usual.  That indicated that for many tree species the recruitment is episodic and depends on years with particular climatic conditions.  The absence of post-planting care may also account for a change in the effectiveness of the present project. The final condition that might alter future results is that the experiment was conducted in close proximity to one another, which because of dramatic changes in the Patagonian landscape over very short geographic distances indicates that further experimentation will be necessary to clarify who limiting factors vary from site to site.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The biology of invasive species is well-known in the Northern Hemisphere where pines are native to, but in the southern Hemisphere, there are considerably fewer invasive species. The potential exists based on the ecology of pine and fir for the conifers introduced at the turn of the twentieth century to become troublesome species.  Because this invasion is just beginning, the problem is small and localized, presenting a special opportunity to take action and prevent further spread of exotic species.  While there are distinct social and economic incentives for planting pine and fir, there is a complex consideration of the social costs and benefits to the exotic conifers as they have ecological effects far beyond their rapid growth.  The direct success and dispersal of these species may spell trouble for many native species in the Southern hemisphere.  This project sought to expand the available ecological knowledge about the native species that were having difficulty regenerating themselves in those clearcuts left by Argentine national park service activities and in so doing managed to develop community-level understandings that can now guide future restoration efforts.
Because of the early nature of the invasion of pine and fir into these ecosystems, future research is critical to refine the understanding of what factors limit native tree regeneration and to design restoration strategies and practices to promote native species. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-california-steinacher-road-restoration/	USA: California: Steinacher Road Restoration	United States of America	1999-01-01	2002-12-31	"The Karuk Tribe of California and the Six Rivers and Klamath National Forests worked on developing a programmatic approach to watershed restoration in the Karuk Ancestral Territory, an area that encompasses the Mid-Klamath and Salmon River sub-basins. In 1996, the Tribe and the two National Forests entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that established a framework for the two partners to jointly identify, plan, and accomplish mutually beneficial
projects within Karuk Ancestral Territory. The projects identified to benefit both partners are watershed restoration, job training opportunities, and community economic development.Past mining, excessive logging, and road building activities contributed to environmental degradation within the territory. Many sub-basins are listed as sediment, temperature and/or nutrient “impaired” under 303 (d) of the Clean Water Act and classified as “key watersheds””” critical spawning and rearing habitat for endangered or threatened fish species””by the Northwest Forest Plan.The Karuk Tribe, in collaboration with the Northern California Indian Development Council, Inc. (NCIDC), hired a contractor to assist in developing a Karuk Ecosystem Restoration Program, as envisioned by the Director of Natural Resources, Leaf Hillman. The initial effort of the program was to create a watershed division to design, manage and implement watershed
restoration activities on Steinacher Unit, East Ishi-Pishi Unit, and Thompson Unit over a five-year periodFisheries & Aquaculture, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Past mining, grazing, and logging exploits as well as other kinds of land uses and management practices have caused extensive unnatural disturbance in the forest and watershed. Logging disturbances and nearly a century of fire suppression policies have generated landscape conditions that are particularly dangerous with the rise of catastrophic wildfire events. Historic mining techniques, such as hydraulic mining activities directly disturbed over 1200 acres of land in the watershed, while generating an estimated 15 million cubic yards of sediment from 1870 to 1950. To the present day, historic mining continues to impact riparian function and quality as many large tailing piles remain. The damming, diversion and draining activities that were part of the history of mining in and around the Salmon and Klamath river basis left bare slopes and these tailings. Early timber harvesting occurred with both mining and homesteading in the area from the 1870s onward, but commercial harvesting did not begin until the 1950s and by the late 1980s tens of thousands of acres of original forest had been harvested. The replacement of these more open forests with more densely stocked managed plantations has greatly increased the intensity and frequency of fires in the region, and those areas greatly increase the chance that stand replacing fires will reach into adjacent areas. In many lower and mid elevation areas vegetation structure has been altered over the last 50 years in particular because of fire suppression policies, past management activities and wetter climatic conditions that have been the norm for much of this century. Species composition has been changing in many of these areas from the more open stands of conifers and hardwoods to mixed-conifer hardwood overstory, with denser vegetation. The encroachment of shade-tolerant conifers has created a multi-storied stand, while fire-adapted and shade-intolerant species are not regenerating because of increased shading and lack of fire to generate openings. Recently, noxious weeds have begun to be established in disturbed areas further threatening to displace native plant communities. All of this has greatly influenced the overall hydrology of the region’s rivers, impacting the anadromous fish populations through the combination of altered sedimentation, river structure, more catastrophic wildfire, and water diversions. All of these influence the population structure of the fisheries and contribute to the significant declines that have been seen since the mid-1800s when Karuk and Shasta peoples relied on the fish to supply the primary subsistence food. The many modifications of the river’s ecosystem have contributed to the conditions present today that threaten anadromous fish populations further, including the temperature rise that has accompanied the change in vegetation structure, the increased sedimentation, and the alteration of the river’s hydrology. Historically, the forest of this area was much more open than it is today. Reflection on the role of Karuk peoples in the maintenance of the region through the use of fire generally supports a more consistent use of fire to thin out the forest. While denser stands no doubt found on north aspects, in areas of good soil and in drainages, the south aspects were more open with hardwoods. The areas that were most intensely modified generally were located within the canyons adjacent to the rivers. Historical accounts by the Karuk indicate that historically fire was seen as a critical element in the ecosystem The Karuk Ecosystem Restoration Program focuses on two specific objectives: the elimination of old, unneeded roads; and the development of new revenues to provide critically needed watershed restoration.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
In 1979 the Karuk tribe gained sovereign status and began government-to-government protocols with the USDA Forest Service. While tribal participation in Forest Service planning efforts had been limited (advisory only), more recent efforts have been collaborative and the Tribe, the Klamath and Six Rivers National Forests have since entered MOUs that established a framework for both joint identification and planning of mutually beneficial projects and activities. The Karuk Tribe is interested in the long-term employment for Tribal members and the Tribe’s perception is that the budgetary cutbacks in the Forest Sevice, and the reduction of staff that has led to, will not help to restore the region in an acceptable time frame. While a large portion of the affected area is considered tribal lands, there is still significant impact from the Forest Service lands that are managed outside of tribal control.

Description of Project Activities: The start-up phase of the program focused on staff development and implementing the first priority restoration unit, which was the Steinacher Unit.  The Steinacher Road was in the lower segment of the Salmon River sub-basin, specifically affecting the lower portion of Wooley and Steinacher Creeks. These watersheds have been classified as ""key watersheds"" within the Northwest Forest Plan and the top priority for the Tribe.  In 1996, the Klamath National Forest decommissioned the upper 2 miles of the 7.2-mile road. The Karuk Tribes' Watershed Restoration Program decommissioned the remaining 5.2 miles of road during fiscal years 1999, 2001, and 2002 respectively.

Sub-watersheds within the East Ishi Pishi Unit are identified as of ""critical concerns"" and considered ""impaired"" by the Northwest Forest Plan and the Clean Water Act. These watersheds include the Ti, Irving, Rogers and Ukonom Creeks, and contain high potential sources of sediment contributing to the degradation of water quality within the Klamath River system.  Cool water from the sub-watersheds of East Ishi Pishi is important for maintaining water quality in the Klamath River, and provides optimum water temperature for anadromous fish species.  In addition, the lower stream reaches contain spawning and rearing habitat critical to the future viability of these species. Approximately 64 miles of road are identified as candidates for road decommissioning and roughly 8.5 miles are to be converted to trail. The proposed actions will take over 8-12 years to complete depending on funding availability.

Program efforts during the start-up phase focused on training watershed division personnel, implementing the Steinacher Unit, and moving forward in the planning and implementation of East Ishi Pishi and Thompson Units.  In June 1999, a watershed restoration specialists training program was initiated.  Graduates of the basic skills course then interned on the Steinacher Unit and participated on road assessments for Ishi Pishi planning efforts. The training phase was designed to provide the basic knowledge and advanced job skills necessary to accomplish cost-effective, long-term watershed restoration within the Karuk Ancestry Territory. Sixteen Tribal members were hired through the Karuk Community Development Corporation to participate in the Karuk Department of Natural Resources, Watershed Division.  
 
A top-quality watershed restoration-training program is an investment in the Karuk Watershed Division. Training has focused on specific regional restoration objectives and cultural demands; the high quality skills these require will pay off many times over as the program grows in maturity. 
The training curriculum was developed to prepare the Karuk Watershed Division for site management and heavy equipment operations. Students were subjected to rigorous classroom and field study. The curriculum, covered:  
 -  Basic geomorphology and hydrology principles within the regional geologic context; 
 -  Mapping, inventorying and surveying techniques; 
 -  Prescriptions and treatment layout; 
 -  Heavy equipment operations and labor-intensive application;  
 -  Unit management, record keeping and monitoring methods; 
 -  Communications, safety, CPR and first aid.

Initial training began with formal classroom and on-the-ground training modules that covered step-by-step operations in the following areas: program management, site management, heavy equipment operations, labor-intensive operations, and native plant operations.  The internship phase provided on-the-job apprenticeships for watershed restoration specialists after completing the basic core curriculum. Internships reinforce the consistency and quality taught in initial training, and continues until a sufficient knowledge base is acquired.

Steinacher Road was the only road within the Steinacher Creek watershed. Planned to be the primary transportation route to cut timber and haul logs from the Salmon River basin to mills in Happy Camp, road construction began in 1968. However, only 7.2 miles of it was completed due to the creation of Marble Mountain Wilderness. Construction of the road was complex: topography, incompetent soils, and bedrock presented engineering difficulties in maintaining a 26-foot roadbed with a uniform grade. In 1997, the Klamath National Forest decommissioned the upper 2 miles of the 7.2-mile road.  In 1997, the Karuk Tribe contracted with Pacific Watershed Associates (PWA) to prepare a technical specifications report for decommissioning the remaining 5.2 miles of Steinacher Road. This report estimated 172,265 yd3 of fill material to be excavated from 23 treatment sites over a three-year, heavy equipment work schedule at an estimated cost of $2.2 million. By 1999, planning efforts were underway to include Steinacher Road in the program. The Karuk Tribe then contracted with TerraWave Systems Inc. to assist in the development of the Tribe's Watershed Restoration Division and implement the road decommissioning as part of the training and internship phase. During the road decommissioning survey-training component, a critical treatment volume disparity surfaced between the two contractors estimates. 
 
These differences were great enough to require revision of the treatment specifications, which increased the final excavation volume by 23,791 yd3.  Technical changes were required to be made before heavy equipment began, which significantly impacted the work schedule and logistics. By the end of FY99, the first field season of heavy equipment operations excavated approximately 52,000 cubic yards of fill were removed and placed in stable locations, and winter maintenance measures were implemented.  From August to November 2000 (FY 2000), the Karuk Program resurveyed the rest of the road, and implemented winter maintenance measures, no additional excavation work occurred due to inadequate revenue.  During FY 2001, approximately 48,823 cubic yards of fill material was excavated and placed in a stable location.  The final phase of the Steinacher Project completed in FY 2002 removed and placed in appropriate locations approximately 117,853 cubic yards of fill material.  The graph below compares cost to cubic yardage.  Overall, for the entire project the cost per cubic yard is calculated to be $11.52. The revised treatment specifications detail the work schedule by itemizing: excavation and disposal sites, secondary erosion control measures, labor-intensive work, winterization measures, monitoring, and other special conditions or concerns. 
 
The treatment specifications require the removal of road fill from stream crossings, swales, and unstable sidecast areas that threaten waterways and downstream salmonid habitat. Stream crossings are to be excavated to original width, depth, and slope to expose natural channel armor and buried topsoil or achieve stable engineered dimensions for maximum cost-effectiveness. Sidecast fill material, with high failure potentials affecting watercourses, is to be excavated to reduce erosion hazard and expose buried topsoil. Excavated material is to be moved to stable road locations, placed along cutbanks and in throughcuts, and then shaped to specific slope and compaction requirements.  
 
Treatment specifications were designed with tentative grades and dimensions, which provide the basis for estimates of volumes to be excavated. As the work progressed, the site supervisor (who monitors the excavation) determines the final grades and dimensions. The final grades and dimensions provide the basis for determining actual volumes excavated. While monitoring the excavations, the site supervisor instructs the equipment operators to adjust the excavation's grade, alignment, and bank dimensions to preserve latent boundary conditions, such as: original topsoil, natural channel armor, bedrock outcrops, or stumps in the growth position. (It is extremely important not to remove or disturb these natural boundary features.) Decommissioning the 5.2 miles of Steinacher Road required three heavy equipment work seasons. Work generally started nearest the end of the road and proceeded backward to the beginning of the road. However, due to the large volume of end-hauled material from crossings 9 and 10, the work schedule incorporated complex end-hauling operations to manage the interspersed disposal sites. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: On July 13, 1999, the Steinacher Road heavy equipment phase began and continued through October 15 of that year. Six large pieces of heavy equipment and up to nine dump trucks were used to execute the earthwork. Large bulldozers, excavators, dump trucks, a water truck, and for a brief time, a grader were all used on the project. Interns from the Karuk Training Program 
operated the heavy equipment. Trucks and their operators were provided through a local subcontractor. No heavy equipment work except winterization measures occurred in FY 2000 due to lack of funding.  During this period rolling dips and straw bale check dams were installed.  Treatment revisions were also accomplished during this time. The field season for 2001 ran from June 18 through September 21.  The occurrence of a summer storm stopped work from June 27 through June 29.  In addition no work occurred July 4 through July 6.  Due to funding limitations heavy equipment operations were limited to four ten-hour days.   
 
The third and final phase began June 19, 2002 with the staging of post project erosion and sediment control material (weed-free rice straw) and revegetation supplies (native grass seed and fertilizer).  Also during this time frame heavy equipment mobilization occurred.  This was the first year the Tribe has taken on the responsibility of heavy equipment rental.  Heavy equipment operations started on June 24 and continued until November 1.  The Final Phase work schedule was the most demanding to date.  The crews and heavy equipment maintained five-ten hour days throughout the length of the project.  The only day operations ceased was July 4.  To keep up with the decommissioning, Watershed Restoration Laborers classification was created and tribal members hired, to implement erosion and sediment control measures as the project progressed. Treatment specification plans provide prescriptions for each road segment and detail the work to be performed, providing volume estimates, road dimensions, culvert sizes and lengths, disposal locations, and special instructions that are included in the prescriptions. 
 
Several types of treatments are required for Steinacher Road.  The road alignment may traverse a hillslope, cross a stream channel, or cut through a ridge. The reach may contain ditches, berms, seeps, or springs. The road grade and surface composition may differ from one reach to another, just as the stability of fills and cutbanks may differ. Some road reach treatments require both excavation and disposal prescriptions. This is determined by the original construction design of a particular reach. Road reaches are delineated between major stream crossings and require specific treatments, depending on the road stability and original construction design.  Excavated fill goes to disposal sites. Disposal sites serve two functions: to provide stable, long-term storage for imported fill; and to buttress cutbank instability. Disposal site volumes are defined by road prism cross-section surveys and treatment length. Natural conditions may cause actual disposal site volumes to vary from designed volumes by minute variations in cutbank shape or changes in the finished grade.  The fill material is shaped and compacted to specifications. All fill is placed against cutbanks so that a seam is not created between the cutbank and fill in a manner that prevents concentration,  containment, or diversion of surface run off. The finished grade must be a free-draining surface. Except for designated locations, all finished grades on Steinacher Road were at 40 percent slope.  
 
Stream crossing excavations (RX). Stream crossing excavations involved the removal and disposal of the road fill and culverts from a stream channel, and shaping the excavation to blend with the surrounding terrain. Salvaged culverts were transported off site to Karuk property for storage and subsequent recycling. The completed excavation mimics the original pre-road construction stream channel and side bank configuration. The technical specifications for each crossing treatment are described and include information on: total expected excavated volume; channel gradient, length and bottom width; average side bank slope; and maximum depth. The estimated volumes were calculated from defining an upper and lower excavation point in each channel and taking several cross-sections perpendicular to the channel across the road prism at important locations. This data was then entered into Redwood National Park's roads software program (WinRoad). Volume estimate accuracy is subject to site conditions and the number of cross-sections taken.  Surveys are benchmarked to allow for important pre- and post-excavation volume calculations and channel adjustment monitoring.  Several stream crossing excavations are double crossings, meaning the crossing was built on the confluence of two streams. In other stream crossings, the channel curves. In both of these situations, volume estimates are less accurate. Experienced site supervision is critical in these situations.  Stream crossing treatments occur in perennial and intermittent stream channels and through-fill locations. 
 
Spring Drain (SD). A spring drain treatment is a mini-crossing excavation. The primary purpose of the treatment is to allow for water from springs emerging from the road cutbank or roadway and to follow the natural hillslope fall line. Usually the base-of-cut is the same depth as adjacent treatments, and the top-of-cut is the in-board edge of road. No fill is stored on or above the spring, and the finished channel grade does not exceed 40 percent. 
 
Exported Outslope (EOS). An exported outslope treatment can either remove the entire road prism width or only the outboard portion of the prism.  In both cases, some or the entire excavated fill cannot remain local and must be moved some distance to a stable disposal site.  The estimated excavation volume exceeds that of the local disposal volume. EOS prescriptions commonly occur in topographic swales or ephemeral streams where the risk of debris landslides is great. Any fill that is placed locally is shaped according to specifications. In the situation of partial excavation, the remaining road bench is a free draining surface, minimally graded to a 5-percent outslope. The average finished EOS grade does not exceed 50 percent slope. 
 
Straight Outslope (OS). An outslope treatment excavates fill material from the outer edge of the road or landing; however, there are no landings on Steinacher Road.  The material is placed directly against the adjacent local cutbank and shaped to according to specifications. Commonly, OS prescriptions occur in balanced cut/fill road locations where the fill slope grade exceeds the stable angle of repose of the material, and the risk of failure (causing impacts to waterways) is high. The finished OS grades do not exceed 40 percent, per specification, and excavation volume is defined by surveys.  There were ultimately few OS treatments on Steinacher Road. 
 
Fill Outslope (FOS.) A fill outslope treatment is prescribed at locations where a side-cast excavation is required and the volume of excavated fill material is less than the volume of maximum local storage. The unstable road edge can be pulled back and there is room for importing and disposing fill from other excavations treatments. A majority of the road bench can be used for disposal storage. The cut and fill area is defined by cross-section surveys. Fill is placed against the cutbank and graded from the fill-to-here mark to the catch-point and excavated from the cut-to-here flag to the top-of-cut mark. The two grades may not be the same. 

Disposal Outslope (DOS). A disposal outslope treatment occurs on full bench-cut road segment where in-situ regolith (stable native ground) is present at the out-board edge of road. The road prism is bedrock or native soils, with no side-cast materials. The entire road bench can be used for storage. Fill is placed against the cutbank and graded from the fill-to-here mark on the cutbank to zero at a defined catch-point, commonly the outboard edge of road. 
 
Straight Disposal (DS). Straight disposal treatments occur at through-cut locations or large topographic flats.  In through-cut locations, DS treatments are flanked by and blend with disposal outslope (DOS) treatments and/or taper to fill outslope (FOS) treatments. Fill is graded to the top of both cut banks and compacted to specifications. The entire through-cut can be filled with imported material. The finished grade is less than 50 percent slope. Because through-cuts often cut spur ridges, the finished grade averages 20 percent slope, and the 50-percent slope is the transition to other treatments. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Decommissioning Steinacher Road presented more technical challenges than usual. Although project managers estimated a net disposal site volume surplus of 32,863 yd3 over the length of the entire project,  the actual excavation/storage volume difference is less than 6 percent after factoring for material expansion and compaction coefficients. Because fill material is imported into a disposal reach from both end-hauled sources (end-hauling is loading fill into dump trucks) and adjacent excavation sources, experienced supervision is essential to achieve cost-efficiency and accurate volume capacity. Steinacher Road traversed steep, erosive, mountainous terrain. Variations in fill material and ground conditions add to decommissioning complexity. The majority of fill material was composed of uniform, very coarse-grained rock fragments typical of a grus regolith, commonly known as decomposed granite (DG), with occasional concentrations of small rocks and boulders. The moisture content of the fill material varied from dry to completely saturated. Ground conditions changed frequently, with variable road width, cut bank height, hillslope repose, crossing orientation, channel flow, and bedrock competency. Fifteen stream crossing excavation sites contained more than 2,500 yd3 of fill. Seven of those sites contained more than 10,000 yd3 and two sites contained more than 19,000 yd3. The largest excavation is estimated at 67,828yd3 at RX10 (CP155+80), halfway through the project.  Two crossings (RX 9 and RX 10) have fill volumes that exceeded nearby disposal site capacity by 86 percent. Nearly 75,000 yd3 from these two crossings were trucked to distant disposal sites along the length of the road. Careful supervision of end-hauling material was required to balance locally derived excavated fill with fill from distant areas, while at the same time maximizing disposal site volume.    
 
Stream crossing excavations were further complicated and consequently time-consuming due to their size and geometry. For example, many crossing excavations have asymmetric geometry, in which the natural channel is oblique to the road alignment and/or natural channel beds curve through crossings. Some channels had culverts with buried elbow joints, while other channels had culverts not set to natural grade. Many pipes carry flowing water year round, required additional water quality measures during excavation.  Three crossing excavations were considered double crossings, in which the design geometry and final shape must take into account the crossing being built on the confluence of two stream channels. These excavations were very complex and complicated operations.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The Steinacher road restoration was one of the largest road decommissioning projects in the Pacific Northwest to date. The project was seen as critical for maintaining viable fish populations in Wooley Creek watershed, and it contributed greated to the local economy through the training and eduction of tribal members in watershed restoration techniques.  The creation of a central corps of trained individuals in the community dedicated to watershed restoration raised the overall viability of continuing this type of work over the long-term.  The significant levels of unemployment and poverty among the Karuk were significantly lessened by the project and developed the viability of a restoration economy that has not only immediate income generating consequences but also long-term ecological benefits in the form of watershed restoration.
The central concern in the long-term management of these projects is not will. These communities have deep historical and personal connections to their land. Instead, it remains a critical problem to finance these restorations due to the lack of tribal revenue. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-washington-olympia-oyster-restoration-project/	USA: Washington: Olympia Oyster Restoration Project	United States of America	1999-01-01	2008-07-15	"The Olympia oyster, the Pacific Northwest coast’s only native oyster, ranges from southeastern Alaska to Baja, California. For thousands of years, Olympia oysters provided sustenance for tribes and habitat for a host of marine organisms. Until the late 1800s, Olympia oysters were the most abundant bivalves in Puget Sound, where they occupied thousands of acres of productive, diverse habitat. Over-harvesting, sediment loads, and pollution drove the oyster to near extinction. Today, it occupies a fraction of its former range and is a Candidate Threatened Species in Washington State and a priority species for restoration.Since 1999, the Olympia Oyster Restoration Project has brought together more than 100 partners from the seafood industry, Indian tribes, state agencies, the U.S. Navy, local environmental organizations, schools, and property owners to: 1) identify appropriate habitats for oyster restoration, 2) modify substrate for growing oysters by adding old oyster shells, 3) propagate and seed oyster spat, and 4) monitor results.Fisheries & Aquaculture, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry, Other For thousands of years, human communities capitalized on Puget Sound’s native oysters. Particularly in the south Sound, native tribes often sited their villages near large beds of Olympia oysters. Members of what is now known as the Squaxin Island Tribe recall the often densely concentrated shellfish as something akin to their “daily bread” “” there for the taking any time the tide was out. The first European settlers to the area gathered Olympia oysters from wild populations, primarily for sustenance and perhaps for local sale. In the 1850s, northern California’s gold prospectors brought their appetites for oysters with them from the East Coast and often celebrated large strikes with enormous quantities of oysters and champagne. A plate of native oysters sold for as much as $20 “” the equivalent of about $400 today. Overharvesting, pollution and sedimentation took their tolls on San Francisco Bay’s oyster stocks, forcing seafood sellers to turn to Willapa Bay in the Washington Territory for relief. Merchants shipped Willapa Bay native oysters to San Francisco as fast as they could be harvested. As the oysters were shipped in their shells, however, the hard substrate necessary for larval settlement gradually disappeared. Overharvesting and the steady reduction of settling habitat spelled disaster. By the 1870s, Willapa’s oyster stocks had been exhausted. Olympia oysters in Puget Sound were initially spared the burden of overharvest, largely because oysters shipped by sea to San Francisco would spoil before they reached the city. Harvest was thus highly localized, and few instances of overharvest occurred before Washington’s statehood in 1889. At that point, titles to all tidelands passed to the State of Washington. Six years later, state legislators passed laws allowing the sale of oyster beds to individuals already occupying adjacent land or cultivating natural oyster beds. Washington’s oyster farmers would soon discover diking, a method that eventually encompassed more than a thousand acres of tidelands. Oyster dikes “” first made of logs and later built from concrete “” took advantage of the native oyster’s tendency to settle and thrive in areas consistently under water. At a time when natural beds of native oysters were beginning to be depleted, dikes offered a means by which growers could greatly expand available acreage for shellfish farming. Yields in the first years of Olympia oyster harvest in Puget Sound may have been as high as 100,000 bushels annually, but had dropped by 1910 to a mere 29,000 bushels. Over the next 15 years “” a period of extensive diking “” production once again increased to as many as 40,000 bushels per year. A low point in Olympia oyster production occurred soon after 1927, the year that a sulfite pulp mill began operating in Shelton and discharging untreated sulphite waste liquor (SWL) into Oakland Bay. SWL is highly toxic and affected private and commercial oyster beds almost immediately, preventing oyster larvae from setting and killing most adult oysters. A series of experiments in the 1930s, 40s and 50s demonstrated that polluted wastewater from the mill circulated throughout southern Puget Sound. Other experiments established that SWL concentrations as low as eight parts per million were deleterious to oysters. By 1957, the year the pulp mill permanently closed, most Olympia oyster growers in southern Puget Sound had already switched over to cultivating the non-native Pacific oyster. Despite subsequent water quality improvements, the damage to native oyster stocks had been done. By 1960, overharvesting had nearly exterminated native oyster beds in Willapa and Samish bays, and pollution had wiped out most of south Puget Sound’s once-thriving Olympia oyster populations. Olympia oysters have survived in north and central Puget Sound, and populations in the south Sound and Hood Canal are, by some accounts, gradually recovering. Water quality has generally improved over the past 40 years, and strict regulations have alleviated harvest pressure on remaining wild oyster populations. Nonetheless, more than 150 years of habitat modification have taken their toll. Continued development around shorelines introduces silt to the ecosystem and the construction of bulkheads and dikes can scour beaches, damaging Olympia oyster beds that have only recently begun to recover. Characteristics of suitable intertidal habitat for Olympia oysters include: Firm substrate “” composite areas of sand, mud, shell material and rock. Olympia oysters are prone to sinking when placed on soft substrate. Few predators “” For peak productivity, sites must be fairly free of oyster drills, sea stars, moon snails and other natural enemies of oysters. It should be noted that dense Olympia oyster populations are occasionally found co-occurring with dense populations of drills and other predators, suggesting the oysters may withstand intense predation pressure under some conditions. High degree of protection “” Estuaries, coves and bays may shelter Olympia oysters from movement and potential damage by currents and wave action. Consistent sources of water “” Unlike Pacific oysters, which can withstand periodic exposure at low tides, Olympia oysters are vulnerable to high and low temperatures if not covered by water. Freshwater influences “” Olympia oysters thrive in the brackish waters found near estuaries, stream outlets and the heads of bays. Olympia oysters have remarkable capacities to persist in suitable habitats throughout Puget Sound and Hood Canal. During spring and summer months, shellfish biologists from WDFW and partners in oyster reestablishment annually survey beaches thought to have extant populations of Olympia oysters. They often find evidence that Olympia oyster populations are maintaining themselves “” and, in some instances, thriving “” at locales from Budd Inlet to the northern San Juan Islands. The decline of Olympia Oysters throughout the Puget Sound region was of concern to policymakers when the 1998 Stock Rebuilding Plan was initiated under the authority of the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW). The concern from the outset was that the oyster population was threatened to the point of requiring listing as a threatened species. The Puget Sound Restoration Fund became involved in the project in 1999.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
By 1998 the Olympia oyster was a candidate for review as a possible state threatened, endangered or sensitive species, due to concern over low population levels. In that year, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) developed the Olympia Oyster Stock Rebuilding Plan. Since that time, on-the-ground reestablishment efforts spearheaded by the Puget Sound Restoration Fund (PSRF) have greatly assisted the Olympia oyster’s return. PSRF has assisted in spreading over five million oysters at more than 80 experimental sites, with assistance from over 100 project partners.

Description of Project Activities: The first step in the process was to find intertidal areas with extant native oyster populations or those containing evidence of existing populations in the past, such as historic mounds of oyster shells that indicate prior shellfish abundance.  Once these sites were located, a supply of juvenile Olympia oysters with which to seed the site was necessary.  Seed oysters were acquired from a hatchery or by capitalizing on natural spawning and settling by wild stock.  In order to preserve the genetic integrity of Olympia oyster populations, WDFW encouraged restorationists to draw from those populations that originated in the same management area in which the offspring would be spread.  Uncertainty over whether the remaining oyster populations are form one population, or from a number of sub-populations necessitated the guidelines.  Once a source for broodstock, or mature Olympia oysters is decided upon, a WDFW permit for collection was obatained. Next, the populations must be tested for shellfish-borne diseases because of concern over the spread of shellfish diseases through conservation efforts.  Once certified that the broodstock are clear of infection the oysters were delivered to shellfish hatcheries in order to be conditioned for spawning readiness, which requires approximately one week in 55-to 61- degree F water.  Once the oysters are spawned, the cultured larvae (or spat) are concentrated in small tanks where they settle on suitable substrate, often bits of Pacific oyster shell.  This clutched larvae is bagged for shipping with as many as 6,000 Olympia oysters per bag, or they are kept at the hatchery and fed phytoplankton-rich water fro several months. Once the oysters reach the size of a pencil eraser, usually within three months of settling, the seed oysters are again tested by a pathologist before begin planted on the beach.  Strict standards and permits are required by the WDFW to transfer, transport, and transplant oysters from one population to another.  These clutched oysters are highly susceptible to exposure to air and require delicate care and careful planning for transport and seeding.  This often is accomplished by layering damp blankets and tarps over bags of clutch in the back of an open-air pickup.  

Once at the site, several seeding methods are used.  Which method depends on a range of factors, including potential predation, size of seed, degree of exposure and substrate conditions.  Traditional bottom culture involves scattering clutch across areas of suitable habitat without much concern for crowding, these bottom culture sites are best when there are few known predators and sufficiently firm substrate.  In marginal habitat, or when seed is especially vulnerable to predation, seed can be left in mesh bags from the hatchery or transferred to rectangular, 1/8"" to Â¼"" mesh grow out bags.  This method requires that the shells be removed from the bags and spread by bottom culture after three or four months in the water.  If this method is used, some care is necessary to give the oysters better odds to reach spawning age. Heavy currents, wave action, or other effects of beach exposure requires that tideland owners stake the grow-out bags to the beach with rebar or other material. Additionally, the bags must be periodically flipped to minimize siltation and potentially smothering the oysters on the bottom of the bags.  

Another element of the effort is to locate specific habitat that conforms to specific criteria for native oysters and provide habitat enhancement. A variety of assessments are made to determine whether a particular location is a good candidate for consideration.  The habitat enhancement treatment then is ideally employed as a stock-rebuilding technique in areas where structure is limited, but where recruitment potential, community structure and habitat requirements for native oysters exist.  Without some form of complex structure on a tideland that lies exposed above beach sediments, native oyster larvae in the water column choose to move on.  A habitat enhancement treatment provides the area with an emergent oyster setting structure to catalyze natural recruitment.  Over time, these enhancements have proven effective by significantly increasing local native oyster stocks and are restoring viable populations at several locations in Puget Sound. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Approximately 5 million oysters have been planted at 80 experimental sites throughout Puget Sound.  In 2007 alone, this work involved nearly 4 acres of tidelands directly seeded to Olympia oyster, workshops to promote continued restoration up and down the West coast, and habitat enhancement efforts throughout Puget Sound. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The location of suitable habitat is critical.  Although numerous techniques can be employed to grow the oysters to maturing, from suspending them in bags form docks or other floating structures, to the use of longline cultural techniques (where lengths of rope is attached to small posts, with clutched shell or spat on the longline itself), all of these techniques require periodic maintenance. This effort also relies on many private landholders, as many tidal lands are privately held.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The Olympia oyster was a significant element of the Puget Sound foodshed for thousands of years.  The restoration of the Olympia oyster also serves as a lightning rod for other projects, from clean water work to watershed improvement to the elimination of pollutants from the waterways that feed into Puget Sound.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/czech-republic-species-rich-grassland-restoration-white-carpathians-protected-area/	Czech Republic: Species-rich Grassland Restoration, White Carpathians Protected Area	Czech Republic	1993-01-01	2004-12-31	"Species rich semi-natural grasslands are an important but threatened habitat throughout Europe and much of the former area has been lost since the 1950s. However, in some countries large areas have been preserved and the demand for meadow recreation by sowing seed mixtures is increasing. In the White Carpathians Protected Landscape Area (Czech Republic) the use of commercial seed mixtures is undesirable and the use of regional mixtures has been investigated. The costs for seeding large areas are high and lower cost techniques are needed. In 1999 a ï¬eld experiment was set up to investigate the restoration of hay meadow vegetation comparing the sowing of a regional mixture all over a plot with sowing narrow 2.5 m strips of regional seed mixtures into a matrix of a commercial grass mixture or into natural regeneration. The results after ï¬ve seasons showed good establishment of the sown species in the meadow treatment. Spread of sown species from the sown strips into the surrounding matrix occurred but the cover of species was lower in the commercial grass matrix compared with the natural regeneration matrix. Colonization of some plots by unsown desirable grassland species from adjacent grassland habitats also occurred, but more species colonized the natural regeneration matrix than the commercial grasses or the sown meadow matrix itself. Overall, the results indicate that, in appropriate situations, sown strips can provide a lower cost but slower and longer-term alternative to ï¬eld scale sowing of regional seed mixtures for restoration of hay meadow vegetation.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation In the Czech Republic grasslands occupy about 800,000 ha, which since 1950 has declined by almost a third of the total historical grassland area because of agricultural intensification and abandonment. In the beginning of the 20th century the White Carpathian meadows covered a much larger area than today. In the second half of the 20th century, many of the meadows were destroyed, not only my plowing or excessive fertilization, but also by lack of management and abandonment. Particularly hilly parts with uneven terrain were hard to mow with common agricultural equipment and therefore were abandoned. Subsequently, hawthorn scrub encroached on these lands and since the Velvet Revolution of 1989 hundreds of hectares of arable land have been regrassed. Overall, there are 4000 ha of hay meadows in the White Carpathian Mountains. The project site was part of the flower-rich meadow complex prior to the 1970s, but from 1970-1998 the field was plowed and sown with arable crops. These species rich semi-natural grasslands are an important but threatened habitat throughout Europe. These meadows are rich in wildflowers with up to 103 vascular plant species per 24 sq meters. The richness comes from a history of low intensity management and being situated biogeographically between the Subatlantic, Montane Carpathian, and Pannonian regions. At the regional scale, a primary conservation objective is to prevent further losses of flower-rich hay meadows, to maintain the existing meadows in favorable condition and where possible to extend their current area through restoration on suitable arable land. The restoration of grassland biotopes can help reverse habitat losses elsewhere. However, there are constraints for successful restoration on ex-arable soils such as residual soil fertility that may reduce the survival of target species due to competition from grasses. Also, even if soils are deemed suitable the lack of propagules of desirable species in the seed bank and seed rain results in very few target species that establish by natural regeneration. The overall objective of the study was to assess the feasibility of different restoration techniques, comparing higher cost regional seed mixtures with low cost natural regeneration and intermediate methods using sown strips in a commercial grass mixture or in a natural regeneration matrix to provide information about the improvement of regional conservation strategies.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Conservation of these flower-rich hay meadows at a European level happens because of the Habitats Directive, which identifies orchid rich traditional hay meadows as a priority for conservation. The extent of area annually sown depends on subsidies from the ministries of the environment and agriculture under EU agri-environmental schemes, mainly because meadow management is unprofitable and hay production exceeds demand.

Description of Project Activities: Before the establishment of the plots, from 1993 to 1995, the selection and preparation of a suitable native regional hay meadow seed mixture corresponding to the reference hay meadow vegetation of the study area was carried out. The target community is the Bromion erecti alliance of the Festuco-Brometea. Typical species include: Festuca rupicola, Bromus erectus, Briza media, Koeleria pyramidata, Molinia arundinacea, Carex montana, Asperula tinctoria, Astragalus danicus, Cirsium pannonicum, Crepis praemorsa, Filipendula vulgaris, Helianthemum nummularium, Hypochoeris maculata, Inula salicina, Iris graminea, Knautia kitaibelii, Lathyrus latifolius, Melampyrum cristatum, Orobanche lutea, Peucedanum cervaria, Polygala major, Potentilla alba, Primula veris, Prunella grandiï¬‚ora, Pulmonaria angustifolia, Scorzonera hispanica, Serratula tinctoria, Thesium linophyllon, Trifolium alpestre, Trifolium montanum, Trifolium rubens, Veronica teucrium, and the orchids Anacamptis pyramidalis, Gymnadenia conopsea, Orchis mascula, Orchis militaris, Orchis ustulata, Ophrys fuciï¬‚ora subsp. holubyana, Platanthera bifolia and Traunsteinera globosa. Seed of about 100 of the most frequent White Carpathian grassland species was collected and cultivated in nursery beds. For this project, 7 grass species and 20 herb species (including 3 legumes) were sown. Seeds of these species were harvested in 1998, at times determined by seed ripeness. The experiment was set up in 1999 in a 3 ha arable ï¬eld. The experiment was a randomized block design with four treatments (1 - 4) each replicated four times (A - D) in plots each measuring 55 m x 20 m. The plots were sown in spring 1999 after the ï¬eld had been ploughed in autumn 1998 and harrowed twice (to reduce weeds) in spring 1999. Four establishment treatments were applied: (1) RSM: Regional seed mixture sown at a seed rate of 2 g/sqm over the whole plot, 
(2) RCG: Regional seed mixture sown at a seed rate of 2 g/sqmô°Šon the 2.5 m wide central strip with lateral strips sown with a matrix of a commercial grass seed mix at a seed rate of 2 g/sqm, (3) RNR: Regional seed mixture sown at a seed rate of 2 g/sqm on the 2.5 m wide central strip with lateral strips left for a matrix of vegetation to develop from natural regeneration, and (4) NR: Natural regeneration over the whole plot.The management of the experimental area included annual mowing in July or August and subsequent removal of hay. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The majority of sown grass and herb species showed good establishment and persistence over the duration of the experiment. Only one species failed to establish altogether (Helianthemum nummularium) probably due to poor seed quality. Unsurprisingly, the most effective treatment for establishing hay meadow vegetation is the RSM treatment where the regional seed mixture was sown over the whole plot. More importantly, results for the RCG and RNR treatments, where the regional seed mixture was sown in 2.5 m wide strips in a matrix of commercial grasses or natural regeneration, provide information on spread of species from a sown area into a surrounding matrix. All of the sown grass species were recorded colonising the matrix of the RCG or the RNR treatments although some of them at low frequency (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Briza media and Koeleria macrantha). These general results for the grasses are in agreement with other studies which show effective establishment, persistence and spread amongst a wide range of grass species. For the regional herb species the situation is somewhat different. On the basis of ï¬ve years results most of these herb species showed less potential to spread from the sown strips into natural regeneration or commercial grass matrix than the regional grass species. Herbs appear to be slower to develop effective dispersal than grasses and this lower dispersal capability is one of the major constraints to species-rich grassland recreation by natural regeneration on arable land. These general results are consistent with the conclusion others who suggest that grasses consistently out-perform herbs in many grassland restoration experiments. Nonetheless, most of the regional herb species showed some potential to spread from the sown strips, but apart from Centaurea jacea, Leontodon hispidus, Plantago lanceolata, Prunella laciniata and Prunella vulgaris, these species had colonised the matrix of the different treatments only patchily by 2004. Only ï¬ve of the regional herb species that established in the sown strips were absent from the quadrats in the matrix of the RCG or RNR treatments; Betonica ofï¬cinalis, Cirsium pannonicum, Hypericum perforatum, Leucanthemum vulgare and Salvia verticillata. The result for Leucanthemum contrasts with the results of other studies where Leucanthemum is one of the best establishing species, although sometimes showing poor persistence and variable spread. The explanation for the poor performance of Leucanthemum in this experiment is uncertain, it could reï¬‚ect poor seed viability, although the same batch of seed showed good establishment in another area sown in 2000. The general ï¬nding for herbs, however, is in accord with other studies that show herbs to persist well when they do establish, but to be more variable in their establishment and spread than grasses. Colonization by both regional grasses and regional herbs was more successful into the natural regeneration matrix than into the commercial grasses. This result is expected; competition of commercial grass species such as Festuca rubra and Arrhenatherum elatius can be expected to reduce establishment success of at least some herb species from seed.  Pywell et al. (2002), in a multi-site ï¬eld experiment, compared diversiï¬cation of a species-poor grass dominated seed mixture compared with natural regeneration. They concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that sowing a species-poor grass-dominated seed mixture made the vegetation any less susceptible to colonization by desirable species compared with natural regeneration. However, close inspection of their data indicates an increasing trend for species richness in the natural regeneration compared with decreasing trend in the grass dominated mix, suggesting that the sown grass matrix does reduce the potential for diversiï¬cation compared with natural regeneration. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The landscape context of restoration sites is an important element in determining the success or failure of grassland restoration, especially in terms of long-term sustainability.  Careful targeting of sites in relation to existing fragments of species-rich grassland is an important element in restoration planning at the regional level. For this project the site was bounded by forest on one side, arable crops on two others and the fourth side was an orchard with Bromion grassland containing some hay meadow species.  The area also had a large area of species-rich grassland only .3 km downhill and 1 km over the hilltop.  The movement of animals such as deer regularly occurs between the meadows and woodland, facilitating the movement of species through animal and wind dispersal.  Most of the colonization that occurred in this project is thought to have happened this way because meadow species in this ecosystem do not persist in the seed bank as their seeds lose viability within a few years.  Mowing, while beneficial in some respects was found to provide the poorest conditions for colonization by these desirable unsown grassland species, and the inhibitory effect could be a negative factor preventing diversification of the sown vegetation in areas adjacent to existing meadows.  Additionally, mowing was the most expensive treatment but has the potential to produce good saleable meadow hay from the second year which could be an added financial incentive for the farmer to adopt this method of restoration.  The cost of wildflower seed is expensive and while it is seen as the most rapid means to restoration of these grasslands, the practice of sowing the regional seed mixture in a strip is the most cost effective treatment.  While the speed of colonization is considerably slower and requires mowing and adjacent seed sources to succeed, the extra mowing and the poor quality of the hay are of little value and high cost to the landowner.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Restoration methods all have advantages and disadvantages, there are always alternative strategies which may be able to optimize short-term establishment of a restricted range of desirable characteristics with the prospect for longer-term diversification.  The results of this particular project suggest that a regional seed mix sown over the entire area can quickly achieve a grassland sward acceptable in species richness and agricultural terms.  However, it is an expensive option.   Alternatives for achieving similar results are sowing strips of seed, but this method is much longer term and has less beneficial hay resultant.
The best method for establishing species rich meadow vegetation was the RSM treatment with good establishment and persistence of sown regional grass and herb species. The rapidly established meadow sward prevented weed problems and even resisted colonization by more competitive species. Mowing once a year was sufficient to maintain the sward, with an added beneficial influence on seed dispersal enhanced by the mowing machine. Lower sowing rates are an alternative prospect for successfully establishing desired vegetation, and lower seeding rates allow for the restoration of larger areas. A further alternative to seed sowing is hay strewing, which has shown great promise at creating a sward similar to the original grassland and can be an effective and cost-effective method for the restoration of species-rich vegetation.

Most of the land was abandoned as water tables and prices dropped, resulting in abandoned agricultural fields that have few or no plants growing on them at all. There is little interest in restoring the lowland desertscrub native to this part of the Sonoran Desert because it is little known and uncharismatic. Much of the land is dominated by the short-lived shrub burrowweed (Isocoma tenuisecta). The low rainfall of only 25 cm/year on average suggests that the prognosis for natural succession is slim. Earlier studies found that reestablishment of the dominant saltbush and creosotebush were highly variable, with some fields having no plant cover. Most of the old fields have annuals and short-lived perennials persisting, but still have few long-lived shrubs. Lowland Sonoran desertscrub has little in the way of ecosystem services, has little grazing potential, and as such has less incentive to restore these ecosystems. Agricultural and urban development in southern Arizona has considerably reduced the land cover in this type of ecosystem, so restoration was seen as a means to expand the area of this unique desert ecosystem. Restored saltbush desertscrub would benefit groundwater recharge, less flood damage to county roads, reduction in dust, and would be an increase of wildlife habitat. The project sought to determine historic species composition for a given site, acquiring seeds of those species, introduce them to the site, and provide them with extra water for establishment.Agriculture & Livestock Historical aerial photos taken between 1936 to 1979 combined with soils and remnant vegetation found in small patches throughout the study area provided a portrait of an ecosystem highly disturbed by agricultural development and groundwater pumping. Farming operations started in the 1930s, but were small at that time. In the late 1930s the arrival of greater pumping facilitated significant groundwater mining in the area and set the stage for massive exploitation. The spread of industrial agricultural techniques and the rapid rise of massive farming enterprises contributed to the massive boom that started in the early 1950s, with agricultural efforts focused squarely on cotton production. The area of the project saw an explosive growth in acreage under cultivation from 1949 to 1954 when cotton prices collapsed. The short-lived history of farming on the study site had come to an end by the 1970s. The study site was near Toltec, Arizona in a one square mile section. The area was considered to be representative of the Santa Cruz floodplain, an ephemeral stream in the area that flows from south to north. The researchers found fragments of ironwood (Olneya tesota) and blue palo verde (Parkinsonia floridum) that indicated greater water availability in the past. The ecosystem is largely composed of creosote and saltbush flats. Given the radical alteration of the ecosystem from pre-settlement conditions due in large part to the dewatering of the landscape it is difficult to assess the precise condition of the pre-disturbance ecosystem. Both the Gila and Santa Cruz rivers were known to have more regular flows historically, suggesting that mesquite bosques existed along portions of each river, and the groundwater table was much higher historically which also might have supported significantly more trees of different varieties.

Both the Gila and Santa Cruz rivers were known to have more regular flows historically, suggesting that mesquite bosques existed along portions of each river, and the groundwater table was much higher historically which also might have supported significantly more trees of different varieties. Because of the land ownership status and the sense that the land was worthless because of the lack of a regional airport being built from the 1970s forward, the land had been left entirely alone. The passage of the Arizona Groundwater Act in 1980 guaranteed that the land would never be farmed again. Because of the decline in this desirable flat-land as desert vegetation, the Desert Botanical Garden perceived that the lowland desert was important because it too was becoming more rare, and restoration of this land made it possible to expand the area of this unique ecosystem considerably.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The project was conducted by the Desert Botanical Garden, which is in Phoenix, Arizona. The study sought to see if it was ecologically feasible to establish perennial shrubs on a typical abandoned field that showed no signs of recovery. The study site was chosen because it had not been farmed since the late 1960s and would not be again because of the passage in 1980 of the Arizona Groundwater Act. That legislation actually stipulated that land not irrigated between 1970 and 1975 could no longer be irrigated, thus precluding the land from every being farmed again. Another consideration for the project was that the land had been bought up in the 1970s by speculators who had become interested in the possibility of a regional airport going in to this area, these new land owners had no motivation to care about the condition of the land they owned.

Description of Project Activities: For the project two 1.3 ha barren (less than 0.01 percent perennial plant cover) areas .7  km apart were chosen.  Site 1 was abandoned between 1954 and 1960 while site 2 was abandoned between 1949 and 1954.  Representatives of the original dominant vegetation, including creosotebush, desert saltbush, linear-leaved saltbush, mesquite, wolfberry and globemallow were growing on land that had last been cropped before 1949 within 1 km of site 1 And 300 m of site 2.  These were the perennial species used in the seed mix.  The seed was donated by local native seed companies or collected by DBG volunteers. Initial soil profiles were evaluated by digging two 1.8 m deep trenches with a backhoe.  The top two centimeters were a very fine sandy clay loam with platey structure.  From approximately 2-60 cm the profile consisted of sandy clay loam with a subangular blocky structure.  Below 60-65 cm the profile contained a weakly cemented carbonate horizon (caliche) extending to the bottom of the pit.  Other areas nearby were also examined where natural vegetation had occurred after a brief period of cultivation.  In the upper 3-30 cm of these profiles there was more coarser-textured horizons (sandy loams) which rainwater can more quickly infiltrate.  Planting took place in the winter rainy season in early January 1991 because of the greater predictability of winter rain and lower evaporation.  To increase the amount of water available to the plantings, rainwater running off the barren soil was arrested by low berms arranged on the contour.  Each site was surveyed to determine the direction of slope, which was typically less than 1 percent, then using a border disk they created two rows of nine parallel berms separated by water catchment areas 15 m wide. Each berm was 30 m long and 40 cm high.  Then a stiff-tined ripper was used to create a 2.4 m wide seed bed on the uphill side of each berm, the ripper disturbed the soil to a depth of 10-15 cm and left large clods (5-10 cm diameter) on the soil surface.  At each site, these seed beds were broadcast-seeded with a mixture of perennial shrubs. Only the lower sixteen of the available eighteen plots at each site were included in the experiment.  The two plots on the high end of each site caught water from a much larger runoff area and thus would have produced spurious results.  Half of each plot was designated at random and seeded with Mediterranean grass (Schismus barbata), six-weeks grama (Bouteloua barbata), three-awn grama (Bouteloua aristioides), and Indian wheat (Plantago insularis).  Mediterranean grass is exotic but considered naturalized in the area and was included in the mix because it was the only available cool-season grass.  Each combination of mulch and weeding treatments (four in all) was randomly assigned to four replicate berms at each site.  Half of all berms received wheat straw mulch at the rate of 900 kg/ha (2 tons/acre). Site 1 was seeded and mulched January 3, 1991, after which the plot was run over by a tractor-drawn crimper, as series of weighted, blunt disks which push the straw into deep impressions in the soil.  At this rate of straw application, straw covered about 50 percent of the soil surface.  On site 2, seeded and mulched January 16, the straw as not crimped.  Plots were randomly assigned weeding treatment were hand-weeded when weeds appeared in February, before being weeded again in March, April, and May.  The principal weed in the mulched plots was wheat straw.  All plots had uneven weed infestations, principally of narrow leaf goosefoot, filaree, and London rocket.  Russian thistle or tumble weed did not reach great size or number until early May. In order to measure the effects of mulching and tillage on temperature and water availability, five gypsum moisture blocks were installed one meter apart at two depths, one and 15 cm, in three locations: in a mulched, weeded plot; in an adjacent unmulched, unweeded plot; and between two plots in unmanipulated soil: all at site 1.  Thermocouples were also installed to measure the temperature of the soil at a depth of 1 cm at each location. The thermocouples and gypsum blocks were attached to a computerized data logger which took readings every minute, converted these to hourly averages, and stored the data electronically. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The water catchments were found to work very well. Rain falling in the bare areas between plots flowed into the tilled plot at the front of each berm.  Tillage in the seeded plot had proken up the surface crust allowing water to soak in more easily, and the berm next to each plot prevented any water from flowing off the plot. The timing and amount of rainfall proved to be a major factor influencing the outcome of the experiments.  The ground was worked at site 1 and site 2 on January 3, 1991 and planted at site 1 on the same day.  Sixty-eight mm of rain had fallen since December 15, 1991, leaving a moist and friable seed bed.  The area received 24 mm of rain on January 4-6, 1991, which proved to be ideal for seedling establishment at site 1.  Site 2 was unable to be planted until January 16, by which time the soil had dried out.  No significant rain fell until 15-20 March (24 mm measured on site), desert saltbush and Indian wheat seedlings emerged at site 2 shortly thereafter, but much later and in lower numbers than at site 1.  There was found to be a clear effect of mulch on soil temperature and moisture retention. It was clear that the seedlings were very sensitive to moisture in the top 2 cm of soil, and mulched plots were found to improve soil moisture both near the surface but also at 13-15 cm in depth.  Desert saltbush, linear-leaved saltbush, and Mediterranean grass emerged almost immediately after the rain on January 4.  Warm weather after the March rains triggered germination of mesquite in several plots.  Creosotebush and perhaps wolfberry as well as six-weeks grass and three-awn grass are more likely to germinate during the monsoon rains in the summer. No species other than desert saltbush emerged in sufficient numbers on site 1 to allow for the analysis of treatment differences.  Desert saltbush was found to favor microhabitats behind clods and in low depressions formed by tilling in unmulched plots and throughout the mulched plots.  They survived much better in the mulched, weeded plots.  Although the total percent cover of desert saltbush after three months of grown (4-8 percent) was not impressive, the number of saltbush seedlings in all treatments (4 to 33) was substantially higher than it would be in mature stands. Annual grasses did not come up in sufficient quantity to have any effect on either weed suppression or desert saltbush establishment.  The majority of saltbush seedlings were less than 5 cm high and unbranched, but some of the largest seedlings in the mulched plots had reached 30 cm and were woody and highly branched.  On the other hand, mulching had a (barely) significant effect on average seedling height.  In plots that were mulched and weeded, on the other hand, the mean height of the tallest seedlings was 13.6 cm compared to only 9.6 cm in unmulched, weeded plots.  Overall, the project made clear that active restoration of abandoned farm lands is not warranted if native vegetation will gradually recover on its own.  In those instances devoid of perennial vegetation, far from seed sources, and with barren and altered soil conditions, restoration is feasible. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Rainfall in the desert is ultimately the most stringent climatic factor influencing the success of a desert restoration.  In this instance, not only do the plants need to germinate, but grow large enough to tolerate the drier, normal conditions.  Water catchment systems and mulching clearly increase the chances for seedling establishment.  In a poorer rain year, the results of this project show that there would quite possibly have been no seedlings at all on any of the unmulched plots. The low quantity of plants that were able to germinate indicate that repeated treatments is necessary in desert ecosystems, perhaps every three years a reseeding might be necessary.  The project may have covered 2.6 ha but the actual seeded area was only .23 ha, making it clear that revegetation of the strips between berms would be difficult because of the soil conditions.  One possible element to counter this is that the plantings increased activities of burrowing animals (ground squirrels, coyotes, badgers) elsewhere in the study area, such that they may perhaps break up the surface crust and facilitate subsequent plant establishment.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: A final wave of farm abandonment is likely to occur in the coming years because of ""˜water farming' which will begin happening as rapidly growing cities come to need larger shares of water from the Central Arizona Project.  The wave of retiring old fields has come with the purchase of farms by cities to offset their water usage.  Water farming has no direct effect on the ability or inability of farm land to recover, since the water being used by the municipalities is very deep groundwater, however these abandoned farms may come with the political and economic incentive to restore some of the lost desertscrub habitat.  The effort to restore lowland desert will continue to expand because abandoned farmland will not simply return to desert, but instead requires large-scale restoration techniques.
Restoration in old desert fields is best accomplished by building water catchments, mulching with coarse, woody debris that is slow to break down, and then by replanting a fraction of the restoration area repeatedly until a good rainfall year occurs. Seeding, mulching and catchment techniques need to be tailored to such a long-term approach. This “˜lazy but patient’ method requires a long-term commitment but is not capital-intensive. The cost of seeds may be high but are spread out over the waiting period and offset by savings in irrigation. This approach mimics the natural succession, but enhances it by promoting water infiltration and also by ensuring that when good rainfall does occur seeds are there to take advantage of it. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/spain-quercus-restoration-on-abandoned-agricultural-fields/	Spain: Quercus Restoration on Abandoned Agricultural Fields	Spain	2001-02-01	2003-12-31	"In abandoned Mediterranean croplands, establishment and growth of woody plants are limited by high radiation and low water availability during summer, and weeds are strong competitors for resources, particularly water. This project was conducted as a 3-year experiment in central Spain to study the response of three Quercus species (Q. coccifera, Q. ilex and Q. faginea) that differ in their habitat requirements under treatment ï¬eld conditions which were resulting from the combination of full-light versus artiï¬cial shading and weed presence versus weed mowing. Factors the project measured included seedling survival, resprouting capability and growth, weed production, microclimate (incident photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), air temperature, soil water evaporation and effective precipitation) and soil moisture. Shading and weeds reduced PAR reaching the seedlings and soil water evaporation, and shading also reduced effective precipitation. Shading and mowing increased soil moisture. The project found a clear positive synergic effect of shading and mowing on seedling performance. Weed competition limited seedling survival in all species more than high radiation, whereas the relative importance of these factors in limiting growth depended on the growth measure and species. As hypothesised, the effects of stress release on plot cover, an integrated performance index that combines survival and growth, were most noticeable in Q. faginea, the most mesic species, and least in Q. coccifera, the most xerophytic species. The release of weed competition allowed Q. ilex seedlings to invest resources in above-ground and, apparently, in below-ground growth. Shading increased simultaneous growth in diameter and volume only for Q. faginea. It is important that planted Quercus seedlings in abandoned Mediterranean cropland take advantage of a low competitive environment from weeds during the period before the ï¬rst dry season. Once seedlings have established, an artiï¬cially shaded environment would provide beneï¬ts in terms of plot cover by the oaks, particularly for mesic species.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation Because of declining productivity of the land, intentional setting aside of old cropland for reserve lands, and the movement away from strictly agrarian livelihood in this part of Spain has contributed to many of these lands being abandoned. While succession on these lands occurs, this project sought to evaluate how forest species that were known historically in the oak forests of this part of Spain might be utilized to restore the forests. This part of central Spain has been cultivated for hundreds if not thousands of years. While there are several biosphere reserves in the area, even these ecosystems are not without the influence of human beings. The granitic mountains and rugged landscapes to the northeast of Madrid give rise to holm oak, oak and ash forests. These woods alternate with pasturelands used for grazing and cropped land that is the traditional use of the land. The objective of the project was to assess the combined effects of radiation load and weed competition on the performance of these Quercus species in order to suggest management practices that optimize investment in active restoration of abandoned farmland in central Spain. The study was notable because it was relatively long (3 years) under field conditions. The project tested several hypotheses: first, that shading and mowing would increase water availability to the planted seedlings by decreasing evaporation from soil and transpiration from weeds; second, that the environments with lower radiation and water stress will show little and sustained seedling mortality through time. Similarly, the most stressful environments will show a high mortality that is concentrated in the earliest stages of seedling establishment. The project sought to ask what environments are the most stressful by the seedlings of each species in the study; third, that mortality differences among species under stressful conditions will correspond with ecological soil water preferences shown by the species distribution in the field and the amelioration of the environmental harshness will dilute or eliminate the differences among species; fourth, the project expected that stress release would chiefly favor the performance of the most mesic species (Q. faginea) because environmental conditions will become more similar to its threshold of stress tolerance with respect to the other two species.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Large areas of cropland have been abandoned in recent years in this area of Spain due to productivity loss, social changes, and also set-aside programs. These deforested areas can be left to undergo secondary succession or passive restoration; or they can be actively restored by planting and managing native shrubs and trees to reduce soil erosion, increase biological diversity and create carbon sinks. The environmental conditions of these areas usually differ from those where natural regeneration of shrubs and trees occur because different abiotic and biotic factors hinder the establishment of the introduced woody seedlings. Another factor influencing this project is that revegetation projects usually require an appropriate management plan which is important because large amounts of public and private funds are being invested in cropland reforestation, making this project an important component in regional restoration efforts.

Description of Project Activities: The experiment was laid out in a random plot design. The four treatments resulted from the factorial combination of artiï¬cial shading (shaded versus full-light plots) and weed mowing (mowed versus weed plots). There were four replicate plots per treatment (16 plots in total). Size of each plot was 7.5 m x 7.5 m. The planted seedlings were cultivated from acorns collected in localities climatically similar to the experimental area to minimize the variation in genetic composition. Thirty 1-year-old seedlings, 10 per species, were planted with a regular distribution in each of the 16 plots, being separated from each other by at least 1 m. The plantation scheme followed always a constant species sequence to avoid that two seedlings of the same species were adjacently planted. The seedlings were planted with their 5-cm diameter and 18-cm deep plugs. They were protected with a plastic mesh of 1 cm x 1 cm. Seedling mortality within the ï¬rst month of the experiment was attributed to transplanting problems, and these dead seedlings were replaced. Seedlings were randomly distributed among treatment plots in the experiment. Some of the main species of the weed community were Tragopogon pratensis, Sylibum marianum, Fumaria ofï¬cinales, Medicago sativa, Hordeum muralis, Dactylis glomerata and Chenopodium album. Shading was achieved with a neutral shade cloth placed 1.9 m above the ground to cover the entire plot area, and three additional net pieces on all plot orientations except northwards that were placed 0.5 m above the ground to avoid border effects. The current reduction in radiation is not limiting for plant growth even for exemplary heliophillous species such as Retama sphaerocarpa. Weeds were mowed eight times during the 3 years of the experiment, mainly in spring, to continuously reduce the competition on planted seedlings. Weed height was always maintained lower than seedling height. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Overall, artiï¬cial shading and weed mowing, two techniques intended to facilitate the establishment of native Quercus species in abandoned Mediterranean cropland, ameliorated the environmental harshness of the treated plots and improved oak seedling performance. The results of the experiment are further evidence that high radiation and weed competition limit tree establishment in this type of environment because they reduce water availability to the seedlings. This holds true even for species that are very characteristic of dry sites such as Q. coccifera. Shading was found to reduce the incident photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) that reached the seedlings, while mowing increased it during the dry season.  Weeds provided a natural shad equivalent to one third of the artificial shade that was used and might be beneficial for the introduced seedlings because of the reduction of photo-inhibition damage.  Shading and mowing reduced effective precipitation, but increased soil moisture in the dry season.  This occurred because shading reduced evaporation, but did not significantly increase weed production and the reduction in weed transpiration due to mowing appeared to outweigh the increase in evaporation due to the lack of shading by weeds.  Additionally, the increase in soil moisture was found to be more prominent in deeper soil layers where water was more accessible to seedlings rather than the weeds.  Shading and mowing also increased seedling performance, but there were differences between treatments and species. Weed competition reduced more survival and resprouting capacity than high radiation, suggesting that water shortage is an important limiting factor in this habitat.  Survival under stressful conditions was similarly low for all species, which means that the environmental harshness imposed by full-light or weed competition was usually above the capacity of these species to survive.  The performance between species under the most favorable conditions was inversely related to their soil water preferences.  The results highlight the importance of the first growth season in the recruitment of woody plants. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: There was evidence that water storage is an important limiting factor in this type of habitat.  Additionally, while there were differences between species in survival rates because of different growth volumes in some species. It was also shown that other Mediterranean species and their capacity to withstand severe drought decrease in the shade due to increased below-ground competition for water with established plants.  The first dry season was seen as a bottle-neck for the survival of the introduced seedlings, and close management decreased mortality up to five times for the three species during the first year.  Weed competition limited seedling survival in all species more than high radiation.  The relative importance of these factors in limiting growth depended on the growth measure and species but, overall, shading increased growth more than mowing.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Across the world, cropland is undergoing abandonment for a number of reasons.  Developing active restoration strategies helps to mitigate the changed abiotic and biotic conditions that result from years of active cultivation.  This project demonstrated that active restoration is feasible and desirable and when combined with other strategies can provide an effective approach to cropland restoration.
There is a clear synergetic effect of shading and mowing. For management of Quercus plantations, it is important that the introduced seedlings of these species that advantage of a low competition environment from weeds before the first dry season. Once seedlings have been established, an artificially shaded environment would provide benefits in terms of plot cover by the oaks, the actual target pursued in this type of reforestations, particularly for the most mesic species. While management is expensive and concentration of management reduces investment, for instance shading may be effective and practical in a nursery setting but it is far too expensive to use on a large scale. This approach is feasible for creating little reforested patches in vast deforested agricultural regions. Plots may then act as sources of propagules of Quercus species, thus aiding their later natural establishment. Similar approaches could be tried for other species and/or regions where high radiation and/or herb competition limit the establishment of natural woody vegetation. "

Grass invasions of fountain grass have catalyzed positive feedback loops in which grasses increase the frequency and intensity of the fire regime, which leads to further reductions of woody vegetation and corresponding increases in the spatial distribution and biomass of fire-adapted grasses. The project sought to investigate under what conditions native dry forest species might effectively compete with fountain grass. Because alien grass invasions have been particularly detrimental tropical dry forest ecosystems, the project sought to uncover effective methods to control these grasses and re-establish native populations. The project nvestigated how light availability (full sun and 50% shade), alien grass control (bulldoze, herbicide, plastic mulch, and trim treatments), and native species additions (outplanting and direct-seeding) affected the establishment of native plants and the suppression of a dominant invasive bunchgrass (fountain grass, Pennisetum setaceum).Agriculture & Livestock, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) Introduction of fountain grass has proven catastrophic to these native arid ecosystems, because the grass invasions often catalyze a positive feedback loop, increasing the frequency and intensity of the fire regime. The dense root systems of many invasive grasses also inhibit nutrient and water acquisition by native species, which their extensive above ground grass biomass may thwart their ability to germinate and establish. The end result is the conversion of formerly diverse native ecosystem to near monoculture of fountain grass. The site of the project was, at the outset, a continuous, highly degraded, treeless fountain grass population with virtually no other native or alien species, except occasional clumps of the invasive shrub Lantana camara. Continued grazing and trampling by non-native ungulates also often destroyed remnant stands of native vegetation and increases vulnerability of the system for further alien species invasions. Prior to the invasion of fountain grass and the promotion of non-native ungulate grazing, the dry forests of Hawaii were thought to have more total and native tree species that any other region in the state. From native hibiscus trees to rare shrub species such as Gouania almost one-fourth of native Hawaiian species are found in the dry forests. Many of the vines, shrubs, trees, and birds of the dry forests are threatened. Hawaiian owls hunt in the daytime, while the endangered palila, a beautiful finch-like bird, feeds on the seeds and flowers of mamane trees high up on the slopes of Mauna Kea. Most lowland forests native to Hawaiian are either seasonal or sclerophyllous to some degree and mesic transition forests occur where conditions are favorable. Dry forests can be closed or open canopied, exceeding 20 meters in height in montane habitats. The project’s underlying intent was to establish standards for the further restoration of the dry forest ecosystems found in this part of Hawaii. After first removing non-native ungulate herbivory, the project leaders sought to establish what further interventions would be necessary to restore the native vegetation. This particular project sought out under what conditions native dry forest species could effectively compete with fountain grass.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
These ecosystems contain a highly diverse and unique species assemblage that formerly covered most of the region, ~128,000 hectares. Although this area maintains some of the largest and highest quality native dry forest remnants in the Hawaiian archipelago, this project was considered essential to addressing the multiple problems of degradation and invasion simultaneously. Most of the remaining dry forest along the North Kona coast consists of fragmented, degraded, and senescent patches, threatening to increase the risk of devastating fires. The need for developing some effective, competitive strategies for dealing with fountain grass was seen as a necessity for the future establishment and sustainability of native plant populations.

Description of Project Activities: In December 1998, project participants established four randomized experimental blocks at the study site. Each block consisted of two parallel 34 m long x 10 m wide strips, with 2.3-m spacing between the strips within a block, and 3-m spacing between adjacent strips in different blocks. To investigate the effect of available light, researchers erected 50% shade cloth structures over one randomly selected strip within each block, and allowed the remaining strip to receive ambient full sunlight. This treatment approximated the amount of shading produced by mature forest canopies in the restored ecosystem. Each strip contained four 6 x 6 m plots spaced 2 m apart from each other and the edge of the strip, for a total of 32 plots within this experiment (4 blocks x 2 strips/block x 4 plots/strip). Researchers randomly distributed four fountain grass control treatments (bulldoze, herbicide, plastic mulch, and trim) among the four plots within each strip so that each plot received a different grass treatment. For the bulldoze treatment, researchers removed the top 15 - 25 cm of lava substrate and fountain grass by scraping the blade of a D-8 Caterpillar tractor backwards across the surface of each plot. For the herbicide treatment, researchers ï¬rst weed-whacked the grass to ground level, then sprayed a 1% Roundup solution onto the cut grass in January and April 1999 as the grass began ï¬‚ushing back. For the plastic mulch treatment, researchers ï¬rst weed-whacked the grass to ground level, then covered the entire plot with a heavy, 100% light-blocking black plastic mesh in an attempt to smother and ""˜""˜cook'' the underlying fountain grass clumps and soil seed bank until the plastic was removed one day before the experiment began (120 days later). For the trim treatment, researchers weed-whacked the grass down to 60 cm in height one week before the experiment began. In the latter three treatments, researchers left the weed-whacked fountain grass stems and associated litter in place, and did not remove them from the plots. Researchers did not use unmanipulated, intact fountain grass stands as a control treatment because previous research and observations have shown that few native species can germinate and/or establish within this environment. However, this trim treatment was a relatively moderate form of grass control that resulted in, on average, more than ï¬ve times more initial fountain grass cover than any of the other treatments. In May 1999, researchers subdivided each plot into four 3 x 3 m quadrats and randomly selected one quadrat within each plot to receive native outplants. Researchers then designated the quadrat located diagonally across from the outplant quadrat to receive native seeds, while the remaining two quadrats within each plot served as controls for these treatments (no native species added). Researchers used this design so that quadrats with added native species would always be adjacent to and bordered by quadrats without added native species. Since each individual quadrat was equally likely to receive the outplant, seeding, or control treatment in a random and nonbiased manner, this restricted randomization design was unlikely to affect the statistical analysis of this experiment. All outplants and seeds used in this experiment originated from seeds collected from plants growing within or close to the upper Kaupulehu Preserve. Researchers chose species for the outplanting and/or direct-seeding treatments based on their seed abundance and ability to establish and grow in the ï¬eld. To produce the outplants, seeds were sown in a greenhouse between December 1998 and January 1999 in ï¬‚ats containing Pro-Mix BX potting soil, transplanted into conetainers as the seedlings developed, then transported from the greenhouse to the ï¬eld site one month prior to outplanting to harden off. For each outplant quadrat, researchers transplanted 44 individuals comprised of seven native species into a 1.8 x 1.8 m planting area centered within the quadrat, with 32-cm spacing between each plant. Prior to transplantation, researchers mixed the outplants together so that the different species were haphazardly interspersed with each other. The outplanting and direct-seeding treatments were performed on 17 May 1999. Outplanting was accomplished by creating or exploiting cracks in the lava with metal digging bars and mixing premoistened Pro-Mix soil into the planting hole as needed to support the transplanted seedlings. For the direct-seeding treatment, researchers sowed a mixture of 12 native species evenly across a 1.8 x 1.8 m area centered within each seeded quadrat. Prior to sowing, researchers soaked the seeds of some species for 24  -  48 hr in cold or hot water as necessary to scarify the seeds and facilitate germination as determined by preliminary trials. Researchers fertilized each outplant quadrat with Vita-Start B-12 and Peters 20:20:20 following the manufacturer's recommendations in May, June, and October 1999. To help the establishing plants survive the extreme heat and drought during the summer of 2000 (see Fig. 2), in July 2000 we also fertilized all outplanted and seeded quadrats using Osmocote 14:14:14. They did not fertilize the control quadrats at this time, because they did not contain any establishing plants. 
Previous research demonstrated that few native species can establish without supplemental water during the extended drought periods that frequently occur within this study system, in this experiment we watered all quadrats (outplant, seeded, and the two controls within each plot) with an automated gravity-fed irrigation system using the following regime: every day for the ï¬rst three weeks of the experiment, every other day for the next 3.5 months, every third day for the following three months, once a week for the next ï¬ve months, once every four days during the heat and drought of July - August 2000, then back to once a week until the end of the experiment in December 2000. Water was administered in the early morning for 5 min using sprinkler heads positioned at the corners of each plot (four heads per plot) that delivered 3.8 L per head per min. The total amount of water delivered to each plot over the 20-mo experiment was ~2900 L. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Throughout the experiment, rain was generally modest and patchy, with 11 of the 20 months having less than 20 mm of total precipitation and only four months with greater than 50 mm. Total precipitation during the three summer months was only 5.3 and 43.2 mm in 1999 and 2000, respectively, while November was the wettest month in both years with 67.6 and 186.2 mm, respectively. The percent cover of native species increased in all light and grass control treatments throughout the study site. The percent cover of native species in the shaded quadrats was nearly twice that of the full-sun quadrats during most of the study. The relative percent cover of native species among the grass control treatments also remained fairly consistent over time, with the greatest cover in the bulldozed quadrats, intermediate cover in the plastic mulch and herbicide quadrats, and the least cover in the trim quadrats. The percent cover of fountain grass also increased in all treatments throughout the experiment. There was little difference in fountain grass cover between the shaded and full-sun quadrats, and between the bulldoze, plastic mulch, and herbicide quadrats, but the percent cover of fountain grass in the trim quadrats was consistently about twice that of any other treatment. The ï¬nal percent cover of native species differed signiï¬cantly among the light, grass control, and species addition quadrats, but there were no signiï¬cant interactions among these three treatments. For the light treatments, there was signiï¬cantly more native cover in the shaded vs. full-sun quadrats (40.2 Â± 3.8% vs. 27.4 Â± 3.7%). Native cover among the grass control treatments was signiï¬cantly greater in the bulldoze quadrats (45.5 Â± 5.3%) than the herbicide (33.8 Â± 5.2%) or trim quadrats (20.3 Â± 4.7%), and marginally greater than in the plastic mulch quadrats (35.7 Â± 5.4%). The percent cover of natives did not differ signiï¬cantly between the herbicide and plastic mulch quadrats, but both of these were significantly greater than the trim treatment. Among the species addition treatments, native percent cover in the outplanted quadrats (69.1 Â± 3.5%) was signiï¬cantly greater than the seeded (35.3 Â± 5.6%) quadrats, and both of these treatments were signiï¬cantly greater than the control (15.5 Â± 1.7%). The ï¬nal percent cover of fountain grass differed signiï¬cantly among the grass control and species addition treatments, but not between the two light treatments. Final fountain grass cover in the outplanted quadrats (36.3 Â± 5.2%) was signiï¬cantly less than the control (47.7 Â± 3.7%), and marginally less than the seeded quadrats (45.2 Â± 5.8%), while the latter two treatments did not differ signiï¬cantly from each other. Among the grass control treatments, the ï¬nal percent cover of fountain grass was signiï¬cantly greater in the trim (80.3 Â± 3.1%) than in the herbicide (34.3 Â± 4.3%), plastic mulch (33.0 Â± 4.3%), or bulldoze quadrats (29.3 Â± 3.9%), but there were no signiï¬cant differences in fountain grass cover among the latter three treatments. The initial percent cover of native species and fountain grass at the beginning of the experiment were signiï¬cantly, positively correlated with the ï¬nal percent cover of native species and fountain grass at the end of the experiment, respectively. The initial and ï¬nal percent cover of fountain grass, as well as the initial and ï¬nal grass height and percent grass in ï¬‚ower were all also signiï¬cantly, negatively correlated with the ï¬nal percent cover of native species. Native cover was dominated by three shrub (Chenopodium oahuense, Dodonaea viscosa, and Sophora chrysophylla) and two vine species (Canavalia hawaiiensis and Ipomoea indica), while the percent cover of the remaining outplanted and seeded species (as well as all alien species other than fountain grass) was generally negligible. Outplant survival in all light and grass control treatments declined fairly consistently over the course of the experiment. Analysis of the temporal pattern of outplant survival between the light treatments showed that these two curves differed signiï¬cantly, with generally higher survival in the shaded quadrats, although by the end of the experiment, survival was similar in both light environments. Outplant survival in the grass control treatments was highest in the herbicide and plastic mulch quadrats and lowest in the bulldoze and trim quadrats; analysis of these survival curves also found signiï¬cant differences among these four treatments. The proportion of outplants surviving to the end of the experiment differed signiï¬cantly among the grass control treatments and among the different species outplanted, but it did not differ signiï¬cantly between the light treatments and there was not a signiï¬cant light by grass control interaction. Although for most individual species, outplant survival was lowest in the trim quadrats, the grass control treatment with the greatest outplant survival varied considerably among the different species. 

The results from this study and previous research within this ecosystem suggest that even highly degraded tropical dry forests may be at least partially restored. This experiment began in a treeless section of a small Hawaiian dry forest preserve dominated by dense African fountain grass stands containing virtually no other alien or native species. Yet, by the end of the 20-month study, some experimental quadrats had 80% cover of native species and 15% cover of fountain grass. Even in some control (nonplanted or seeded) quadrats, the vegetative spread of native vines and establishment of native shrubs from newly produced seeds in adjacent quadrats resulted in 30% native cover and 25% cover of fountain grass. Oceanic island communities in general, and Hawaiian ecosystems in particular, have proven notoriously susceptible to the devastating effects of alien species invasions. The inability of island ï¬‚oras to successfully compete with alien plants is often attributed in part to their evolution in a relatively noncompetitive and unique environment. However, the results of this study and other research within and outside of Hawaii suggest that in some cases, island plant species may successfully compete or at least co-exist with aggressive alien species. For example, in another experiment within this study system that occurred under essentially fountain grass-free conditions, researchers found that subsequent weeding did not signiï¬cantly improve the performance of native species, even though by the end of that experiment many non-weeded plots were completely covered by two notoriously noxious alien species. This project has also shown that some relatively simple and inexpensive techniques can greatly facilitate the establishment of native species in grass-invaded ecosystems. Previous research in Hawaiian dry forests also showed that few native species germinate or establish in unmanipulated fountain grass populations. In the present study we found that, even relative to trimmed fountain grass stands, all three more aggressive grass control treatments had signiï¬cantly more native cover throughout the experiment. The most radical technique, bulldozing, produced the greatest native cover, even though its fountain grass cover was not signiï¬cantly less than the herbicide and plastic mulch treatments. This result may have been caused by decreased fountain grass root biomass and/or increased soil water availability (via crushing the lava substrate into smaller and more uniform pieces with the bulldozer tines) in the bulldozed quadrats, although researchers did not measure either of these variables in this experiment. The results of this experiment clearly demonstrate the importance of native species additions to the restoration of degraded ecosystems such as Hawaiian dry forests. Despite creating numerous seemingly favorable microsites of supplemental water, shade, and aggressive initial grass control, there was virtually no ""˜""˜natural'' (i.e., unplanted) recruitment of native species into these or any other experimental quadrats over the 20 months of this study. In contrast, both the outplanting and direct-seeding treatments resulted in the establishment of relatively diverse populations of native vine and shrub species that continued to expand right up to the end of the experiment. We also found a signiï¬cant overall negative relationship between the percent cover of native species and fountain grass cover, height, and percent in ï¬‚ower. This result may imply that in contrast to mature native canopy trees, these native understory species effectively compete with fountain grass for water and/or nutrients, and thus establishing vigorous populations of native vines and shrubs could be an effective technique for at least partially suppressing alien grass populations. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Plant performance in the outplanting and direct-seeding treatments showed considerable variation both among the different species and among the light and grass control treatments. For example, outplant survival ranged from 23% for the canopy tree Diospyros sandwicensis to 91% for the shrub Chenopodium oahuense, and while the survival of Diospyros outplants was more than three times greater in the shade, Chenopodium survival was virtually identical in the full-sun and shade environments. Similarly, four of the 12 species seeded into the experiment produced no surviving individuals, three species yielded an average of 0.3 individuals/quadrat, and the remaining ï¬ve species produced between 3.8 - 21.9 individuals. Researchers also did not ï¬nd a consistent relationship between the performance of individual species in the outplant and seeding treatments, or between the natural abundance of species and their performance in the experiment. For instance, seeds of the most common native shrub in this study system, Nototrichium sandwicense, essentially failed to germinate in any experimental quadrat, but had 70% outplant survival. Conversely, Chenopodium produced nearly half of the total number of sur viving seeded individuals, its outplants had the highest survival, and were on average twice as long as the next largest species, but its natural abundance and dominance is far less than three of the four other shrub species used in this experiment. Researchers also found an inverse relationship between the performance of the two endangered canopy trees seeded into this experiment, Colubrina oppositifolia and Kokia drynarioides, and their natural abundance. Although the ï¬nal survival of both species in this experiment was poor, at their peak before the heat and drought of the summer of 2000, there were a total of 13 Colubrina and 80 Kokia seedlings. Yet, while there are still bands of Colubrina trees scattered across the study site and 280 individuals left in the state, the Hawaiian-island endemic Kokia has only three wild individuals remaining. The response of these species to the experimental treatments was also distinct: whereas at its peak there were nearly three times more Kokia individuals in the trimmed-grass quadrats relative to the next most abundant grass treatment, and there was little difference in abundance between the two light environments, Colubrina abundance was more than three times greater in the shade relative to full sun conditions, but did not differ dramatically among the grass control treatments.  These results highlight the importance of investigating species- and treatment-speciï¬c responses before attempting larger scale restoration projects, particularly when using rare species with limited seed availability. For example, this experiment suggests that direct-seeding vigorous sun-tolerant shrubs and vines might be a cost-effective technique for both suppressing fountain grass and creating microenvironments to facilitate the establishment of slower growing, rarer species like Colubrina, while carefully managed fountain grass stands might serve as a better nurse environment for Kokia.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Because of the highly fragmented and degraded condition of the native dry forests in Hawaii and throughout the tropics, even successful restoration projects of even a few hectares could create urgently needed new habitat for rare species.  Such restorations could serve as a much-needed propagule source and catalyst for even larger projects.
With the conclusion of this project, it is possible that there is now sufficient knowledge to attempt tropical dry forest restoration projects at ever larger spatial scales. Based on this research and the work of others, it is clear that dry forest restoration in Hawaii and other regions with similar ecological dynamics should focus on three major objectives: (1) reduction or complete removal of non-native ungulates, (2) control of dominant invasive grasses, and (3) exploitation of existing or creation of new favorable microsites combined with reintroduction of carefully selected native species to these areas. This project was a part of a larger Kona Dryland Forest Restoration Working Group dedicated to collaborative management and restoration of the dry forests in Kona, the creation of this group indicates a broader social commitment to the restoration of the dry forests in Kona.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/colombia-choco-forest-restoration-in-afro-columbian-communities/	Colombia: Chocó Forest Restoration in Afro-Columbian Communities	Colombia	2008-07-01	2008-07-01	"This restoration project draws from Analogue Forestry, which is the name for forestry techniques that integrates the needs of local communities in the restoration of ecosystems, creating food security as well as economic benefits for their families. This project sought to counter the excessive and uncontrolled exploitation of the natural resources in the Chocó bioregion of Columbia among underserved Afro-Columbian communities which had long resulted in the loss of biodiversity and the impoverishment of the population in terms of income loss and food insecurity. Emerging from the framework of Law 70 in 1993 which adjudicated collective lands to Afro-Columbian communities, the rise of Community Councils in these effected municipalities have begun to implement plans for territorial administration. The project sought to provide training and technical knowledge for these communities to implement techniques of ecological restoration to reduce dependence on mining and provide incentives for diversification and provide for food security among the communities.NOTE: Throughout this case study, the use of the term Analogue Forestry (AF) can be partially conflated with ecological restoration techniques because AF utilizes many practices that are indistinguishable from ecological restoration technique. Additionally, although AF maintains its own identity, it clearly draws from restoration ecology and the methods and guidelines promulgated by SER.Mining & Resource Extraction The primary subsistence activities today are the exploitation of natural resources and this occupies the majority of the population, alternating between activities in mining, fishing, lumber and subsistence agriculture. For centuries, mining has been the main productive activity in the region. Before the arrival of Spaniards, these lands were inhabited by different indigenous groups (Kunas, Emberas, and Waunanas). Due to the immense natural wealth of the mines in Chocó and the difficult climatic conditions, Spaniards brought over African slaves, and the indigenous populations were displaced. The history of Chocó is therefore intertwined with gold and platinum mining. In fact mining has proven time after time, to be the biggest incentive in the colonization of these lands. This reliance on mining has continued through the years, always controlled by foreign national and international actors. Yet, the fact that communities have gained control over their lands is a huge opportunity to change these historical patterns and allow local communities to benefit from the sustainable use of their natural resources. The Chocó is located in the northwest corner of South America, along the Pacific coast of Colombia and parts of Ecuador and Panama. Its shores reach the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and at the east it borders the western range of the Andes. It extends from the mountainous area of Darién in Panama, along the length of the Pacific coast of Colombia, until Cape Pasado in the province of Manabí in northwest Ecuador, covering approximately 145,000 square kilometers. The three countries of the eco-region still possess nearly 58% of the total area as intact forest, especially in Colombia and Panama, and 46% with various levels of intervention. The Choco is one of the most important eco-regions in the world due to its biological and cultural diversity. It comprises lowlands, deserts at the foothills of the Andes, tropical rainforest and coastal areas, and the locations and combination of coasts and mountains create very diverse climatic patterns (annual precipitation between 2,000 and 13,000 mm, varying with the latitude and distance from the coast).
Some dominant types of land cover in the region are: swampland, scrub, humid pastures, wetlands, and alluvial forests, lowland rainforests (tropical rainforest), mountain forests, high plains, and arid forests. The eco-region has a significant number of endemic species: up to 400 types of trees and 800 vertebrates per hectare; seven to eight thousand types of plants and 100 endemic. In addition, migratory species like the humpback whales; hawksbill, leatherback, black, and loggerhead turtles, shorebirds and plovers, visit its coast each year for the purposes of breeding, nesting, feeding, and raising young, depending on the species. The area is also a centre of diversity and endemism of butterflies. Its population consists of communities descended from African slaves, indigenous communities (currently six: Tule, Embera, Eperara Siapidara, Wounaan, Awa, and Chachi) and mestizos. From the outset the project sought to: 1) Restore ecosystems degraded by mining; 2) Recover and increase biodiversity in the collective territories of Afro-Colombian communities; 3) Foster nutritional security and independence for the local population; 4) Train the communities in the implementation of Analogue Forestry and other ecological restoration techniques; 5) Reduce the dependence on mining by providing incentives for productive diversification; 6) Provide support and build organisational capacity for the local communities through external NGO support.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
According to the 1993 national census the population of the Colombian department of Chocó is 542,962 people, comprised of Afro-Colombian communities which are descendants of the African slaves brought over to work in the gold and platinum mines, and indigenous and mestizo communities. In 1991 the Colombian political constitution was amended. Among the reforms was Law 70, commonly referred to as ley de negritudes which recognize the rights of the Afro-Colombian communities. This law gave these the Afro-Columbian communities collective land rights and created community councils to administer collective territories. All mining communities involved in the Green Gold initiative are covered by Law 70 and thus hold collective title to their lands.

Description of Project Activities: At the outset of the project the first effort was to conduct a participatory diagnoses of the ecosystems under consideration. These diagnoses were meant to establish farmers' needs and interests, their priorities when planting in their parcels, and their expectations from the projects and the commitments they were willing to assume. This is how the analogue forestry designs of the parcels were established. Then the teams conducted ecological evaluations and developed ecological descriptions of native forests in order to understand the main characteristics of the forests being restored to the farmers' parcels. ""¨Once an ecological baseline was established, community nurseries were built so that the selected native species could be multiplied for later transplanting into each of the parcels.""¨ The parcels for restoration were represented on a map and each map noted which species were planted.""¨ This stage is the point at which Analog forestry designs were produced for each parcel and diverged from traditional ecological restoration practice. The designs specified which species needed to be planted where, and did so in a way that enhanced the ecosystem as an agro-ecosystem. The families' tradition of growing specific crops for their consumption was included into the design of each parcel; so that it would answer to their needs and to the project's objective of restoring biodiversity.  All the families that were involved received technical assistance to develop their land use practices. Each family was initially trained in the analog forestry and restoration techniques and afterwards they received advice from local leaders trained on the use of the technique. The objective was to empower communities so they will lead the processes in each of their parcels. On occasion, it has been necessary to emphasize on the need of planting certain species which have no apparent value to them, but that have an important ecological value (for example they may aid in soil regeneration, or may produce shade which is vital for other species to grow, or may be vital in the natural succession processes).""¨ Community leaders have used this project and the technical assistance it implies, to promote the use of ""Azoteas"", a traditional form of growing plants on elevated containers in Chocó, to grow crops and medicinal plants. This contributes to the preservation of the community's culture and also to greater food security for the community. In 2007 more than 4000 trees of 21 different species were planted in the families' parcels and more than 5000 small trees were produced in the tree nurseries (including fruit trees, trees for timber exploitation, medicinal plants, plants for forage, amongst others).   Four workshops on the commercial aspects of the project have been organized (two of them in 2007). In them, representatives from productive family units have learned more about productive chains and commercialization. ""¨Training sessions for community leaders have also helped them improve their administrative skills (use of different software, reporting needs and accounting include some of the main topics that have been worked on). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: 1) The protection and restoration of lands.
The communities of Condoto and Tadó are carrying out in the restoration of areas degraded by mining through the implementation of Analogue Forestry (AF). AF was found to be successful when implemented at different stages of vegetation coverage such as fallow lands, pastures, agricultural areas or agro forests, up to the formation of climax forests. In the most sterile soils of Condoto and Tadó, where mechanized mining has radically affected the fertility of the soils, vegetable species are introduced that fix atmospheric nitrogen and incorporate it in the recycling of nutrients. In other soils where the topsoil has not been affected as much, wood, fruit, and ornamental species are introduced, among others, to increase the biodiversity and advance towards the construction of biological corridors.

2)  Health and Food Security
The 90 Productive Family Units certified as having met the certification criteria for green metals have plantations of fruit and vegetable trees in and around their mines that complement their food security and independence. Furthermore the communities have an arboretum and seed bank in addition to 8 community nurseries. The seeds and cultivated seedlings grown there contribute to increasing the food security of more than 500 people, and are used for the further restoration of degraded areas.

3) Community Restoration
The permanent presence of the leaders in the 8 communities where the AF projects are being implemented, includes organizing work performed by the Greater Community Councils and environmental education that touches on topics like land titles, Law 70 and management plans, among others, have contributed to further community strengthening. Analogue Forestry is implemented through a participative methodology that links the members of the community in planning, design, and implementation, creating spaces for participation that contribute to the creation of social capital. In the communities, 20 people have been trained as community leaders. Also, the Community Councils of Condoto and Tadó have advanced in the land management of nearly 143,000 hectares titled as collective lands or Afro-Colombian communities. 

4) Employment and Income generation.
The implementation of Analogue Forestry in the construction and maintenance of the nurseries and the arboretum and the restoration of areas degraded by mining has contributed significantly to the generation of jobs in the area.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: In addition to the expansion of ecological knowledge in these communities, the project has expanded the sustainable management of the collective territories.  Through the restoration of the degraded areas there has been an increase in income generation, biodiversity, as well as increased food security and health.  The land management plans being enacted and discussed by the local communities further sustainable techniques for further expansion of the restoration efforts onto some 143,000 hectares under community management.
The project has expanded environmental education into all the affected communities and is actively educating the younger generation. The program is participated and trains community leaders to act as replicating agents of the program. Monitoring programs are also being established to what synergies between pioneering species and established ones exist, allowing for more adaptive management of the project "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/china-inner-mongolia-stipa-krylovii-steppe-restoration/	China: Inner Mongolia: Stipa Krylovii Steppe Restoration	China	2001-01-01	2002-01-01	"The landscapes of Inner Mongolia are widely known for the vast Stipa krylovii steppes. However, overgrazing and other improper land uses have extensively degraded the Stipa krylovii steppe ecosystem in recent decades. Knowledge about the soil seed banks and the remaining vegetation in these damaged ecosystems is crucial for guiding all future restoration efforts. Using a germination method, this project sought to examine the size, composition, and species richness of the soil seed banks in three ï¬eld types: overgrazed steppe, enclosed steppe and abandoned crop ï¬eld. It was found that the abandoned crop ï¬eld had the largest soil seed bank with mostly annual and weedy plant species. Seeds of desirable perennial grass species were impoverished by the intensive cultivation in the abandoned crop ï¬eld. The lack of desirable perennial species in the abandoned ï¬eld was a critical limiting factor for restoration. Grazing decreased the size of the seed bank in the overgrazed steppe. But seeds of desirable grassland species were present in both the overgrazed and the enclosed steppes. As indicated by the Sorenson’s indices of community similarity (50 – 67%), plant species abundance and composition in the soil seed banks were closely related to the corresponding vegetation for each of the three sites.Agriculture & Livestock The primary factors degrading the ecosystem has been overgrazing, expansion of crop cultivation, and hasty development, combined with possible climate change, which has resulted in a fast decline of the original ecosystems, severe soil erosion, and more frequent sandstorms. Because of overgrazing and indiscriminate cultivation in recent decades about 60% of the land has become severely degraded. Most of the steppe has been used for livestock grazing for centuries. The grazing intensity has increased substantially during the past decades. Livestock grazing has been stopped in the enclosed steppe since the year 2001. The old crop ï¬eld was abandoned in 2001, before which wheat and oats were the main crops. The landscape is steppe, woodland and cropland. The steppe is dominated by the perennial bunch grass, Stipa krylovii, with is the major vegetation type in the region. The vegetation of Stipa krylovii steppe mainly consists of Stipa krylovii, Artemisia sieversiana, Artemisia frigida, Agropyron cristatum, Allium bidentatum and Salsola collina.Due to the increasing desertification and degraded nature of the project lands, the project sought to establish the condition of the soil seed banks as a precondition for further restoration interventions.  The project was motivated by the understanding that any restoration required a more complete picture of the conditions at the site in order to guide and inform future efforts.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Chinese government decided to ban grazing and cultivation on most of the degraded land, hoping for natural recovery.  However, because it was unknown what an acceptable speed for the recovery process would be active ecological restoration studies were encouraged to evaluate what might be necessary to accelerate that process.

Description of Project Activities: Soil seed bank sampling was performed at the end of March, 2004, just prior to natural germination of seeds. Four 20 x 20 sq m -plots were chosen at each of the three ï¬eld types. Sixteen soil cores (6 cm in diameter) were sampled randomly to a depth of 5 cm from each plot. Seed banks were determined using a germination method, which is a commonly used and convenient approach for the ï¬eld survey of soil seed banks. After removing gravels, litter and roots, the soil sample from each soil core was spread to form a thin layer (about 2 cm) over a thick layer of seed-free sand in a nursery pot. Three other pots ï¬lled with only seed-free sand were used as controls to monitor the occurrence of airborne seeds. The sand used in the germination test was pre-baked for 4 h at 150 C in the oven. All pots were randomly arranged in a glasshouse (temperature ranging between 12 and 22C) and allowed to germinate under natural light conditions.  All pots were watered once or twice daily to keep the surface moist. As seedlings emerged, they were identiï¬ed and then removed from the pots, while those that could not be identiï¬ed were further transplanted to other pots and kept growing until they could be identiï¬ed. Soil in each pot was mixed once every 2 weeks to maximize possible germination. Germination trials lasted for approximately 4 months.  Vegetation was investigated twice by recording the species present in eight 0.5 m x 0.5 m- quadrats randomly located in each ï¬eld types. The ï¬rst survey was conducted on 30 May, 2004 when the steppe plants were still in vegetative growth, and the second was on 4 August when steppe plants were at their reproductive stage. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: No seedlings were found in the control pots, indicating that there were no airborne seed contaminants. Altogether 3276 seedlings belonging to 34 species were germinated, which resulted in a calculated mean of 6035 seeds per sq m. The largest seed bank was found in the abandoned ï¬eld, the smallest seed bank was found in the grazed steppe, and intermediate in the enclosed steppe. Annual grasses only found in the soil seed bank of the abandoned ï¬eld. Annual forbs dominated in the abandoned ï¬eld soil seed bank. Perennial grasses occurred more in the soil seed bank of grazed steppe and enclosed steppe, and perennial forbs occurred more in the enclosed steppe soil seed bank. The number of species was the largest in soil samples from the abandoned ï¬eld, intermediate in the enclosed steppe, and the lowest in soils from the grazed steppe. Perennial forbs and perennial grasses dominated in the soil seed banks of both the enclosed steppe and the grazed steppe, while annual forbs and annual grasses were present almost exclusively in the abandoned ï¬eld soil seed bank. Comparisons of the species similarity between the seed bank and the vegetation for the three sites were made by employing Sorenson's index for community similarity. The species similarity indices between the soil seed bank and the established vegetation in the three sites ranged from 50% to about 67%. The dominant species in the soil seed bank of the abandoned ï¬eld were Artemisia sieversiana, Polygonum divaricatum and Chenopodium aristatum, accounting for 68.1% of the total seedlings for the site, while in the grazed steppe and the enclosed steppe the most abundant species were Artemisia frigida and Stipa krylovii, accounting for 55.8% and 52.5% of their respective totals. The species composition in the soil seed bank of the abandoned ï¬eld was different from that of both the grazed steppe and the enclosed steppe, only 7 of the 23 species in the soil seed bank of the abandoned ï¬eld were found in that of both the grazed steppe and the enclosed steppe. Artemisia sieversiana, P. divaricatum and C. aristatum, the dominated species in the soil seed bank of the abandoned ï¬eld, were not found in grazed steppe and enclosed steppe. Artemisia frigida and Stipa krylovii were the dominant species in the seed bank of both grazed steppe and enclosed steppe, but no seeds of Artemisia frigida and only 9 seeds of Stipa krylovii were found in the soil seed bank of the abandoned ï¬eld. The grazed steppe and the enclosed steppe were relatively similar in soil seed bank composition, 10 species occurred both in the soil seed bank of grazed steppe and that of enclosed steppe, and the dominated species were the same. The species composition in the soil seed bank of the abandoned ï¬eld is different from that of both the grazed steppe and the enclosed steppe. The seed banks of grassland species have been impoverished by agricultural intensiï¬cation and tend to be replaced by annual and weedy species in the abandoned ï¬eld. Based on these results researchers accepted their working hypothesis-II: stopping grazing in the enclosed ï¬eld increases the overall density and species richness of the soil seed bank as compared to the grazed treatment. The seed bank of Chenopodium glaucum was found to beneï¬t from grazing. Artemisia frigida and Stipa krylovii were abundant, Leymus chinensis and some other desirable species were also presented in the soil seed banks of the grazed steppe and the enclosed steppe, indicating that restoration of this heavily grazed steppe is not seed-limited. Stopping livestock grazing for 3 years increased the number of perennial forbs in the seed bank. After enclosure for 3 years, the vegetation in the enclosed steppe was obviously taller and richer in litter, which was in contrast to the thin and short vegetation in the grazed steppe. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The lack of seeds of desirable perennial grasses has usually been the key factor limiting for restoring diverse grassland communities from an abandoned field. The introduction of desirable species by sowing, seed cutting, and grazing management and some other techniques should be applied to overcome this biotic constraint in the restoration of Stipa krylovii steppe from the abandoned ï¬eld. High proportions of annual forbs in both the soil seed bank and in the vegetation of the abandoned ï¬eld suggest that it is still in the early stage of succession. The lack of seeds of desirable perennial grasses in the abandoned ï¬eld may prevent the restoration of this land back to the original steppe. The impoverishment of desirable grassland species in the soil seed bank has not occurred in the overgrazed steppe. Therefore, the researchers were inclined to partially accept their working hypothesis that the impoverished seed bank in the abandoned ï¬eld limits the restoration of the degraded Stipa krylovii steppe. Compared to the enclosed steppe, we can see the decrease in seed density in the soil seed bank in the grazed steppe.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: In this project, more plant species were found in the above-ground vegetation than in the soil seed bank for both the enclosed steppe and the grazed steppe. This result indirectly suggested that asexual reproduction was a primary mean of reproduction in the two sites. If this is true for all steppe ecosystems, the preservation of perennial vegetation may play a more important role in grassland recovery than soil seed banks. This further implies that there might a threshold in remaining vegetative storage for natural recovery. Once the remaining vegetative storage for asexual reproduction drops below a certain threshold, natural recovery is severely hindered. Finding this threshold in remaining vegetative storage for reproduction should be an important task for future research. The species composition and the dominant species in the soil seed bank in the grazed steppe are similar to that in the enclosed steppe. This result implies that it might be easier to restore the bunch grass steppe damaged by overgrazing than to restore the abandoned ï¬eld back to the native vegetation status by natural means. For the abandoned ï¬eld, manipulated measures, e.g. reseeding desirable species, cutting and grazing management, etc, will be required to speed up the restoration after a long period of intensive cultivation in the agro-pastoral eco-tone of north China.

This project set out to examine the ecological processes that limit the creation of diverse grassland communities on ex-arable land. The multi-site project on a wide variety of soil types and locations throughout lowland Britain showed it was possible to create and maintain these communities under a hay-cutting and grazing management regime. The project also found there was a high degree of repeatability of treatment effects across the sites. Lack of desirable species seed was the key factor limiting the assembly of diverse grassland communities. Sowing a species-rich seed mix overcame this, while deep cultivation caused significant reductions in soil P and K concentrations that are often found in ex-arable land. The project also evaluated the use of a nurse crop among the treatments, which was found to be of little beneficial effect. Treatments corresponded closely to specified target communities defined by the UK National Vegetation Classification (NVC).Agriculture & Livestock Post-war intensiï¬cation of agricultural management together with land-use change have resulted in the large-scale degradation and fragmentation of this habitat. It has been estimated that unimproved grassland declined in area by 97% in lowland England and Wales between 1930 and 1984, so that no more than 865 sq km of this habitat now remain. The project was conducted on five Environmentally Sensitive Areas in lowland England. The plant communities that were sought as targets, as defined under the NVC are: 1) Bromus erectus grassland, with a Centaurea nigra subcommunity; 2) Cynosurus cristatus-Centaurea nigra grassland, Lathyrus pratensis subcommunity; 3) Cynosurus cristatus-Centaurea nigra grassland, Danthonia decumbens subcommunity. The project tried to examine the effectiveness of practical treatments to overcome possible limitations on diverse grassland creation. These treatments were designed speciï¬cally to investigate the relative importance of the following hypotheses: (i) diverse plant communities described by the NVC are useful ecological targets for restoration on ex-arable land; (ii) the assembly of these plant communities is seed limited; (iii) reduction of soil fertility can promote assembly of diverse communities; and (iv) establishment of desirable species can be enhanced by the amelioration of abiotic and biotic conditions through sowing a nurse crop. In order to test the generality of the treatment effects, they were applied at ï¬ve sites distributed across different regions of southern England, with differing climates, management histories, soil types and nutrient status. Therefore a further hypothesis was tested by this meta-analysis: (v) these treatment effects are reproducible over a range of sites.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) requires the sympathetic management of all remaining grassland fragments together with the recreation of 2000 ha of various types of species-rich grassland over the next decade. Much of this will be achieved within the agri-environment schemes such as the Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) designation. Carefully targeted habitat creation can be a useful tool for the conservation of such biodiverse habitats. However, the results of previous restoration under the agri-environment schemes have been inconsistent. The project used the NVC to derive target diverse grassland communities that were appropriate to the location, soil, hydrology and proposed management of each site. The National Vegetation Classiï¬cation (NVC) is a systematic phytosociological description of British plant communities. The NVC describes 860 communities and subcommunities that have been derived from the analysis of 35,000 quadrats interpreted using information on management and environmental variables. Such classiï¬cation systems provide a useful template for selecting appropriate ecological targets for habitat restoration and for monitoring progress towards their attainment.

Description of Project Activities: The project consisted of a randomized experiment with four replicate blocks, each with seven restoration treatments at each site. The treatments were: 
1. natural regeneration from cereal stubble; 
2. shallow cultivation + species-poor ESA seed mixture; 
3. shallow cultivation + species-rich NVC seed mixture; 
4. shallow cultivation + species-rich NVC seed mixture + nurse crop; 
5. deep cultivation + species-poor ESA seed mixture; 
6. deep cultivation  + species-rich NVC seed mixture; 
7. deep cultivation + species-rich NVC seed mixture + nurse crop. 
The core of each plot measured 6x4 m with a discard area at one end. The plots were separated by 1-m guard rows. The cereal stubble was left intact for the natural regeneration treatment (1). Shallow cultivation was achieved with harrows or discs depending on the soil type. This was contrasted with deep cultivation to a depth of 30 - 40 cm using a plough, a method that was intended to bury fertile topsoil and the seed bank of undesirable species. A seed mixture designed to create the composition and structure of each NVC target community was made up from commercially available seed of native species. All forb species and the majority of the grasses were of lowland British provenance. These seed mixtures typically comprised between 25 and 41 species, of which 80% by weight were grasses and 20% forbs. The seed rate was between 24 and 28 kg ha. The performance of this species-rich NVC seed mixture was contrasted with that of the more species-poor seed mixture, which was recommended in the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) guidelines for establishing moderately diverse grassland on arable land. This prescription varied slightly between each ESA. Typically it recommended sowing six to eight common grasses at between 20 and 31 kg ha. However, the seed mixture recommended for the South Wessex Downs ESA required the inclusion of nine forbs with the basic mix of eight grass species. Finally, the effect of an annual nurse crop on forb seedling recruitment in the NVC seed mixtures was investigated by sowing the rye-grass Lolium multiï¬‚orum at a rate of 20 kg ha. In the ï¬rst year after sowing the vegetation was cut and removed in early June to prevent the nurse crop from persisting. In subsequent years cutting was carried out in July and the herbage was left to dry for several days before removal to allow some seed return. In all years the aftermath growth was grazed by sheep between October and December at an annual stocking rate of 0Â·4 - 0Â·7 livestock units ha - 1 year - 1 depending on the grass growth. This typically equated to between 25 and 40 sheep ha - 1 grazing for 6 - 8 weeks.  Soil samples were collected from each plot following cultivation in September 1994. Ten samples were taken at random from each plot using a 6-cm diameter and 20-cm deep auger. The samples were split into 0 - 5 cm and 6 - 20-cm depth fractions and bulked. A subsample of around 500 cubic cm was analysed for soil nutrients according to the methodology described by Allen et al. (1974). Soil sampling and analysis were repeated in September 1998. In early June of each year three quadrats were placed at random within each plot, avoiding a 1-m strip around the edge. Each quadrat measured 40x40 cm and was subdivided into 16 10x10-cm cells. The presence of all vascular plants was recorded in each cell. Abundance of each species was expressed as the percentage occupancy of the 48 cells per treatment. Species were classiï¬ed as sown and unsown grasses and forbs. These were summed to provide a measure of plant species richness. both gave identical qualitative results. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The soil of the ï¬ve arable reversion sites contained moderate to large residual amounts of P and K, and in most cases low %N. This is typical of soils with a history of intensive arable agriculture supported by inorganic fertilizers. There is good evidence to suggest that high residual soil fertility places severe constraints on the restoration and long-term maintenance of plant species diversity. Elevated nutrient levels are often associated with high productivity, which enables a small number of more competitive species to dominate the vegetation and exclude other species. However, this project suggests that the establishment of diverse grassland communities may not be constrained by high residual soil fertility on ex-arable land where N is initially in short supply. Monitoring is continuing in order to investigate the effects of elevated nutrient concentrations on the rate and direction of succession in the longer term. Nevertheless, this project has shown that deep cultivation of ex-arable soil can cause a rapid and signiï¬cant reduction in available P and K concentrations in the 0 - 5-cm depth fraction across a range of soil types. It is likely that this reï¬‚ects the burial and dilution of fertile upper layers of the soil with less fertile soil from below. Analysis of individual sites showed that deep cultivation was most effective on shallow chalk soils, where up to 50% reductions in both nutrients were achieved. However, it is important to note that the resultant nutrient concentrations achieved by this treatment were still considerably higher than those typically found in the unimproved grassland target communities. Furthermore, after 4 years P concentrations fell in the shallow cultivation treatments to those achieved by deep cultivation in the ï¬rst year. Also, K concentrations recovered in the deep ploughed treatments so that after 4 years there were no signiï¬cant differences between cultivation treatments. This might be explained by weathering and release of nutrients from the inorganic pool, as well as the mixing of the soil by macrofauna and the redistribution of nutrients by plant roots. It is perhaps surprising that %N declined by a small amount at both depths over the period of the experiment. Several studies have shown N and associated mineralization rates increase during old-ï¬eld succession. However, little is known about soil processes during the early stages of old-ï¬eld succession. It is possible that the rate of assimilation of mineralized N into the rapidly growing perennial vegetation and multiplying soil microbial populations initially exceeds the amount returned by processes such as leaf fall and root excretion. Deep cultivation caused a signiï¬cant reduction in the number and abundance of unsown grass species. Many grasses have a light requirement for germination and therefore need to remain at or near the soil surface to establish. The beneï¬cial effect of deep cultivation on sown forbs may therefore relate to decreased competition from unsown grasses, the short-term reduction in soil fertility, and the improved physical structure of the seed bed. Monitoring is continuing to see whether species richness will be maintained despite these comparatively high nutrient levels. The vegetation communities resulting from natural regeneration and those sown with typical ESA seed mixtures had signiï¬cantly fewer desirable species than the treatments sown with the NVC seed mixture throughout the experiment. This conï¬rms that the creation of diverse vegetation on ex-arable land is highly seed limited and there is little potential for the colonization of later successional grassland species. Sowing a seed mixture (ESA or NVC) led to a decrease in the number and individual abundance of unsown weedy species, but there was no evidence to suggest that sowing a species-rich NVC seed mixture was any more effective in suppressing weedy species than the more species-poor ESA seed mixture. This conï¬‚icts with the ï¬ndings of another multi-site study where high-and low-diversity seed mixtures were sown on ï¬ve ex-arable sites across north-west Europe (van der Putten et al. 2000). Plots sown with 15 species contained fewer ""˜natural colonizer' species than those sown with four 
species. In our experiment the species-poor and species-rich seed treatments were sown with an average of eight and 37 species, of which an average of 8Â·6 and 17Â·9 species established, respectively. The relative similarity in the number of sown species establishing between our species-poor and species-rich treatments may explain the lack of support for the results of the latter experiment. However, these differences were sufï¬cient to cause large differences in productivity between species-rich and species-poor treatments after the ï¬rst year. The plots sown with the NVC seed mixtures provided a source of desirable species to colonize the other plots. This allowed us to determine whether sowing a grass-rich, but forb-poor, mixture, as the ESA mix was, makes the vegetation less susceptible to colonization by desirable forb species compared with the vegetation produced by natural regeneration. This may be a function of species richness but also the fact that the ESA mix contains later successional species than the ruderal-dominated natural colonizers. Thus the former may be less susceptible to colonization by other late-successional species. However, there was no evidence that vegetation produced by sowing the low-diversity ESA seed mixture was any less susceptible to colonization by desirable later successional grassland forb species than the natural regenerating vegetation. A simple measure of restoration success was applied to this experiment, namely a comparison of the composition of the restored vegetation to pre-deï¬ned desirable target communities described by the NVC. However, these communities were originally described from sample stands of high nature conservation value, so they represent an ambitious target for restoration on ex-arable land after 4 years. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The natural regeneration and ESA treatments corresponded poorly to the target vegetation types. This reï¬‚ects the importance of the constraint of seed limitation on community development. The treatments sown with the NVC seed mixtures were reasonably similar in composition to the diverse target communities on neutral soils. Correspondence with the deï¬ned target subcommunities on the acidic and calcareous soils was much lower, reï¬‚ecting the poor performance of the indicator species for these target vegetation types. In order to resemble truly the target ecosystem, a restored system must be similar in terms of the following attributes, which can be considered as measures of restoration success: (i) community structure and composition of all other biota, including non-vascular plants, invertebrates, soil microbiota; (ii) ecosystem function, including measures of nutrient utilization efï¬ciency, retention and cycling, productivity of different trophic levels, community respiration, and water use; and (iii) the maintenance of communities and functions over time (stability, resilience and resistance).

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: This project has demonstrated that the most effective means of restoring diverse plant communities to ex-arable land was deep cultivation followed by the application of a diverse seed mixture comprising ecologically appropriate species. The most important constraint on achieving the assembly of these plant communities was seed limitation: high soil fertility appeared to be a less important constraint, the amelioration of which can have small beneï¬cial effects on the assembly of diverse communities. The establishment of desirable species was not signiï¬cantly enhanced by sowing a nurse crop for amelioration of abiotic and biotic conditions. Overall these treatment effects were found to be reproducible over a range of sites. The NVC proved to be a useful means of tracking the course of vegetation succession towards a pre-deï¬ned target. The success of restoration, as measured by these means, was greatest on neutral soils.
Further research is required to enhance the establishment of species with a preference for calcareous and acidic soils, for this project, monitoring is continuing to ensure that these conclusion are upheld in the longer term. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/argentina-semiarid-rangeland-restoration/	Argentina: Semiarid Rangeland Restoration	Argentina	2001-01-01	2006-12-31	"Restoration of palatable grasses on degraded rangelands dominated by unpalatable grasses in central Argentina is limited by low availability of seeds and safe sites for seedling establishment. The objective of the project was to determine how mechanical disturbance of unpalatable grasses (Stipa spp.) in combination with seeding of a palatable grass (Poa ligularis) inï¬‚uenced species composition in a degraded rangeland excluded from livestock grazing. In April 2001, 10 blocks were uniformly distributed on a previously burned site dominated by unpalatable grasses, and treatments applied in 8 m x 8 m experimental plots. Treatments were “˜disked and seeded’ and control (no disking, no seeding). Perennial plant cover and end-of-season standing crop, at species or species group level, were assessed in December 2002/2003 and in December 2004/2006, respectively. P. ligularis out-competed both tillers of unpalatable grasses that survived mechanical disturbance and seedlings of unpalatable grasses established after mechanical disturbance. The cover and end-of-season standing crop of unpalatable grasses was higher in the control than in the “˜disked and seeded’ treatment, whereas the cover and end-of-season standing crop of P. ligularis was higher in the latter than in the former treatment. The results suggest that a rapid transition from a state dominated by unpalatable grasses to a state dominated by palatable grasses can be achieved by mechanical disturbance of unpalatable grasses in combination with seeding of palatable grasses in semiarid rangelands of central Argentina.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation The temperate semiarid grasslands in this part of Argentina have a history of over 100 years of grazing by sheep and cattle. In the uplands, compositional changes associated with grazing include the replacement of palatable midgrasses by palatable shortgrasses. Under the conditions of long-term, heavy grazing, the seral grasses commonly give way to increasing cover or even invastion by unpalatable grasses. Grazing caused a negative pressure on the palatable grasses, allowing for an increase in the unpalatable grasses, who also had poor litter quality, which is thought to translate into decreased nutrient turnover and reduced soil nutrient availability. In some areas nitrogen and phosophorus availability were 50% to 600% higher in patches dominated by palatable than in patches dominated by unpalatable grasses. The range was dominated by perennial cool-season bunchgrasses, with late seral dominants represented by palatable midgrasses such as Poa ligularis and Stipa clarazii. The subordinate species are mostly palatable shortgrasses like Stipa tenuis, Piptochaetium napostaense along with a much smaller frequency of unpalatable grasses such as Stipa ichu, Stipa tenuissima, Stipa trichotoma, Stipa speciosa, Stipa ambigua, and Stipa brachychaeta. The Caldenal grassland had frequent fires, however, it is thought that the grassland had more frequent occurrence prior to the introduction of livestock ranching and the reduction of fine fuels along with the building of firebreaks. Presently, fires occur naturally once every 10 years. The project intended to conduct a study to assess the potential of mechanical disturbance in combination with seeding to overcome those limiting factors in a degraded grassland excluded from livestock grazing. It was though that (1) disking stands dominated by unpalatable grasses would open safe sites for seedling establishment, (2) Poa ligularis, a late seral dominant palatable grass species, would then readily establish after seeding, and (3) P. ligularis would persist at the site by competitively excluding both remnants tillers of unpalatable grasses surviving disking, and seedlings of unpalatable grasses established after the mechanical treatment.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Grazing has a significant history in this part of Argentina and continues to be essential to the local agricultural economy. The increase of unpalatable species in the rangelands has a negative effect on the livestock economy, so this type of research has been deemed critical to local landholders and ranchers.

Description of Project Activities: In March 2001, the site was burned to eliminate standing dead biomass, and a month later 10 blocks were uniformly distributed on the site. Within each block, two experimental units (8 m x 8 m) were randomly assigned to one of the two treatments: ""˜disking and seeding' and untreated control. Disking consisted of one pass of a 2.65-m-wide disk ripper. Seeds of P. ligularis (60% germination power) were manually spread at an approximate density of 150 seed/sq m. Seeds had been hand harvested from a 30-year-old grazing exclosure located 30 km away from the study site. To determine the effectiveness of the mechanical disturbance, the density of unpalatable grasses was assessed in December, 2002. Measurements were made on four 0.25 m x 6 m randomly located plots within each experimental unit. Density of unpalatable grasses was assessed by counting the number of plants per plot. Seedlings established after disking were differentiated from intact tussocks and tillers that survived mechanical disturbance. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Mechanical disturbance combined with seeding of P. ligularis was markedly detrimental to density, cover and biomass of unpalatable grasses. The most probable reason for the success of the ""˜disked and seeded' treatment was reduced competition from large tussock of unpalatable grasses, combined with adequate soil moisture for seedling establishment after seeding. Both surviving tillers and seedlings of unpalatable grasses were out-competed by P. ligularis. This species posses traits such as the growth of large tussocks, high leaf nitrogen content, high speciï¬c leaf area, high relative growth rate, and low tissue density, which suggest a high potential to compete for resources and become a dominant species.  Although the competitive ability of P. ligularis in particular has not been studied, results from a previous study showed a higher ability to compete for resources in palatable than unpalatable grasses in the system under study. Annual rainfall in the ï¬rst 4 years of the study was close to or above the long-term average (400 mm), which may have contributed to the expression of the competitive ability of P. ligularis. Regardless of wet (2004) or dry (2006) condition, however, P. ligularis contributed the most (88 - 100%) to the end-of-season standing crop in the ""˜disked and seeded' treatment. The replacement of palatable by unpalatable grasses, induced by livestock overgrazing, results in the ecological degradation of rangelands. Unpalatable grasses possess traits such as leaf siliciï¬cation, leaf sclerophylly, large size, and longevity that lead to reduced primary productivity, decelerated nutrient cycling, and decreased plant species diversity. Such ï¬‚oristic changes also lead to economic and social problems because of their negative impact on livestock carrying capacity. Our results show that a rapid transition from a state dominated by unpalatable grasses to a state dominated by palatable grasses can be achieved by mechanical disturbance of mature stands of unpalatable grasses in combination with seeding of palatable grasses. The stability of mature stands of unpalatable grasses mainly originates in their functional ecological traits (e.g., large tussocks that accumulate huge quantities of senescent biomass that decompose slowly), rather than on edaphic conditions. This particularity enhances the probability of success of the ""˜disked and seeded' treatment across sites in the studied grasslands. On the other hand, climate conditions after seeding may be critical for P. ligularis establishment. It is already known that successful establishment of perennial grasses native to central Argentina depend upon adequate soil moisture in fall and winter, which were the prevailing conditions after seeding in 2001. Finally, mechanical damage to the stand of unpalatable grasses seems to be an indispensable part of any restoration treatment because well-established stands of unpalatable grasses have proved to be impervious to invasion by palatable grasses. This, in turn, occurs because the former species easily out-compete seedlings of the latter species. Fires of moderate severity, commonly applied by ranchers in late summer - early fall, would not be an alternative to mechanical disturbance since, under the mild conditions of late summer - early fall ï¬res, the mortality of unpalatable grasses is quite limited.  Pre-ï¬re cover values of unpalatable grasses will be rapidly restored since they show high regrowth capacity after defoliation. In the present study, unpalatable grasses maintained a high density of adult plants in the control after been burnt to eliminate standing dead biomass in March 2001. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The lack of replication in space and time and the omission of main treatments like seeding alone, represented design limitations in the project.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The replacement of palatable by unpalatable grasses, induced by livestock overgrazing, results in the ecological degradation of rangelands. Unpalatable grasses possess traits such as leaf siliciï¬cation, leaf sclerophylly, large size, and longevity that lead to reduced primary productivity, decelerated nutrient cycling, and decreased plant species diversity. Such ï¬‚oristic changes also lead to economic and social problems because of their negative impact on livestock carrying capacity. The results of this project showed that a rapid transition from a state dominated by unpalatable grasses to a state dominated by palatable grasses can be achieved by mechanical disturbance of mature stands of unpalatable grasses in combination with seeding of palatable grasses. The implications of more palatable grasses in the diets of livestock are that the more palatable grasses are higher in mineral and protein content overall.
The results of the project showed great promise to the restoration of more palatable grasses. The important practical implication for the project is the knowledge of the rapid transition from a state dominated by unpalatable grasses to a state dominated by palatable grasses can be achieved by mechanical disturbance combined with seeding. Further research is now the direction in which effort is necessary to determine the implications of restoring palatable grasses on rangeland carrying capacity and also to establish how grazing should be managed for long-term persistence.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-arizona-fort-valley-restoration-project/	USA: Arizona: Fort Valley Restoration Project	United States of America	1996-01-01	2008-06-19	"The Fort Valley Project was an experiment designed to test forest treatments that were intended to restore natural ecological qualities and reduce the hazard of intense wildfire in the urban/wildland interface around Flagstaff, Arizona. The primary goal of the project was the reverse the degradation of ponderosa pine ecosystems by restoring their structure and function along with the natural disturbance regimes that were characteristic of their evolutionary environment. The project is a collaboration between the Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership, the USDA Forest Service (the Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) and the Coconino National Forest), and the Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern Arizona University. The overall project is a landscape-scale restoration project that is being conducted over a 10,000 acre area, with an initial experimental phase that was conducted on 1700 acres.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Mining & Resource Extraction Prior to Euro-American settlement of Flagstaff in the late 1800s, the ponderosa pine ecosystems were considerably more open and park-like in their structure, with a low-intensity, high-frequency fire regime. This fire regime burned through the fine fuels on a regular basis, maintaining the open structure of the forest overstory. The arrival of livestock in the 1880s resulted in the removal of most of the fine fuels found in the forest, causing a disruption of the historic fire regime. Widespread timber harvesting began in the region at the same time, which radically altered the structure of the forest by removing the vast majority of large trees. Institutionalized fire suppression policies gained greater traction after the early 1900s, but fire suppression as a consequence of grazing had already been affecting the ecological trajectory of the forest in the last two decades of the 19th century. In 1917-1919 a series of very wet winters produced a massive increase in the amount of ponderosa seedlings throughout the forest, an event that is cited as the origin of the overstocked forest that is found in the area today. The coupling of fire suppression policies with this massive increase in the stem count of the forest resulted in the massively overgrown forests of today. In some studies, the stem counts were shown to have increased from 42-50 trees per acre to well over 1,000 trees per acre. This overstocked forest contributed to the dangerous fuel levels that were amplified in the periodic droughts that have happened in the region. The explosive rise in the number of catastrophic high-intensity crown fires in ponderosa pine ecosystems is one of the main motivations behind the Fort Valley project, where fire protection for the urban/wildland interface is of critical importance. The associated decline in native biological diversity, declining herbaceous and tree productivity, and the high mortality of old-growth trees were also seen as indicators of declining forest health. Ponderosa pine forests in the southwestern United States evolved with a low-intensity, high-frequency fire regime. This fire regime resulted in a forest of many large ponderosa pine trees spaced widely in the midst of large expanses of grassland that has often been described as park-like. Early Euro-American accounts of these forests describe expanses of grassland that often reached the belly of horses and was depicted as being “˜limitless’. The massive ponderosa trees often reached 30 m tall and some 2-3 m in diameter at the base, and were known to have a wide spacing in which their crowns often did not connect. This open forest supported a range of grasses and forbs in the spaces between trees and it was these fine fuels that carried the low-intensity fires that were common in early summer. The high incidence of lightning strikes in this region particularly in summer, are cited as one of the major causes of fires historically. Some historical accounts indicate that firing of the landscape occurred prior to widespread fire suppression policies of the early 1900s, however, these accounts are anecdotal and have not been tied to specific cultural practices that may have been employed prior to Euro-American settlement. The three primary goals of the GFFP are: 1) restore the natural ecosystem functions, within the range of natural variability, of the ponderosa pine forests in Flagstaff’s Urban Wildland Interface; 2) Manage forest fuels within the Urban Wildland Interface to reduce the rise of catastrophic fire; and 3) research, test, develop, and demonstrate key ecological, economic, and social dimensions of restoration efforts.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership (GFFP) is a collaboration between the Coconino National Forest, Grand Canyon Forests Foundation, Northern Arizona University (NAU), and a number of other governmental and non-governmental organizations. The Partnership is a collaborative effort intended to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire and restore forest ecosystem health through practices that are ecologically sound, economically viable, and socially acceptable. Recognizing the importance of these issues, the Coconino National Forest and the Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership, Inc. (formerly the Grand Canyon Forests Foundation, a private, non-profit corporation) formed the partnership to undertake a series of projects to reduce fire risk and begin the long process of restoring local forests. Restoration plans are developed by the Partnership with the assistance of a Partnership Advisory Board, made up of scientists, local government officials, land managers, business representatives, conservationists, and concerned citizens. The formal Partnership is a cooperative agreement between the Forest Service and the non-profit Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership, Inc., with the Forest Service retaining full decision-making authority over any activities taking place on lands they manage.

Description of Project Activities: The Forest Service and Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership established three experimental blocks (EB1, EB2 and EB3), each consisting of four different treatments, during the summer of 1998 within an approximately 688 ha area (1700 ac) of the Fort Valley Experimental Forest (EB1) and adjacent Coconino National Forest (EB2 and EB3).  Experimental blocks were laid out in cooperation with Forest Service staff, subject to constraints of other experimental studies and wildlife habitat.  Due to these constraints, the treatment units in experimental blocks 1 and 2 could not be contiguous.  All treatments were randomly assigned.  Each treatment unit was approximately 16 ha (40 ac) in size.  Treatment units within each block were randomly assigned one of four treatments, consisting of three levels of thinning intensity, followed by prescribed burning, and an untreated control treatment.  Tree thinning was based on the pattern of tree structure prior to European settlement (""presettlement""), determined by: (1) living trees of presettlement origin, characterized by larger size and yellowed bark, and (2) remnant material from snags, logs, and stumps of presettlement origin, which were well-conserved in the dry environment in the absence of fire.  All living presettlement trees were retained.  In addition, wherever evidence of remnant presettlement material was encountered, several of the largest postsettlement trees within 9.15 m (30') were retained as replacements.  If suitable trees were not found within this distance, the search radius was extended to 18.30 m (60').  The three thinning treatments had different replacement tree densities: (1) 1.5-3 replacements, replace each remnant with 1.5 trees (i.e., 3 replacements for every 2 remnants) if the replacements were 40.64 cm (16"") dbh or larger, otherwise replace each remnant with 3 trees. Since relatively few >16"" postsettlement trees were encountered in any of the sites, all the thinning treatments tended to retain the higher number of replacement.  The 1.5-3 treatment, called ""full restoration,"" reduced tree density most closely to presettlement levels. (2) 2-4 replacements, replace remnants with 2 trees > 16"" dbh, otherwise 4 trees. (3) 3-6 replacements, replace remnants with 3 trees > 16"" dbh, otherwise 6 trees.  (4) Control treatment:  no thinning, no burning. Pre-treatment understory data was collected from August-November 1998, prior to initiation of restoration activities. All three units were then thinned in the fall of 1998 through the spring of 1999. At the outset the project contractors completed the thinning by felling and bucking the trees into logs initially, however a second company utilized a feller/buncher and skidded the trees to a landing where they were de-limbed and topped.  Slash piles that had been piled using a small dozer were burned in the winter of 2000 for all three blocks. EB3 was broadcast burned in April 2000, EB2 was burned in May 2001, and EB1 was burned in May and July of 2001.

Besides collecting understory data in 1998 (pre-treatment), study plots were re-measured in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2006 using belt and point-intercept transects. The point-intercept method uses a 50-m transect laid parallel to the environmental gradient.  The primary objective of the point-intercept transect is to quantify plant foliar frequency, as a surrogate for plant cover/abundance. At every 30 cm increment along the transect, for a total of 166 point measurements, present plant species were recorded (if any) along with substrate (litter, rock, wood, or bare mineral soil).  Plant abundance was determined by dividing the number of first plant hits by 166 points.  Individual species abundance was determined by dividing the number of individual species' hits by the total number of plant hits. A 10 x 50 meter belt transect was also centered over each 50-m point-intercept transect. In each belt transect, all vascular plants present were identified, including trees less than breast height (1.4 m or 55 in), with the objective being to obtain a comprehensive species list of the area.  Researchers did not record any plant cover or substrate data in these belts. Collecting vegetation data using quadrats has been shown to be a superior method compared to the point-intercept method in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. The point-intercept method tends to over-estimate plant cover (due to the inherent difficulty in sampling at a dimensionless point) and underestimate species richness (due to the overall miniscule area sampled). Therefore, in 2006 researchers additionally sampled ten 1-m2 quadrats per plot arranged along the center of the point - intercept transect. They measured species presence and foliar cover (%) to the nearest quarter percent using cardboard cutouts of known sizes as visual guides.  Ocular estimation of plant cover is a commonly used method for determining plant dominance, succession, and treatment response in vegetation analysis.  The estimates can total > 100% because percent cover was estimated independently for each species and independent of canopy position.  The percent cover of litter, rock, wood, and bare mineral soil was also determined for each plot. Plant cover was averaged across the 10 quadrats per plot. Researchers continued using belt transects in 2006 for species richness, and point-intercept transects for consistency in detecting relative changes from pretreatment conditions. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Treated units were consistently found to have higher cover and richness than controls and the responses were correlated in ""stairstep"" fashion with progressively increasing thinning intensity.  Plant cover (%) in the 1.5-3 restoration treatments was over three times greater than in control treatments, five years following treatments. The 2-4 and 3-6 restoration treatment also increased in plant cover 2.3 and 1.8-times, respectively, when compared to control treatments.  Species richness was 74% greater in restoration treatments than control treatments.  On average, there were 15 more species in treated units compared to non-treated units, with slight differences among the treated units.  Overall, researchers detected 162 vascular plant species in 2006 across all treatment units of which 60% were found within control treatments compared to 73% found in the 1.5-3 treatments.
Native plant species (primarily composed of graminoids and perennial forbs) dominated the understory in terms of both abundance and number of species among each treatment: approximately 95% of the total cover and 90% of the herbaceous species in the 1.5-3 replacement treatments were natives.   Squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), sedge (Carex sp.), mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana), Wheeler's thistle (Cirsium wheeleri), and groundcover milkvetch (Astragulus humistratus) were the most common species among treatments.  When evaluating individual species response to restoration treatments, Canadian horseweed (Conyza canadensis), pineland marshtail (Laennecia schiedeana), clammy cudweed (Pseudognaphalium macounii), wild barley (Hordeum jubatum), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and showy goldeneye (Heliomeris multiflora) appeared to respond the most favorably.  Although non-native (introduced) species were scarce and did not differ (p = 0.1258) among treatments in 2006, seven introduced species exhibited frequencies greater than 5 % in the restoration treatments compared to three species in control treatments. Wooly mullein (Verbascum thapsus), Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica), and bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare) occurred the most frequently within restoration treatments, whereas Dalmatian toadflax occurred the most frequently in control treatments.  
 
The understory plant community responded strongly to inter-annual climatic differences, though the change was less apparent in the control treatments. Species richness in restoration treatments varied significantly through time (p <.0001), though it consistently remained higher than pre-treatment levels.  Species richness decreased in all treatments in 2002 and increased in 2001 and 2006. Differences existing among blocks before treatment (especially the much larger old-growth component in Block 1) were reflected in differential responses to the thinning and burning treatments. Changes observed since treatment were more pronounced in understory vegetation within each individual block than at the treatment level.  In general, treatments tended to increase plant cover and species richness, although this effect varied in each individual block.   Changes in plant cover for all three blocks varied significantly with pre-existing differences among treatment units. In Block 3, there were significant differences between treatments with the 1.5-3 treatment having the highest plant cover, followed by the 2-4 treatment.  There were no differences in plant cover between the control and 3-6 treatments, though they were significantly lower than the 1.5-3 and 2-4 treatment units.  Change in species richness between 1998 and 2006 was significantly greater in the 1.5-3 and 2-4 treatment than the control and 3-6 treatments.  Native species were the most prevalent in terms of abundance (92%) and composition (72%). There were increases in introduced species among the restoration treatments, increasing five-fold in species richness in the 1.5-3 restoration treatment, and from well below to just over 1% in plant cover.  Graminoids were the most dominant functional group among all treatments, comprised of approximately two-thirds C3 grasses. Similar differences were evident in Block 1 as well. Plant cover was significantly greater in all three restoration treatments than the control, but we did not find the expected differences among treatments.  Change in species richness increased in general due to treatment effect, however only the 2-4 and 3-6 replacement treatments were significantly higher than the control. Introduced species were rarely found among treatments and graminoids were the dominant functional group.       
  
In Block 2, the overall model that included treatment and pre-existing treatment differences was significant but individual treatment means did not differ significantly (p =0.0626). Plant cover tended to be greater in all three restoration treatments compared to the control.  Change in species richness in Block 2 was only significantly higher in the 3-6 treatment.  Native species were the primary vegetation among all treatments.  Introduced species were infrequent. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Cover of introduced species was fairly low, though some individual introduced species did increase in frequency across the study area. These included Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica), common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare), wooly mullein (Verbascum thapsus), yellow salsify (Tragopogon dubius), prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola), and possibly cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). Several of these species are of management concern, but the total average cover of introduced species did not exceed 0.4% in any treatment and did not exceed 8% of all plant cover in any treatment.  These low values contrast with exotic cover of 15% or more following severe wildfires in some areas of northern Arizona. Introduced species richness as a whole did not increase significantly following restoration treatments, although there was a trend toward more introduced species.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Species richness in Fort Valley did not differ significantly between treatments.  However, the data showed a strong and unexpected trend toward increasing richness in treated areas; Fort Valley had a species richness of approximately 12-20 species per 500-sq m in the control treatments, but 30 to nearly 40 species per 500-sq m in the thinned treatments. A significant difference between these means might have been found if it were not for the low number of replicates. There are some species that were tentatively thought to be positively affected by thinning and burning. Among the biennial/annual forbs, these species include ragleaf bahia (Bahia dissecta), fetid goosefoot (Chenopodium graveolens), goosefoot (Chenopodium sp.), bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare [introduced]), annual willowherb (Epilobium brachycarpum), trailing fleabane (Erigeron flagellaris), pineland marshtail (Laennecia schiedeana), Douglas' knotweed (Polygonum douglasii), yellow salsify (Tragopogon dubius [introduced]), and wooly mullein (Verbascum thapsus [introduced]). Many of these species are in the Asteraceae (composite) family and are wind-dispersed, supporting the hypothesis that early-successional species would be favored in the post-treatment environment. There were no species in this group that seemed to be negatively affected by the restoration treatments. Perennials that appear to be increasing with restoration treatments include common yarrow (Achillea millefolium), small-leaf pussytoes (Antennaria parvifolia), showy goldeneye (Heliomeris multiflora), Bigelow's rubberweed (Hymenoxys bigelovii), Huachuca Mountain morning-glory (Ipomoea plummerae), prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola [introduced]), Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica [introduced]), Lambert's locoweed (Oxytropis lambertii), Flagstaff ragwort (Senecio actinella), and common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale [introduced]). Again, the majority of these species are wind-dispersed members of the composite family and most increases in the presence of these species happened in both treatments and controls. Three species/genera that appear to be decreasing with restoration treatments include mountain goldenbanner (Thermopsis montana), clover (Trifolium sp.) and beardlip penstemon (Penstemon barbatus).  
 
Graminoid species remained relatively stable through time.  Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum [introduced]), Fendler's flatsedge (Cyperus fendlerianus), wild barley (Hordeum jubatum), deergrass (Muhlenbergia rigens), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) appeared to increase with thinning and burning.  There were no species that seemed to be decreasing in frequency with these treatments and no differences were evident between C4 and C3 grasses. Buckbrush (Ceanothus fendleri) increased across the landscape after thinning and burning, while rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa) and Woods' rose (Rosa woodsii) decreased in both treatments and controls. This could be an effect of long-term drought or grazing. Woods' rose is heavily browsed by deer and elk following fire and other species of Ericameria are also eaten by ungulates (FEIS database).  Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) seedlings had a productive year in 2006. They were found in 100% of the treated plots (180 total plots) and 80% of the control plots.  Gambel oak (Quercus gambelli) seedlings have been found in small numbers throughout the duration of the study, but they don't appear to be increasing or decreasing across the landscape.
The Greater Flagstaff Forests Partnership is committed to researching and monitoring the key ecological, economic, and social impacts and issues associated with landscape-scale restoration. The Fort Valley Project in particular includes a $500,000 ecosystem research budget and can count over 20 ongoing studies. The Ecological Restoration Institute has been a leader in providing research capacity for the GFFP and is responsible, along with the Rocky Mountain Research Station and the NAU School of Forestry for the wide variety of studies that are ongoing and concurrent in and around the Fort Valley Project.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/spain-portugal-ecoquarry-ecotechnology-for-environmental-restoration-of-limestone-quarries/	Spain/Portugal: ECOQUARRY – Ecotechnology for Environmental Restoration of  Limestone Quarries	Portugal	2004-09-01	2007-08-31	"ECOQUARRY (LIFE04 ENV/ES000195) was a demonstration project carried out in 11 limestone quarries located in NE-E Spain (Catalonia and Valencia) and South Portugal. Scientific/technical orientation was provided by several academic institutions in both countries. The main objectives were i) to use the best available technologies in quarry restoration in a field scale trial, under Mediterranean climate conditions, ii) to improve restoration interventions, developing standardized quality control processes, iii) to promote the rational and sustainable use of natural resources and an increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide fixation, iv) to transfer processes directly to big and small mining companies.
The project was simultaneously implemented in all the quarries of the consortium: 1) Implementation of pilot plot, to test for the most appropriate herbaceous species for each vegetation zone, increasing the diversity of shrub species (through sowing and plantation) and of their spatial distribution. 2) Quality control: optimizing resources and maintenance (e.g. frequency and dosage of irrigation), monitoring vegetation development. 3) Evaluation of results (effectiveness and efficiency). 4) Establishment of an environmental quality system for restoration (quality protocols, restoration manual).
The main problems resulted from erosion and instability of slopes, poor-quality of supplies (low viability of seeds and seedlings, non-availability of autochthonous species) and non-specialization of workers carrying out the plantations. A severe drought on the first year also limited the actions and the interpretation of results.
The project promoted and demonstrated the use of local materials for substrates, native species, and minimum inputs (especially watering) in the perspective of cost-effectiveness. The handbook “Guidelines for limestone quarry restoration in Mediterranean climate” will provide practical assessment in limestone quarry restoration to the enterprises and technical staff in the cement and aggregate sectors. ECOQUARRY promoted co-operation between the mining sector and the scientists involved, so facilitating the exchange of experiences, and further contacts. Awareness of the relevance of restoration process has raised among quarry technical staff.Mining & Resource Extraction Degradation was primarily driven by limestone extraction, with deep modification of topography and hydrology, as well as vegetation and soil removal. This degradation occurs within relatively small areas, but their proximity to highly valued natural areas explains that the main social concerns are aesthetical and recreational. In areas with high density of quarries, fragmentation of habitats becomes a potential problem. In some cases dust pollution is also a matter of concern for local populations. Mediterranean scrub, dominated by evergreen sclerophyllous shrubs or, in earlier successional stages, by summer semi-deciduous shrubs; in some locations, tree forms were also dominant (Aleppo-pine, holm-oak). The main objectives were i) to use the best available technologies in quarry restoration in a field scale trial, under Mediterranean climate conditions, ii) to improve restoration interventions, developing standardized quality control processes, iii) to promote the rational and sustainable use of natural resources and an increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide fixation, iv) to transfer processes directly to big and small mining companies.
These goals were defined by the scientific partners in the consortium, within the criteria framework of the funding programme (EU LIFE-Environment).

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The project involved 10 extractive companies, with varying restoration experience, all interested in improving their restoration practices. Moreover, the project involved two industrial associations (extractive sector), in charge of the dissemination of results, and a government agency responsible for environmental control and legislation. In this demonstration project, most activities were planned by the scientific partners, according to the limitations presented by the quarry partners, who implemented the pilot-plots.

Description of Project Activities: 1)Implementation of pilot tests  -  preparation of plots (amended vs non-amended substrates); choice and hydroseeding of herbaceous and shrub species (commercial vs autochthonous); choice and plantation of autochthonous woody species (c. 10 species).
2)Quality control  -  testing seed viability; optimizing the frequency and dosage of irrigation (soil water monitoring); monitoring vegetation survival and development.
3)Evaluation of results (effectiveness and efficiency)  -  soil characteristics; plant cover, survival, diversity.
4)Dissemination of activities and results, including quality control protocols, a technical course (held in Barcelona in November 2007) and a restoration guide for Mediterranean limestone quarries. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: More than 50% survival of introduced woody plants in most quarries; adequate herb cover. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Physical instability of substrates (slopes > 30%). Severe drought on the first year after sowing/planting (2005), leading to exceptional plot management actions (e.g. irrigation). Timing of seeding/planting. Use of some aggressive commercial herb species. Competition between herbs and woody plants.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The project affected only very small areas within large quarries, with no direct effect in human well being. However, the improvement of restoration technologies benefits the social perception of mining activities, and provides economic opportunities for companies related to restoration, e.g. local forest nurseries, forest engineering companies, landscapers and environmentalists.
ECOQUARRY has developed a set of pilot restoration projects for limestone quarries under a large diversity of Mediterranean climate and substrate conditions, with the participation of scientists, technical staff of quarry companies, and environmental administrations from Catalonia and Valencia Regions (Spain) and Alentejo (Portugal).
Current (Mediterranean) quarry restoration approaches lacks quality control schemes and is focused on short-term greening of slopes, without a long-term ecological perspective.
The project developed control quality schemes for the various restoration phases with the perspective of recovering functional ecosystems, integrated in the surrounding landscape. Restoration ecology principles have been adopted for designing the minimum and necessary restoration actions to trigger natural succession in the middle term. In this framework, the project has promoted and demonstrated the use of local materials for substrates, native species, and minimum inputs (especially watering) in the perspective of cost-effectiveness. The elaboration of the handbook “Guidelines for limestone quarry restoration in Mediterranean climate” will provide practical assessment in limestone quarry restoration to the enterprises and technical staff in the cement and aggregate sectors.
The project contributed to significantly increase the awareness of quality control relevance in restoration projects for the limestone quarry sector. The direct involvement of mining companies and associations in the project ensured the immediate transfer of its technical achievements to the end users. The involved universities established collaboration contracts with some quarry associations and companies in order to make the follow up of restoration projects in the longer-term, and widen the application of the achievements to other companies in the limestone quarry sector. The cause of degradation (limestone extraction) is no longer expected to affect the pilot areas or their close vicinity (post-extraction areas). No mid-term or long-term monitoring program exists (out of the scope of ECOQUARRY), although it would be of utmost importance; further monitoring will depend on the interest (and economic investment) of each mine company where the pilot plots were installed.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/costa-rica-los-arboles-wet-tropical-forest-restoration/	Costa Rica: Los Arboles Wet Tropical Forest Restoration	Costa Rica	1992-01-01	2008-06-17	"This project originated in 1992 when the Tropical Forestry Initiative purchased land in southwestern Costa Rica, in which four families from the eastern United States purchased abandoned pasture land 10 km from Dominical, Costa Rica to study the potential for restoring mixed stands of wet tropical species to the area. Building on studies that showed promise of fast-growing plantation species for jumpstarting succession in tropical forest restoration, the project sought to measure the success of planting mixed species of native species for forest restoration. The project established a nursery with seeds collected from the vicinity and over five years planted the trees in mixed stands in the pastureland, expanding by 3000 to 5000 trees per year. The range of species utilized gradually grew to include 60 species and nearly 30,000 seedlings.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation The original ecosystem was deforested for timber in the 1950s and then converted to grassland and used as pasture over the next 45 years. While there were remnants of the primary forest around the area, the deforestation widely fragmented the forest. The area was primary forest until the 1950s when it was cleared for timber. After that time the land has been utilized as pasture for low intensity cattle production. This was true for most of the region, where the conversion to pasture happened into the 1960s and 1970s with fragments of primary forest scattered throughout the landscape. The primary forest in this area consisted of lowland tropical wet forest, which was a very complex tropical forest largely determined by its higher rainfall, lower evapotranspiration and low altitude. The central goal of the project was to demonstrate that planting and managing native tree species accelerated successional rates toward the ecological restoration of wet tropical forest. Secondarily, the project sought to develop appropriate tree nursery management and planting techniques for use locally which would also show that restoration was an ecologically viable land use project that benefited the local economy. The project also sought to conduct sufficient monitoring of the project to assess the restoration of ecological functions that resulted form the reforestation efforts. The project was started with the intent to exchange technical and socioeconomic information related to reforestation with local landowners and organizations who were involved in forestry management.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The intention of the project was to show that restoration of a mixed tropical forest could be done and that it would have viable economic benefits for local landowners, while enhancing the ecological functioning of the restored ecosystems. The Tropical Forestry Initiative is a non-profit organization that was formed by eight people of diverse professional backgrounds who shared a concern for the loss of tropical forests. This project emerged out of the desire of this group to demonstrate that forests can be restored by planting and managing native tree species.

Description of Project Activities: Beginning in 1993, the project began by first gathering local seed stock of seven different native hardwood species from remnant patches of tropical forest in the area and on local farms, the project then grew those seeds out at the nursery which was established.  The seeds were germinated in a seed-bed before being transferred to soil in plastic bags of approximately 10cm x 25cm.  After three months about 5000 of these seedlings were planted in the pasturelands at a spacing of about 3m x 3m.  In the scrub these plantings were done at approximiately 4m x 4m or more.  In the subsequent 5 years from this initial planting the number of plantings were expanded by 3000 to 5000 annually, until a total of 60 different species had been used and amounted to nearly 30,000 seedlings.  For the first four years, the seedlings planted in the field required the clearing of competition for about a meter around each tree.  Transects of 750m in length were established in which to sample growth performance of at least 24 specimens of each species that were planted originally.  Trees for measurement were each marked with aluminum tags.  Measurements of height of the first year's plantings has continued on a yearly basis and dbh has been recorded for those species exceeding 10cm after five years. One area that was planted was newly abandoned and a somewhat degraded grass pasture whose aspect was to the northeast. It was planted with seedlings of gallinazo and cedro, among newly established seedlings of mayo Colorado.  Another area was planted into a somewhat degraded pasture that sloped gently north.  It was abandoned five years' previous and was coming up in a scrub species.  After partial removal of this scrub the area was planted with a more complex mixture of seven species""”cenizaro, cocobolo, cristobal, espavel, guanacaste, guapinol, and iguano in the shade of the remnant scrub.

As the young trees developed, researchers measured the tree heights with a telescoping meter bar and later with a laser hypsometer. Tree diameters were measured at breast height (dbh). Researchers measured stand density in 0.1-ha plots, using a modification of the strip plot method described by Wenger (1984). This involved five parallel strips of 25 m X 8 m along a 50-m array within a 30-acre (12-ha) block. Researchers calculated wood volumes for 
Area A using a 0.1-ha plot of the two fastest growing species""”gallinazo and mayo Colorado. For six sample trees of each species, stem profiles were measured using the laser hypsometer combined with a 30-x telescope with a graded reticle and an attached Suunto clinometer. Researchers used the hypsometer to measure the distance to each of five to seven intervals up the stem, and then used the telescope to measure the stem diameter at each interval. From this data, it was possible to determine the average tree profile. For each tree in the plot, the stem volumes were then calculated as the tapered cylinder of the stem defined by the basal area and the height to the first branch. The method is able to measure stem volumes in standing trees.  To estimate the wood volume in the remnant primary forest, we counted all the trees that had a dbh greater than 3.9 inches (10 cm) within a circular area of about 0.5 acres (0.2 ha). Since tree profiles in the mature forest were much too complex to measure, researchers made a rough and very conservative estimate of volumes for each tree using the basal area and a simple tapered cylinder as their model. It was not used to estimate the volume of the branches. Instead researchers used tree density and basal area data a 2001 study of the two nearby remnant primary forests.   For an index of the species diversity, one researcher surveyed the understory plant species at various sites. In that instance the researcher collected and identified tbe understory species that had appeared in planted areas A and B, and, for comparison, the understory species that could be collected in the two primary forest remnants on the same property. She did not count epiphytic species or lianas. Using data from areas A and B, the project found that the average yearly growth in height of gallinazo and mayo Colorado trees was outstanding""”7.2 ft (2.2 m) and 7.9 ft (2.4 m), respectively. These mean growth rates in height are markedly greater than the growth rates for any of the ten native and exotic tree species that a 1992 study recorded in a study of plantation tree plantings in southern Costa Rica. The fast growth rate of these two species results in a rapid crown closure and, it was assumed, a corresponding abrupt microclimate change. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Using data from areas A and B, researchers found that the average yearly growth in height of gallinazo and mayo Colorado trees was outstanding""”7.2 ft (2.2 m) and 7.9 ft (2.4 m), respectively. These mean growth rates in height ate markedly greater than the growth rates for any of the ten native and exotic tree species recorded in a 1992 study of  plantation tree plantings in southern Costa Rica. The fast growth rate of these two species results in a rapid crown closure and, it was assumed, a corresponding abrupt microclimate change.  Cenizaro, Cristobal, espavel, and guanacaste were intermediate in their height growth rate, each with rates of slightly less than 2.9 ft (0.9 m) per year. Iguano, being a shade-loving species, was slower, growing at about 2.3 ft (0.7 m) per year. The data for cocoholo and guapinol were for a shorter time period, although their growth rates seem to be similar to the four intermediate species. Researchers did not systematically measure cedro after the fourth year because attacks by the Hypsipyla budworm became excessive, and many of the cedro trees became malformed or died. The evidence suggests that the project is making progress toward the goal of establishing a primary forest. This evidence can be seen in terms of the tree density, tree height, tree diameter, basal area and volume, and species diversity. Area A has 880 trees/ha, which is somewhat higher than the average tree density of 750 trees/ha in the local primary forests.  A 1997 study reported significantly lower densities for primary forests in the western tropics""”214 to 235 trees/ha. The planted trees have achieved an overall average height of 59.7 ft (18.2 m), neatly two-thirds the height of primary' forest in the neighborhood. Their average dbh of 8 inches (20.5 cm) is about one-third that of the local primary' forests, which is 20.6 inches (52.9 cm). Total basal area of Area A is 31.4 sq m/ha, roughly one-half of the value for primary forests (58.3 m sq/ha). Our estimate of the total wood volume at 32 sq m/ha is about one quarter the estimate for the primary forests, and far below the volumes estimated for Puerto Rico of 145 to 365 sq m/ha. One researcher's 99 understory species indicates aggressive plant succession and increasing bio-complexity under the planted trees. The average count of undergrowth species in two primary forests was somewhat lower at 72 species (not including epiphytes or lianas). A 2004 study also noted that 40 of the understory species in the planted area are common in the local primary forest. These data indicate that the restoration has reached between one quarter and two-thirds of the status of the primary forest, depending on what type of variable is compared.  In the instance of the 2004 study, the estimate of progress in the restoration effort seemed to be reflected in the richness of the understory species in common with the primary forest.  The range of commonality was between 20-33% overall, which may be a reflection of animal-dispersed characteristic, combined with the great abundance of birds and bats to function as dispersal agents.  Wind-dispersed or ejection-dispersed species are much less frequent, but overall the voluntary occurance of man understory species has been surprisingly rapid. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: While the diversity of the restoration is far in excess of the monocultural exotic plantations, or the pastureland, it still has a significant way to go toward recovery of the original levels of biodiversity.  Some estimates of this process peg the timeframe at between 100 and 800 years.  The researchers predict that the relatively rapid of maturation at the outset will gradually slow over time, but after 100 years plantations of mixed tree species may achieve a forest with species composition similar to the primary forest.  Another valid concern is the replacement of historic forestry regimes with more sustainable methodology, so as not to replicate the original injury of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s.  The move toward inclusive community stewardship, coupled with a broad environmental education enterprise makes this move toward more sustainable methods far likelier.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The project was committed to working with local landowners, governmental officials, and schools in an exchange of ideas related to ecological and socioeconomic issues, as well as to promote good will amongst local and foreign-born neighbors. This is an especially important aspect of the work since the Rio Guabo valley and Dominical region have been undergoing a rapid cultural transition due to resort development, improved transportation and communication systems, and access to electrical power. Local landowners and the project worked to establish a forestry association. The goals of the association are centered around promoting reforestation through economic incentives and also to preserve critical habitat. The association's officers and board of directors are all Costa Ricans from the Rio Guabo valley and vicinity. Currently, the association is awaiting legal status, however in the future it will serve as a vehicle for the exchange of technical, economic, cultural and legal information related to forest management.
To assess the recovery of species complexity after planting, a long-term monitoring program has been implemented. The centerpiece of this program is a set of permanent plots in aforestation sites at the Los Arbolos field station. The permanent plot design and monitoring program follow methods modified from the Smithsonian Institution’s `Man and the Biosphere Biodiversity Program’ from Dallmier in 1992. Permanent plots (20 m xô°20 m) were established in representative areas of plantings. Each planted seedling as well as naturally colonizing seedlings and coppice or small trees were identified, mapped, and measured (height and dbh). Additionally, canopy coverage was estimated using a canopy densiometer. Seven of these plots were established on replanted pastures while for comparative purposes, forest composition and structure were measured on nearby old-growth forests using point-quarter transect methods.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/india-chilika-lake-restoration-orissa/	India: Chilika Lake Restoration, Orissa	India	1992-01-01	2006-01-01	"The Chilika Lake, located on the east coast of the state of Orissa, India is the largest lagoon and salt water lake in Asia. It is separated from the Bay of Bengal by a sand bar that varies from 100m to 1.5 km. A long outer channel stretching 32 km connects the main lagoon with the Bay of Bengal. The lagoon spread over an area larger than a 1000 sq. km in the early 20th century, however, during the course of the 20th century the lake shrank to only 760 sq km due to direct reclamation of shoreline areas for agriculture, aquaculture, and human settlements. The Chilika lagoon remains a vital resource for more than 200,000 people in 141 villages who live in around the lagoon. The communities in the Mahanadi river basin subsist on agricultural practices but the villagers around the lagoon area are dependent on aquaculture and the lake’s fisheries for their livelihoods. Construction of hydraulic systems altered the Mahanadi’s flow into Chilika, and the intensification of agriculture in the 20th century has led to numerous problems. Major conflicts began with the alteration of fishing policy and was further exacerbated by big investment that poured into the area from outside the state. This restoration project sought to protect the lake’s ecosystem and biodiversity, mitigate the conflicts, and restore the lake by developing a proposal for integrated resource management around the lake.Agriculture & Livestock, Fisheries & Aquaculture, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry, Other The Chilika lake was spread over 908 sq. km., in the summer and 1165 sq. km., during monsoon in the early part of 20th Century. But by the mid-1980’s the average water spread was estimated at only 790 sq. km., and by late 1990’s it had reduced to 760 sq. km., according to Landsat TM data. This can be attributed to increased reclamation of shoreline areas for agriculture, aquaculture and human settlements. The construction of major hydraulic systems upstream has altered the flow of water into Chilika. The long shore sediment transport along the coast of Bay of Bengal is estimated to be 0.1 million metric tons annually and tends to shift the mouth opening to the sea every year, adversely affecting the tidal exchange. The upstream erosion and sedimentation process in the lagoon directly contributes to the loss of depth of lake bed and also to the choking of the mouth; this in turn led to the decline in salinity which resulted in rapid growth of invasive weed species and macrophytes disturbing the delicate ecosystem of the lake.”¨ In the lagoon area itself, conflict started by changing a basic policy entitling non-fishermen community to use water spread area for traditional culture fishery. Major conflict started when big investment began pouring in from other parts of the state and even from outside the state. The leasing system broke down completely in 1991 when the Orissa government outlined a leasing policy that would in essence have resulted in the auction of leases to the highest bidder. The cooperatives challenged the order in court, and the Orissa High Court directed the Government to make changes that would safeguard traditional fishermen’s interests. Geological studies suggest that the coastline extended along the western shores of Chilika in the Pleistocene era, and that the entire northeastern region above Chilika was under the ocean. Since then, the coastline has moved considerably eastward. For instance, the Konark temple was built on the seashore a few hundred years ago and is now over 3 km from the coast. Most lagoons seen today were formed as a result of a worldwide rise in sea levels over the last 6,000-8,000 years. There was a pause in the rise in sea levels about 7,000 years ago, when a sandy beach formed near the coast and as the sea rose further this sandy beach gradually grew. It progressed seaward and to the northeast, to form what is now the spit of Chilika. A recent fossil from the southwestern edge of the spit has been dated to about 3,500-4,000 years ago, which is some indication of how long ago the lagoon was formed. The growth of the spit at Chilika is thought to be due to the abrupt change in the direction of the coast north of the lake, where strong winds transfer sand to the shore, the longshore drift, and the presence of strong river and tidal currents in these different areas. The spit of Chilika is constantly changing. The sand bar has been widening, and the position of the mouth contantly shifting, moving generally towards the northeast. The mouth was described as being about 1.5 km wide in 1780, and had decreased to half that within forty years. The mouth frequently gets choked up and has to be cut open artificially, often by the local fisherfolk, whose livelihood depends critically on maintaining an access for the sea to enter Chilika. Meanwhile, the former seabed underlying Chilika is gradually silting up because of the rivers running into it, converting the lagoon to its present shallow state. The lagoon is a unique assemblage of marine, brackish and fresh water eco-system with estuarine characteristics. It is one of the hotspots of biodiversity in the region and shelters a number of endangered species listed in the IUCN red list of threatened species, as well as being designated a Ramsar site. It is significant avian habitat and the wintering ground for more than one million migratory birds. The highly productive lagoon eco-system with its rich fishery resources sustains the livelihood of more than 150,000 fisher folk who live in and around Chilika. The area of the Lagoon varies between 1165 to 906 sq. km during the monsoon and summer respectively. The total number of fish species is reported to be 225. Along with a variety of phytoplankton, algae and aquatic plants, the Chilika region also supports over 720 species of non-aquatic plants (CDA). A survey of the fauna of Chilika carried out by the Zoological Survey of India in 1985-87 recorded over 800 species in and around the lagoon. This includes a number of rare, threatened and endangered species, including the Barakudia limbless skink. Chilika is an extremely productive environment due largely to the high nutrient input from surrounding rivers, as well as efficient nutrient re-cycling. This high productivity supports fisheries for both fish and shell fish. Chilika is an ephemeral environments (on geological time scales) and is evolving rapidly into other types of semi-aquatic, habitats (marshes, swamps). Simultaneous with this succession is a gradual shift from high salinity conditions to freshwater. The restoration of the Chilika Lake started with the following basic objectives: 1) To restore the ecological balance of the lake; 2) Provide continued livelihood to the villages surrounding the lake/lagoon.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The basic approach adopted for restoration was to facilitate a community based co-management system for an integrated terrestrial and aquatic resource management program, with a major emphasis on capacity building at the community level. This was done through a series of training and exposure visits, designed to pave the way for preparation of a watershed plan that blended indigenous knowledge at the community level for optimum utilization of the natural resources and an increase in the area’s productivity. The increase in the productivity level is also helping in the poverty alleviation in the catchment area. The watershed community also shares part of the cost of the treatment. This is creating an enabling situation for the local community to make decisions for natural resource management within the catchment basin. There are 8 micro watersheds covering an area of 1000 sq kms and include more than 52 villages.”¨The network of the NGOs and CBOs, wide stakeholders consultation, watershed associations are some of the positive elements in the participatory management approach adopted by CDA. The self-initiated sustainable practices are an indication of the confidence that has been regained by the stakeholders on the lagoon ecosystem.

Description of Project Activities: The spatial and temporal salinity gradients that exist in Chilika give it the unique characteristics of an estuarine eco-system, which exercises a continuous and selective influence on its biota. The transformation of the lagoon towards a fresh water ecosystem was considered as a potential threat to its unique ecosystem. To address this problem, CDA commissioned the services of the premier institutes of the country like National Institute of Oceanography, (NIO) to study the wave climate of the inlet, long shore sediment transport along the shore and the bathymetry of the lead channel. The Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS), carried out the hydrological and two dimensional mathematical model studies. The studies concluded that the tidal influx into the lagoon was considerably reduced because of the shoal formation along the lead channel and continuous shifting of the mouth that resulted in significant hydraulic head loss. 
 
Opening of a new mouth""¨ 
Following the recommendations of the CWPRS, an artificial mouth was opened on 23rd September 2000, which reduced the length of the outflow channel by 18 km. This is considered historic for restoration ecology.  Desiltation of the lead channel was completed before opening the new mouth. The environment impact assessment and the monitoring of the lagoon ecosystem were carried out by National Institute of Oceanography, before and after the intervention. Monitoring results indicated that there is a marked improvement in the lagoon ecosystem.

The other components of the restoration program were community-based treatment of the catchment on a micro watershed basis, restoration of Nalabana bird Sanctuary and improvement of bird habitats with the active participation of the community. Awareness campaigns and environmental education, development of a visitor center, improvements of communication network, close monitoring of the lagoon and a research center on wetland management.
 
The opening of the artificial mouth and the desiltation of the lead channel not only rejuvenated the lagoon ecosystem but also immensely benefited the fisher folk whose average annual income increased by more than 50,000 rupees per annum per family. Overall, the restoration has resulted in the desired improvement of the salinity regime of the lagoon. Marked improvement in the fishery resources of the lagoon as the gradual reduction in the salinity from the lagoon mouth to the lagoon proper after the opening of the mouth is providing the desirable sense of direction for the eurohaline forms to enter into the lagoon from the sea. This is facilitating the auto-recruitment of the fish, prawn, and crab juveniles into the lagoon resulting in a remarkable improvement of the fishery resources. The fish landing, which had declined on an average to a mere 1600 metric tons (MT) during the year 2000-2001 improved to 4889.21 MT and in the seven months after the opening of new mouth i.e. from October 2000 to March 2001 alone was 3718.44 MT. During the year 2001-2002, it recorded to be 11988.88 MT. It registered an all time high record of 14,053.22 MT during 2003-04. The fish landing is recorded to be 13,260.37 MT during 2004-05. It is registered to be 12224.91 MT during 2005-2006. The crab landing which dwindled to a low of 10 MT in 1999-2000 improved to 161.89 in 2004-2005. During the year 2005-2006, total prawn landing was registered to be 4296.02 MT and Crab landing was recorded to be 154.08 MT. This has facilitated the self-initiated good practices by the community like regulation of the mesh size, ban on juvenile poaching etc. Due to improvement of the salinity gradient there is a phenomenal decrease of the fresh water invasive species by 172 sq kilometers and improvement of the sea grass bed. The improvement of the tidal flux has resulted in the better flushing of the sediment to the sea through the outlet channel. There is a significant improvement in the water level variation during the tidal cycle, which has turned the lagoon in to pulsing mode, thus making it more productive by nourishment with additional nutrient and flushing out of the detritus and waste products efficiently. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: There have been remarkable changes in the ecosystem of the Chilika Lake since the restoration process was initiated. The major achievements were: 
1. Salinity Change: Salinity level in the northern sector changed from 0.5  -  2.5 ppt recorded in the last decade to 0.1-36.00 ppt.
2. Fishery productivity : The fish land, which had declined to 1600 MT before intervention changed to 11,877 mt in 2001-2002 and crab landing increased from 3 MT in 1994-95 to""¨150 MTs in 2002-03. There is also a marked change in ranking order.
3. Auto recruitment of fish, prawn and crab: The fish and crab landing data further indicate the significant level of increase in auto recruitment from the sea into the lake after intervention. The shrimp species Paenaus indicus alone showed a record yield of 438 MT, which is higher than any other figure in the last decade.
4. Decline in weed infestation : The trend of invasive fresh water species reaching an area of 523.01 sq. km., in 2000 (October) leaving an weed free area of 333.82 sq. km., was greatly changed following a reduction of 172 sq. km., of weed spread area.""¨ ""¨
5. Depth of Channel: The opening of mouth and consequent changes in tidal flux led to significant flushing of sediment from the channel thereby increasing the depth to 30-45 cm level.

Apart from ecological improvements the other social impacts from this restoration were: 
1) Changes in local community income: lake restoration resulted in enhanced fish and crab yield thereby increasing the per capita average annual income by 50,000 rupees. 
2) Improved stakeholder awareness: the stakeholders have self adopted good practices like regulation of mesh size, discouraging juvenile catches.""¨
3) A better linkage has been established between CDA and fisher community following implementation of action plan.""¨
4) Overall improved Chemical, Physical and Biological parameters

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The hydrological interventions taken for the restoration of the lagoon have resulted in considerable improvement of its fishery resources, water quality, positive impact on the biodiversity and an overall improvement of the ecosystem of the lagoon. This has significantly contributed towards the increase in the per capita income of the community who depend on the lagoon for their livelihood. The increase in the productivity level both in the wetland as well as in the watershed due to the good environmental practices has facilitated the economic improvement of the community. The community participation, linkage with the various national and international institutions, intensive monitoring and assessment system are some of the uniqueness of the management practices adopted by CDA for restoration of this unique wetland. The restoration approach of CDA is considered as most appropriate and unique in the history of restoration ecology. Ramsar Advisory Mission, based on their assessment of the the management interventions, have recommended for removal of Chilika lagoon from the Montreux record. Chilika Development Authority is also conferred with prestigious Ramsar wetland Award-2002, in view of its outstanding achievements in the field of restoration and wise use of the wetlands, as well as the impressive way in which local communities have been involved in these activities.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/india-seva-mandir-natural-resource-restoration-in-rajasthan/	India: Seva Mandir, Natural Resource Restoration in Rajasthan	India	1966-01-01	2008-05-31	"Founded in the 1960s, Seva Mandir (SM) is works in 626 villages of Rajasthan State to help the poor change their circumstances of deprivation. The population is largely tribal with a large dependence on natural resources, especially the local forests and water bodies. Critical problems facing these communities include degraded forests and pastures, recurrent droughts, and soil erosion that leads to widespread livelihood insecurity. Seva Mandir works with individuals, families, and communities to satisfy their basic needs, while serving as a pioneer in initiating the Joint Forest Management Program which allows local communities to initiate protection and management of state owned forests. Seva Mandir reaches some 70,000 households and approximately 360,000 people. Their restoration work emerges from intensive exploitation and deforestation and the consequent high levels of soil erosion, which has lead to a decline in productivity. Land use changes including changes in the nature of ownership and management have begun to move away from traditional resource sharing norms. The widespread exploitation and encroachment on traditionally used land has led to the work of Seva Mandir which seeks not only to restore land but also to restore communities.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation, Other Over the last several decades the natural resource base has been under intensive exploitation which has led to large-scale deforestation along with substantial levels of soil erosion and the deterioration and general decline in productivity. Additionally, recent decades has seen demographic changes which have led many in these communities to seek out migrant labor to fulfill basic needs. Recent decades have also seen changes in the nature of ownership and management of these lands, away from traditional community-based systems of resource sharing toward more privatized forms which has resulted in more degraded, treeless lands. Arbitrary boundary demarcations, resource depletion and increasing pressures from internal and external markets have put strains on the traditional resource sharing mechanisms in the region. The Indian state has largely failed to support commonly held resources, instead providing the rich and more powerful with opportunities to appropriate formerly common resources. The fragility of the resource base has deepened the community dependence on the natural resource base, creating the conditions for over-exploitation out of the sheer survival instinct. The ecosystems of the Aravalli range of hills in Southern Rajasthan is characterized by low rainfall and high temperature. The area is sub-tropical semi arid temperate forest. Traditionally, the natural resources in the were utilized for the bulk of the local communities’ livelihood ranging from agriculture, animal husbandry, to traditional forest uses and pasturage of animals. This allowed for the use of the land to provide for a diversity of useful timber and non-timber products, including grains, pulses, fruits, milk, meat, and eggs. The Aravalli hills are a humanized landscape, lands have been heavily impacted for thousands of years making it impossible to discern pre-disturbance conditions outside of these previously sustainable community systems. To evaluate the project it is instructive to consider the condition of these communities. First, most families own some agricultural land (less than 1 hectare, on average) and are able to cultivate at least one crop per year. The main copping season is kharif (directly after the monsoon), in which the major crop is maize although a small proportion of farmers also cultivate a range of pulses. Annual crop rotation is uncommon. Some farmers, particularly those who are able to access irrigation but also those who have sufficient residual moisture in their fields, are able to take a second crop during the rabi season, wheat, often intercropped with gram or mustard, being the preferred cropping pattern. Less than 20% of the total area under cultivation is under some form of irrigation. An even smaller proportion of these farmers, and strictly under irrigated conditions, is able to take a third crop in the zaid season, consisting of vegetables, chillies, yam, turmeric, ginger and some fibre crops. These are important cash crops and are sold in markets in Udaipur and Gujarat. Overall, however, crop yields in Udaipur district are amongst the lowest in the state, suggesting that there may be considerable untapped potential for strengthening local agricultural livelihoods. Secondly, livestock density in Udaipur district is the highest in the state, with 88% of households being involved in animal husbandry. Most families own a few goats, sheep and a smaller number of cows, bullocks or buffalos, generally of a non-descript breed. The larger animals are used primarily for their contribution to agriculture in the form of manure and draft power. Milk and milk products from buffalos, cows and goats are largely consumed within the household. The scarcity of fodder and the poor quality of livestock lead to low productivity, thus limiting the viability of marketing. Sale of animal products remains minimal although sale of animals, especially goats, constitutes a critical part of local drought coping strategies. Thirdly, the Udaipur region has few marketable local crafts. As a result, there are scant village-based options for generating income. Non-farm livelihood options, however, particularly in the form of manual labour, form a critical component of the livelihood base, typically contributing to more than half of a household’s livelihood needs. A study conducted in 2003 revealed that the average annual income (including the value of agriculture and livestock production used for home consumption) of households in rural Udaipur district is around Rs.16,450, of which 24.2% comes from agricultural production and 19.4% from animal husbandry. While non-farm business and regular salaried employment are the major sources of income for the wealthiest 10%, the vast majority of the population is dependent on daily and seasonal migration for the larger share of their income. Finally, many young men and women, sometimes with their families, migrate to nearby cities and neighbouring states seeking opportunities for wage labour. Daily and seasonal migration has touched almost every family in the region. Many people work in the stone and marble mines of the state, often in deeply exploitative and hazardous health conditions. This also causes dislocation of family units and has a significant impact on the education and well-being of children. A recent study conducted in Seva Mandir’s work area revealed that almost 30% of adolescents migrate for labour for at least some part of the year and that, in doing so, they expose themselves to exploitative and high-risk work conditions, with female adolescents being particularly vulnerable. Especially women, who have always played a vital economic role through their domestic responsibilities, today are increasingly responsible for agricultural work and earning income through migration labour. Although increased representation in the labour force could be taken as a positive sign of women’s empowerment, the fact that real poverty is driving this trend suggests otherwise. Women tend to end up with dangerous jobs that are insecure, poorly-paid and offer little or no social security, generally faring worse than their male counterparts.
Seva Mandir targeted three specific areas for their work: Empowering People’s Insititutions, Strengthening human capabilities, and Strengthening livelihoods. The first area worked with communities to develop their governance and management capacity. The second area developed women’s groups, self-help groups, set up women’s resource centers, involved themselves in education centers on issues such as pregnancy health to children’s literacy, to health work and youth resource centers. The final area focused on ecological work that focused on plantation and pastureland development, watershed development, lift irrigation and waterharvesting, forest land protection, and the extension of irrigated agricultural land. This case study focuses on this ecological work.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
While the Indian state has shown consistent support for outside interests, Seva Mandir sought to work on multiple levels, to support not only the community interests but also at the individual family level. The distortions of political policy on the ground abetted further encroachment on these lands and also limited both the physical lands available and the capacity of the community to work in a cohesive fashion. Seva Mandir sought to not only improve the access of these communities to common lands but to improve the organizational capacity of these communities to tackle the complexities and confusions of their situation.

Description of Project Activities: Natural resource development has been one of Seva Mandir's longest standing programmes. In the early days, the focus was on developing individual wastelands since this was the easiest work and prepared communities for further discussion on common resources. Work on water resources was confined to anicuts (small masonry dams). The physical activities associated with these interventions provided direct, short-term benefits to people in the form of employment in addition to a stream of benefits in the form of fodder, fuel, crop production, and various ecological services. Gradually, this work led to an increased awareness at the community level of the importance of planting trees on degraded lands. In the Second Comprehensive Plan (1994-1999) the emphasis of work on wastelands shifted to group treatment, thereby imbuing ideas of collective action and making viable the treatment of even small areas of land. Gradually a number of common pasture sites were also enclosed and protected. The importance of addressing the overall land situation was soon recognised and the programmes scope expanded to address forestland more systematically. The appearance of Joint Forest Management made this easier. Coupled with a new emphasis on an integrated approach to watershed development, which entailed the preparation of micro-plans, this opened space for community identification of priorities. This placed a focus on governance structures and water resource development to make agriculture more productive. Accordingly, a range of specific governance bodies (forest protection committees, watershed development committees, lift irrigation committees) were created at the village level and the assistance of village level paraprofessionals was tapped. The integration of all villages at the community level was adopted as a key strategy to ensure a more sustainable and profound impact of the program. At present, core areas of work include afforestation, soil stabilization and erosion prevention, implementation of Lift Irrigation Systems, protection and management of pasturelands, construction of anicuts (small dams), and watershed management.  The organization is also involved in the government-supported Joint Forest Management program, which encourages local communities to become involved in the protection and management of forests. It is hoped that these efforts, which consider land as the cornerstone of people's livelihoods, will result in not only increased productivity but also enhanced social solidarity. Given the heavily degraded condition of both private and common grazing lands in Seva Mandir's work area, ensuring the protection of these tracts under the appropriate community, group or individual management contributes directly to their increased productivity and the overall ecological stability of the region. Seva Mandir's afforestation and pastureland development programme is its most mature effort and includes both work on common lands and work on private lands. The organisation places a particular emphasis on common lands since these tend to cover a larger area, are effective rallying points for collective community action and are of greater importance to the more vulnerable sections of the population. Work undertaken on grazing lands includes fencing, soil and water conservation activities, digging pits, plantation and re-plantation, weeding and hoeing, and protection and management. By the end of the fifth comprehensive plan period, around 818 hectares of barren land will be afforested.
Integrated watershed development
Integrated watershed development is a critical dry-land development activity in the region. The primary objective of this program is to increase soil and water conservation, thereby increasing the productivity of the land. The integrated approach is initiated with soil and water conservation across the watershed, from the upper reaches to the lower reaches. Subsequently, plantations, grazing lands and various water management interventions are introduced. Community members undertake all the physical work, work is coordinated by their GVC.  It has been planned to treat 1920 hectares of land under this programme by the end of the Fifth Comprehensive Plan.
Forest Management
Forest plantation and protection
To address the severe degradation of forest lands, Seva Mandir brings communities and the state together through the Joint Forest Management scheme (guidelines issued in 1990), which involves local people, organised into Forest Protection Committees, in protecting and managing their forestlands in collaboration with the Forest Department. In return, communities are entitled to usufruct rights over Non Timber Forest Produce, fodder, fuelwood and a share of harvested timber. To date Seva Mandir has initiated work on some 15 JFM sites covering a total area of around 715 Ha. The Fifth Comprehensive Plan will entail continued efforts to bring more forest under community management through the JFM scheme. Since more than 24% of the forest lands in Seva Mandir's work area are under encroachment, an important element of the forest management interventions is to build institutional capacity at the community level for resolution of these encroachments through negotiation and persuasion. An Environment Fund has been established to support the village communities in their efforts at resolving these conflicting claims around the use of these lands.
In addition to this work, the following activities form a critical component of forest protection: preparation of micro-plan and its approval from the forest department, survey and fencing, soil and water conservation activities, digging pits, plantation, re-plantation, weeding, hoeing, direct seeding, cultural operations, and protection and management. It is envisaged that 1280 Hectares of forest land will be treated under the JFM scheme. 
Rainwater Harvesting Structures
Seva Mandir works with communities to construct rainwater harvesting structures (known as anicuts). These structures, essentially small dams, store rainwater over the course of the monsoon months and make it available for community use during the summer. Although the construction of anicuts was originally initiated primarily to provide a perennial source of drinking water for livestock and to increase soil moisture retention, anicuts are now also seen as playing an important role in increasing agricultural productivity, including the provision of irrigation. In addition, anicuts serve a number of domestic and recreational purposes and offer scope for upgradation to fisheries. Key activities undertaken in the construction of anicuts include: selection of potential sites along with the local community, technical survey of potential sites, meetings with village communities and organising participatory rural appraisals, designing structures in consultation with the local community, baseline survey of water levels in the zone of influence, and working out community systems for management of the facilities, including sharing of water and maintenance. It has been proposed to create 6 anicuts during the Fifth Comprehensive Plan.
Irrigation systems
The installation of Lift Irrigation Systems (LIS), which consist of either electric or diesel pumps installed on wells and linked to fields through various pipes and distribution chambers, has become an important livelihood intervention. At present Seva Mandir has worked with communities to establish 27 such systems. The LIS provide farmers whose land lies in the catchment area with access to irrigation for up to three seasons in the year, subject to availability of and demand for water available in the well. A village level management system is created and operated by a committee to ensure that there is an equitable distribution of water amongst the participating families. In general, lift irrigation systems are only established in those locations where comprehensive land treatment has been undertaken. 4 LISs will be established over the course of the Fifth Comprehensive Plan.
Drinking Water Facilities
Whilst Seva Mandir has addressed issues of drinking water in the past, it has done so primarily during periods of severe drought. Accessibility of drinking water, however, continues to present problems in a number of areas, particularly during the driest months of the year. As such, an important and somewhat new part of the natural resource management programme will involve building the capacity of village institutions to design, implement and maintain community drinking water supply systems. This will entail three major components: (i) taking advantage of relevant government schemes (e.g. Swajaldhara Scheme); (ii) on a need basis installing, repairing and training people to repair hand-pumps; (iii) facilitating the storage of drinking water or roof-top rainwater harvesting structures, according to the feasibility of the site. This new area of emphasis will help Seva Mandir to promote a more holistic approach to water management at the community level. In addition to this, it will cater increasingly to the needs of women.
Agricultural Extension and Animal Husbandry
The productivity of agricultural systems are largely dependent on the quality of the natural resource base, the depth and nutrient content of the soil, the availability of moisture. As such, Seva Mandir pursues agricultural extension primarily in those areas where comprehensive land treatment has been initiated, the main objective being to generate economic benefits from the ecological restoration of the natural resource base. In addition to this, efforts will be made to systematically address issues of livestock health and production through various cattle camps and extension exercises. The above activities will be tailored according to the conditions under which agriculture is being practiced. Two major categories of agricultural development will be addressed: (1) irrigated; and (2) un-irrigated. Under irrigated conditions, largely those sites where lift irrigation systems have been installed, a range of activities including horticulture, vegetable cultivation and vermicompost are being introduced. In addition to this, systematic efforts will be made to facilitate the transfer of non-input-intensive production technologies from research centres to farmers. Under un-irrigated conditions, which constitute by far the greatest proportion of agricultural activity, linkages with agricultural research and extension agencies will also be pursued with a thrust on enhancing the productivity of field crops, exploring opportunities for enhancing the productivity of marginal lands through horti-pasture activities and enhancing livestock production practices according to dry-land conditions. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: While addressing the acute degradation of the natural resource base, both to restore ecological stability and enhance the productivity of the natural resource base remains paramount, Seva Mandir's work on livelihoods extends beyond these issues. It is now clear to Seva Mandir that the issue of property relations has to be addressed.  Without this, people will not be able to gain autonomy and agency to build solidarity for collective action. Natural resources, Seva Mandir has learned, have immense social value.  They serve as a locus for creating greater social cohesion and community empowerment in the villages and are not merely economic assets. In addition to this, it has been found that natural resource based interventions have other returns such as improvements in children's education status and more favourable terms of migration (i.e. a reduced prevalence of distress migration).

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The focus of the program had been on placing greater emphasis on the implementation of physical interventions, resulting in large swathes of land being treated under dry land management, watershed development, and forest management. While these efforts have proved challenging, where they have been successful they have contributed profoundly to transformation within the community, leading to greater cohesion and the recognition of interdependence. As these efforts have matured, the program has started shifting increasingly towards enhancing the productivity of these natural resources and linking them more closely to people's livelihood systems. The future work of the Natural Resource Development program will build on this transition, helping villagers to use both created and restored natural resources, from irrigation systems to pasturelands, to live their life in a more secure and dignified manner.
Seva Mandir’s primarly work will continue to be on common lands and to build community solidarity through this work. At least 50% of the work on land is proposed to be on common lands. Securing collective entitlements is understood to be a critical element. Work on establishing clear property rights, including the resolution of illicit privatisations of public lands through negotiations at the community level and work towards the implementation of Joint Forest Management, pastureland and watershed development programmes. There will also be work towards increasing community access to natural resources for optimising development benefits in an equitable manner. Finally, it is essential to enhance the capability of village institutions and their federations, to implement and sustain work on natural resources for higher economic returns as well as inform the dialogue on issues and concerns around natural resources at the policy level.

Mining is the greatest threat to forests in Tipuani because of the amount of lumber needed to structurally support the mine-shafts that are carved into hillsides or mountains for subterranean mining. In Guanay, commercial timber harvesting and agriculture, especially annual rice cultivation, are all causing deforestation. Trópico’s efforts seek to mitigate these threats by restoring degraded areas using native species and species from plantations. Agroforestry systems with cacao and the sustainable use of the milpesos palm (Oenocarpus bataua) are promoted, and local environmental issues related to the sustainable forest management are addressed. Environmental education has also been successfully incorporated into the project through committees comprised of teachers interested in guiding the population towards a sustainable future.Deforestation, Fragmentation, Mining & Resource Extraction Small scale gold mining is an important source of income for communities in this region of Bolivia and Peru. The local communities have gold mining cooperatives organized out of 50-500 people which are extracting gold from underground and open mines which require a constant supply of wood for pitches and supports for underground work, while open mines cause extensive degradation and deforestation, albeit on a smaller scale. This area of Bolivia is in lower montane rainforest near the Apolobamba Biosphere Reserve. Apolobamba is a highly diverse reserve encompassing over 480,000 hectares, protecting a remarkable altitudinal gradient along the eastern slope of the mountains. The lowland area near Tipuani receives high levels of precipitation and is often covered in fog. The area has very high numbers of endemic species, with typical Amazonian influences seen in genera such as Parkia, Hevea, and even Bertholletia excelsa. The vegetation in this part of the tropics is largely rainforest, but with some areas of drier forest in the valleys and deciduous trees with a dense cover of epiphytes. The forests are associated with red soils of very low levels of fertility, although the native forests have high levels of diversity and are rich in endemic species. The overall strategy of the project was to develop a model to implement the existing environmental laws in Bolivia that require ecological restoration upon the closure of mines, although those laws are largely ignored. The project originally intended to reforest 37 acres (15 hectares) with 40 species of trees, the majority of which are native. Secondarily, the project sought to raise awareness in the population about deforestation, reforestation, and other environmental issues as a way to use their acquired experience to extend the range of the project to the whole municipality of Tipuani and provide incentives for similar activities in areas with the same characteristics. The education of the populous would also help to ensure the continuation of the project beyond the three years of promised funding. Finally, the project had as a goal to promote the sustainable management of natural resources, especially through the implementation of agroforestry systems and the sustainable use of milpesos palm (Oenocarpus bataua).

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The funding for this project came from Conservation International and its grant program, the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund, which placed Conservation International in the position of shaping the original concept of the project. The project was developed and administered by Trópico (Asociación Boliviana para la Conservacíon) which is responsible for developing the model for implementation of the restoration project. Part of the uniqueness of the project was that it involved local stakeholders as project collaborators, stressing cooperation. The first year focused on selecting suitable tree species that the community wished to have and after that phase the local community took ownership of the project. Involving a local staff was a great part of the success of the project.

Description of Project Activities: The project approached the problem in a strategic fashion, never intending to stop mining, but rather to encourage locals to earn their livelihood over the long term with work on tree farms.  They approached the problem by wanting to establish not only a firm foundation of functional resources and programs for the actual restoration work, but also by establishing a scientific and educational foundation for the project.  The project started by identifying more than 200 tree specimens for use in the project, using botanical specimens and techniques for the recovery of degraded areas, as well as preparing a soil use map of the region to identify critical areas.  The project then established a nursery with 30,000 seedlings of 50 fruit and timber species. The project created a pilot platation of 49 acres in San Juanito-Riconada area with native and plantation species  for the Cotapampa, Chiquini, Taniplaya, and Guanay communities.  A total of 124 acres were planted in the course of the project.  

Next, the project established a broad educational program, first by raising awareness in the mining cooperatives about deforestation and erosion through environmental education workshops.  The project established a reforestation and agroforestry systems module in Guanay, while training 200 people in reforestation and agroforestry techniques.  In conjunction with this work, they developed innovative techniques for the sustainable management of the most important non-timber resource of the area, the milpesos palm, in 14 communities.  In coordination with the school district, the project worked on an extensive environmental education program that included the formation of environmental education committees.  These committees carry out activities such as campaigns to combat fires, the planting of trees in schoolyards, collecting and recycling garbage, and holding contests and festivals with environmental themes.  They also helped to develop an environmental education guide for Tipuani teachers.  

Finally, the project worked closely with community leaders to obtain local input on the Tipuani and Guanay municipal plans, as well as creating a document for planning conservation activities in both Tipuani and Guanay.  The project was able to replicate its experience by working with other communities, working through Trópico and other NGOs.  The project has been most successful in establishing the continuity of itself by the commitment of the local staff, as well as securing small donations to help fund and continue work with other local projects. 
Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The mining cooperative system is characterized by great social instability.  The exploitation of gold is closely linked to a short-term mindset and involves the constant migration of people from one place to another because they are dependent on the discovery of metals.  In these areas it is unrealistic to work on the closure of the mines and eliminate the source of the deforestation and degradation because the local communities utterly depend on the income from the mines. One broader social strategy that was learned through the project was that in those areas with social instability it is best to prioritize environmental education with small pilot projects that create favorable conditions for regional projects. Reforestation in these areas proved to be extremely challenging because of the degraded conditions and because of the seedling growth and the support from the mining cooperatives.  The project identified that experiments need to be carried out over a number of years to identify species that do not need very fertile soils, that grow fast, and that produce significant organic material. The distinction that the project discovered that needed to be made was that there is a difference between the recovery of degraded areas where there is no natural secondary growth and precious wood plantations that require areas with relatively good soil.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The project created the conditions in these communities to shift the basic economic realities that drive the degradation in the first place.  By providing a long-term solution that improved the lives of locals, as well as education to support those efforts, the project established a viable alternative to the short-term nature of gold mining which local communities now recognize as being dangerous to their health and well-being.  Given the dangers associated with mining, such as landslides from deforestation, local communities were able to connect the well-being of their forests to the well-being of their communities.
The project learned early on that they needed to plant for the medium and long-term when developing a project that will span many years, especially reforestation projects. Additionally, the project learned that flexibility is critical in the development of the project. That flexibility allowed for project managers to work on issues that interested the population and that could be realistically addressed. By requesting the participation of local stakeholders and developing a local staff expanded the ability to address those issues important to the local communities. Working with organized communities and those institutions already in place expanded the capacity to provide continuity to the project, which was the main criteria in selecting the target area for the project. It was seen as best to pay attention to the selection of local partners. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/colombia-dry-montane-dwarf-tropical-forest-restoration/	Colombia: Dry Montane Dwarf Tropical Forest Restoration	Colombia	2000-05-01	2004-08-31	"This project evaluated a restoration experiment of late-successional dwarf forest in the Checua valley near Bogota, and was based on the idea of vegetation succession accelerated by canopy closure of planted woody species. In order to execute this restoration project, the project first evaluated habitat requirements of desired species, growing site characteristics of the desired vegetation type, and propagule dispersal abilities. The principal research questions that were addressed in the course of the project were: 1) Which types of vegetation was present in the study area, and what pathways of (secondary) succession were likely to occur?; 2) Was seed dispersal a limiting factor for development of secondary scrub and dwarf forest? 3) How do planted pioneer- and late-successional species perform in open secondary vegetation types? 4) Can natural succession in pastures and scrubs be accelerated by plantation of native woody species? 5) How do planted pioneer- and late-successional species perform in exotic Acacia decurrens forest? 6) Do plantations of native species leave prospects for conversion of exotic forests into native vegetation?Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation The high plain of Bogotá is one of the most populated and intensely cultivated regions in the Andes of Colombia. The increase of the human population, and hence of resource demands, have experienced a strong acceleration during the last decades. Bogotá is heavily dependent on the surrounding mountain ranges for its drinking water supply, especially on the northern part, where the Bogotá River originates. This is one of the important water sources for the high plain and the city of Bogotá. Due to poor land use and vegetation cover there is little water retention and almost all water is lost to superficial runoff. This has had a strongly degrading effect on the unprotected soils, and extensive badlands are a common sight. The effects on the high plains water supply are severe as well, as the water flow is not evenly spread over time, but peaks tremendously after a heavy shower after which it drops to unsubstantial levels. The sediment load of the Checua River, frequently reaches 60% of the volume. Plantations with exotics – mostly Acacia decurrens and Pinus radiata – had been established in the 1980s for soil conservation purposes; however, the understory vegetation has hardly developed, and ecosystem function recovery is poor when compared to the native dwarf forest. The picture of poor understory development was confirmed for other sites in the Andes of Colombia where different Pinus species were planted. The study area is a mosaic landscape of grassland, scrubs, planted exotic forest, and fragments of dwarf forest. Disturbances have been common and severe, and exotic grasses have large cover values. Most of the area is covered by pastures and planted Acacia decurrens forests, the steeper and more rocky slopes are covered with Baccharis macrantha – Dodonaea viscosa scrubs in different states of recovery. The dry andean dwarf forest was described as Xylosmo – Condalietum, or “Condalia forest.” The Quaternary history of the dry vegetation in the study area is not known, and hence it is very difficult to define an “original” ecosystem for the area. However, the Condalia dwarf forest zone can be regarded as an enclave in both a climatical and a botanical point of view. One of the characteristic treelets, Condalia thomasiana (Rhamnaceae), is a recently discovered endemic of this particular zone, and relatively many species, both herbaceous and woody, are not found elsewhere on the high plain of Bogotá and the surrounding mountains, and are typical of areas at a lower altitude above sea level. Hence, I believe that many species typical of Condalia dwarf forest have a long history in the study area, and because of that can be regarded “native” or “original” to the area. Combining this with the assumedly high degree of ecological functioning, I think that the Condalia forest deserves the status of “original ecosystem”, and hence serves as the “desired end point” for restoration efforts. The project was critical because the semi-arid valley of the Checua River of the Bogotá River is so important for the water supply of the high plain of Bogotá and because it has few remnants of natural little disturbed vegetation. Many areas have been abandoned due to a declining agricultural productivity caused by drought, the loss of soil fertility and erosion. Moreover, parts of the area have been grown over with Acacia decurrens, which shows a very poor recovery in terms of biodiversity and ecological function. The restoration of the original endemic and nearly extinct Condalia dwarf forest is a goal of the natural resource authority Corporación Autónoma Regional de Cundinamarca (CAR).

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Corporación Autónoma Regional de Cundinamarca (CAR) manages the (renewable) natural resources in the region and is interested in recovering natural forests in the semi-arid parts of the high plain of Bogotá. The succession-based restoration experiment was executed in cooperation with the CAR, in which mixtures of nine woody native species were inserted in different vegetation types. The choice of these species – important in terms of local abundance – and the estimation of their successional affinity, was based on preliminary observations of the local flora.

Description of Project Activities: The project has several parts, the first two were to infer the successional patterns for the nine woody species ultimately used in the project first by evaluating data that concerned vegetation structure, vegetation diversity, soil parameters, and disturbance history. A total of 101 relevees were made between October 1999 and April 2001, following Braun-Blanquet. The relevees aimed at including a maximal variation in vegetation diversity and structure, and at attaining a fair spatial spread. Severely eroded sites, rocky substrates and planted vegetation were avoided. Plot size was 10 x 10 m (85 plots), or 10 x 15 m (16 plots). In each relevee, the cover percentage of all vascular plant species was estimated, and the vegetation structure was described by estimating the average height and cover of low herbs (< 10 cm), high herbs (â‰¥ 10 cm), low shrubs, (< 1.5 m), high shrubs (â‰¥ 1.5 m), and treelets. For each of the restoration species, cover was estimated separately of saplings, low shrubs, high shrubs, and treelets. A bulk sample was taken of the upper five centimeters of mineral soil, consisting of five subsamples (from the four corners and the center) of the relevee.  Each relevee was located on a series of black-and-white, panchromatic aerial photographs of the region taken in 1941, 1958, 1974, and 1991. The time period covered is about 60 years, including the data gathered during the field work in 1999-2001. The scales of the photographs varied from 1:10,000 to 1:20,000. On the photographs, woody canopy cover and height were assessed, presence of erosion and signs of disturbance (e.g., cutting or grazing) in an area of about 30 x 30 m, directly surrounding each of the vegetation relevees. This led to eight units, presented here in order of increasing structural development: 1) grassland; 2) grassland with scattered low shrubs (<5% woody cover); 3) shrub patches on eroded land; 4) low shrubland with (grazed) gaps; 5) low shrubland; 6) high shrubland with (grazed) gaps; 7) high shrubland; 8) dwarf forest. We attempted to express the trend in unit transitions of each relevee site by creating the nominal dummy variables development (increased woody cover and height), degradation (decreased woody cover and height), instability (both development and degradation took place), and stability (no changes). 

The second part of the assessment was to evaluate the potential role of soil seed banks in contributing to the regeneration of early and late secondary woody vegetation in dry Andean forests. Because of the heavy fragmentation and reduction of the dwarf forest area, and hence scarcity of seed sources, it was that expected woody plant taxa would be poorly represented in secondary vegetation. The following questions were addressed: To what degree are early and late secondary woody species represented in the seed bank of young secondary vegetation types? Is the richness of woody taxa in the seed bank at a given site related to the composition of the surrounding or locally standing vegetation? To answer these questions, the soil seed bank was sampled in abandoned pastures, secondary scrubs, dwarf forests and Acacia forests, and compared these with the local woody standing vegetation. In November 2001, in each of the five vegetation types four plots of 30 x 30 m were laid out widely distributed over the area. The sides of the plots were situated parallel to the contour lines. In each plot five random points were chosen under the restriction that all points were at least 4 m apart from each other. Around each point, three soil samples of 9 x 9 cm were taken at 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depth, and pooled for each depth. The litter layer (if present) was included in the upper soil sample. The plot altitude ranged between 2635 and 2912 m above sea level. A vegetation plot of 70 x 70 m was laid out over each seed bank plot, in such a way that the center of vegetation and seed bank plots coincided and their sides were parallel. In the vegetation plot, the aboveground cover of woody plant species was recorded. The cover of scrub (low and high shrub vegetation types combined) and dwarf forest surrounding the seed bank plots was estimated on aerial photographs from 1991 (scale 1:10,000, black & white, panchromatic). For this, circles with 200 and 500 m diameters were projected on each seed bank plot. The vegetation cover was then estimated by applying a grid overlay of square cells, each corresponding to 25 x 25 m in the field. Germination trials were conducted in a ventilated greenhouse, located in a nearby village (Nemocón). The total of 408 trays (20 plots x 5 samples x 2 depths x 2 treatments + 8 control) were placed randomly in the greenhouse, and were watered daily. The seeds were allowed to germinate for a period of 12 weeks (December 2001 - March 2002). During this period the number of vascular plant seedlings in each tray was counted weekly. Most seedlings had emerged after 6 weeks. 

The third part of the project was the actual planting of the nine species of shrubs and trees that were selected for the project. All of these species are native to the Condalia dwarf forest zone and commonly found there in woody pioneer stands and/or in late-successional dwarf forest patches. Dodonaea viscosa was categorized as a mid-successional species, but was included in the pioneer mixture because it is mostly co-dominant with Baccharis macrantha in pioneer scrubs. Similarly, Hesperomeles goudotiana, Myrsine guianensis and Xylosma spiculifera were classified as mid-successional, but were included in the late-successional plantation mixture because of their frequent co-occurrence with the three other species of that mixture in dwarf forest patches. We chose to plant greenhouse-grown seedlings instead of sowing seeds, thus skipping the germination stage in which most plant species are vulnerable. Seeds of all species were collected from the vegetation present at the study site. The plant material for the initial planting was produced in two different nurseries owned by the Corporación Autónoma Regional de Cundinamarca (CAR). Plants received applications of fertilizers and fungicides on a regular basis during the production and maintenance period in the nurseries. At the time of planting in the field, the seedlings were in 707 cubic cm nursery bags. D. coerulea was grown in bags with a volume of 2389 cubic cm. 

Three vegetation types were selected for the project: two types of abandoned pasture, and a scrub type representing the least developed, low-stature woody stage. The plantation was established in May - June 2000. In each of the three vegetation types, five plots of 10 x 15 m were established and planted with seedlings of the pioneer species. Another five plots were planted with seedlings of the six late-successional species. Repeats of both the pioneer series and the late-successional series were carried out with two separate additional treatments. The stone treatment consisted of three or four stones - about 10 cm diameter - placed around each individual plant in the plot, about a week after planting. The stone treatment was not applied in shrublands, because it was thought those plots already had a microclimate affected by shrubs and tussock grasses. Additionally, the series of plots planted with late-successional species was repeated with fertilizer treatment. A quantity of 20 g of ""triple-15"" fertilizer (15% of both N, P, and K, with additional trace elements) was applied superficially in the soil, at some 10 cm distance in the upslope direction of each plant. This was done in July 2000, about a month after planting, when rain was still frequent. All the experimental plots were subsequently put in barbed wire enclosed clusters. Each cluster contained one plot of the different combinations of planted species mixture and additional treatment, and a control plot for the particular vegetation type. The minimum distance between plots within a cluster was 10 m. The clusters of both dry and sub-humid pasture each contained six plots, and those of shrubland four plots. A total of 80 experimental plots were laid out for the experimental setup. Every plantation plot had 189 individuals planted at 1 meter's distance, in a regular triangular pattern. As three different combinations of species were applied in the experimental setup, each had its own basic species density and spatial distribution pattern. The patterns were designed in such a way that the distribution of each species was more or less regular, without severe clustering of a certain species at a certain place in the plots. The first pioneer mix, consisting of Baccharis bogotensis and Dodonea viscosa only, was simply planted in an alternating way, resulting in either 95 B. bogotensis and 94 D. viscosa per plot, or the reverse. The second pioneer mix had 63 individuals of B. bogotensis, D. viscosa, and Dalea coerulea planted in a simple alternating way. This mixture was only applied in dry pastures, because D. coerulea is common around these areas, and does not occur in sub-humid pastures nor in B. macrantha  -  D. viscosa scrubs. The late-successional species mixture consisted of different quantities of each of the six species, due to differences in availability. The seedlings were planted in such a way the species were regularly spread over the plot. A hole of about 20 cm depth was made and the plant was inserted along with all the earth of the nursery bag it was grown in. In November 2000, dead seedlings were replaced by living ones of the same species. Individuals that showed high mortality of leaves or were in otherwise bad condition were also replaced with vigorous ones. 

Survival, length and cover of the planted seedlings were monitored in October-November 2000, October 2001, and August 2004. The stem length of every individual was measured from the ground up to the upper living bud or leaf base. Cover of each planted species, and the total planted canopy cover, was estimated visually as percentage of the plot area. At the same time, the composition and abundance of all non-planted vascular plant species (the matrix vegetation) was recorded in all of the experimenal plots, including the control plots. Vegetation structural data  -  bare ground, herb cover, shrub cover  -  were also recorded. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: While the average survival percentages at the plot-level of Dalea coerulea were below 40%, the other two pioneer species performed better, with over 90% survival for D. viscosa seedlings in pasture plots. Myrsine guianensis performed the worst in terms of survival, the percentage surviving seedlings mostly remaining below 35%. The remaining five late-successional species had survival percentages around 50%.  Survival on plot-level of seedlings of the pioneer species B. macrantha and D. viscosa was higher in at least one of the two pasture types than in shrublands, while no differences were detected for any of the late-successional species. Stone treatment had a significant survival-enhancing effect for D. viscosa, C. thomasiana, and M. guianensis. Fertilizer addition enhanced survival of C. bogotanus, but only in dry pastures and scrubs. Individual growth of planted seedlings was generally poor: the average length of the planted individuals after four years was around or well below 50 cm for all late-successional species. The pioneer species mostly reached a height between 50 and 100 cm, Dalea coerulea often above 120 cm. Average growth rates were around zero or negative for all late-successional species, except for Myrsine guianensis which attained a rate of 0 -  10 cm growth over the four years period. Planted seedlings of X. spiculifera, D. mutisii, and C. bogotanus appeared to have ""shrunk"", i.e., the upper living leaves or buds died. Some species, mainly Xylosma spiculifera and Croton bogotanus, showed reiteration from the base after mortality of the main above-ground stem. Four out of six late-successional species showed a higher growth in shrubland plots (without stones or fertilizer) than in those of at least one of the pasture types, and D. mutisii and X. spiculifera more than in those of both pasture types. On the contrary, the pioneer shrubs B. macrantha and D. viscosa showed the highest growth in dry pastures. The pioneers B. macrantha and D. coerulea showed a higher overall growth rate for stone-treated seedlings than non-treated ones, although this does not hold for B. macrantha in dry pasture plots. This was also the case for the late-successional species D. mutisii, M. guianensis, and X. spiculifera. All late-successional species except H. goudotiana showed enhanced growth as a result of fertilizer addition. Although we could not test for interaction effects between vegetation type and treatment, the benefit of fertilizer appeared greater in shrubland than in pastures for C. thomasiana and C. bogotanus. Total cover of the planted seedlings reached average values between 10 - 20% only in pasture plots planted with pioneer species. The three pioneer species showed an increase up to - on average - at least 5% in the pasture plots, B. macrantha and D. viscosa remaining sparse in shrubland plots. In the dry pasture pioneer-planted plots, total cover values of about 20% were reached in both untreated and stones-treated plots, while in the sub-humid ones total cover was around 15%. The six late-successional species C. thomasiana, C. bogotanus, D. mutisii, H. goudotiana, M. guianensis and X. spiculifera did not increase their cover in any of the plots, nor did the total cover of late-successional planted seedlings. 

In the dry pasture plots, a total of 75 species was found in 2000, and 83 in 2004. In sub-humid pastures, these numbers were 98 and 100 for 2000 and 2004, respectively, and in shrubland plots 137 and 143. There appeared to be no discernable patterns in species increase per plot over time. The number of annual species, on average, slightly decreased in most of plantation series, but again there were no patterns. Average turnover rates varied between 0.20 and 0.30 for dry pasture and shrubland plots, and between 0.30 and 0.40 for sub-humid plots. No differences in turnover rates were found between planted species mixtures or between additional treatments. Moreover, control plots did not have turnover rates different from those of planted plots. Since pasture-plots planted with pioneer species were the only ones yielding a total planted canopy cover between 10  -  20%, which is a substantial change from the initial situation, the analyses of vegetation development is restricted to only these plots and the control plots. Changes in the remaining plots did not appear to be an effect of the plantation. In pasture plots, it was found that there were few herb species normally found in shrublands. Woody species invading pasture plots were mostly pioneers. Dalea coerulea was found in pioneer-planted dry pasture plots, most probably offspring from the planted seedlings. The commonly planted exotic Acacia decurrens invaded five shrubland plots. In dry pasture plots, among the species mostly increasing their cover over time were the grasses Botriochloa saccharoides, Aristida laxa, Sporobolus indicus, and Pennisetum clandestinum. The shrub Baccharis macrantha also increased cover. In sub-humid pastures, the common grass Anthoxanthum odoratum decreased in cover, while Rhynchospora nervosa and Cyperus aggregatus became more abundant. In shrublands, the most common woody species became more abundant (B. macrantha, Dodonaea viscosa), together with the spreading herbs Cuphea serpyllifolia and Rhynchospora nervosa. The grass Aristida laxa declined its cover. Most of the pioneer-planted plots clearly showed an increase in herbaceous cover and a decrease in bare ground. In dry pastures, there was no apparent differences between control and planted plots were regard to herb cover, while the decrease in bare ground was higher in planted plots than in control plots. 

The high overall rates of mortality, mostly for late-successional species, could be explained by night frosts, which have been exceptionally severe during the dry periods of January to March 2001 and January to March 2004. In addition, drought has probably been another major cause of mortality. The positive effect of the stone treatment on survival of nearly all species suggests desiccation stress for naturally germinated seedlings in both dry and sub-humid grasslands. The positive effect of stones on stem growth of several species planted in sub-humid pastures was mostly not found in dry pastures, or less strongly so. It even appeared negative for B. macrantha in dry pastures. Fertilizer addition generally increased growth but not better survival, of the late successional species. The degree of increase in nutrient uptake by seedlings  -  causing enhanced performance  -  resulting from fertilizer addition, depends on local soil physical and chemical characteristics. In shrublands, low growth rates and cover could be explained by competition for water with the abundant bunchgrasses and shrubs. Additionally, the shallow soils of these sites could also explain low overall growth rates. The late-successional species considered here are favoured by a certain minimum level of soil humidity, which could be conserved if (woody) vegetation cover is sufficient. Probably, the cover of the non-planted shrub layer in the shrubland plots was not high enough to have such a facilitating effect, and the observed performance of late-successional species was even less than in pastures. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The only effect measured in planted plots that did not occur in control plots was an increase in herb cover, obviously inversely related to a decrease in bare ground. Hence, instead of a mere effect of grazer exclusion, this is an effect of planted canopy establishment. This might be regarded as the first onset to accelerated succession. Shrub crowns at least facilitated horizontal spread of already present herb species. However, the Baccharis-Dodonaea (-Dalea) canopy has only recently established, and hence microclimatic changes, if any, have not yet had the chance to measurably influence establishment of species. Growth of shrubs and trees was slow, especially of the late-successional ones, indicating establishment of canopy that will take place over a scale of decades, instead of years. Establishment of late-successional species not only depends on a suitable habitat eventually formed by a planted canopy, but also on propagule availability. Seed banks of most late-successional species are very sparse, especially in pastures. Turnover rates were higher in sub-humid pastures than in dry pastures, in spite of less initial bare ground surface and hence less available sites for germination. Species turnover is generally believed to be higher in habitats with high nutrient availablity and soil moisture, although extreme conditions have lower turnover rates. Shrublands were found to have a lower turnover rate as compared to grasslands, which is consistent with results from many other authors. This has been attributed to longer life spans of late-successional invading species, and more competition for resources.  Control plots showed changes in species composition similar to planted ones, irrespective of the planted species mixture or the treatment. This was hardly surprising, since survival and growth of the planted seedlings during the four year period was not enough to establish a woody canopy in many plots. Moreover, even after closure of a woody canopy, processes of colonization still take time. The different direction of change in species composition, as revealed by PCA, should probably be interpreted as little change at all; the picture is focused on small changes. This is supported by the low fraction of explained variance by the principal components: mostly below 10%. The changes that did occur, i.e., increased cover of graminoids, appears to most likely be attributed to exclusion of grazing cattle by the fences.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The methods used in restoration or rehabilitation practices such as this project should be affordable for developing countries. Although the cost of plantations is relatively high, it is due partly because of the nursery procedures. However, since the cost of labor is relatively low in most tropical countries, plantation, even with survival-enhancing application of stones, could be an affordable way for many institutions to rehabilitate endangered sites, at the same time as providing sustainable income for local communities.
The pioneer species used in the project are all useful for plantation experiments in abandoned pastures, given that their survival rates are high and growth is sufficient as to form a significant canopy. Further trials and restoration attempts might include combination of pioneers and late-successional species. During canopy formation of the pioneers, the late-successional species could at least survive, and growth conditions for the latter might improve after some lateral crown growth of B. macrantha and D. viscosa. Especially if the seedlings would be treated with (a combination of) stones and fertilizer, chances of success might be further enhanced. Although growth is very slow, the rates are in tens of centimeters stem length per year, the effects of this type of restoration treatment is clear. Since both growth and propagule availability of the desired species are low, successional changes will probably become evident after a relatively long period. While there was no data to speculate on the length of the time span needed for total regeneration of Condalia dwarf forest, the project illustrated that using plantations could at least overcome a part of the seed dispersal limitation. If collected seeds would be sown out as an alternative for seedling plantation, the loss of individuals would be much higher, and the time span for establishment would be even longer. This would not be desirable, in view of the urgent need for restoration in many sites. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/united-kingdom-england-restoration-of-reedbeds-for-bitterns-at-minsmere-rspb-nature-reserve/	United Kingdom: England: Restoration of Reedbeds for Bitterns at Minsmere RSPB Nature Reserve	United Kingdom	1994-10-01	2000-02-28	"Restoration of reedbeds for bitterns at Minsmere RSPB Nature ReserveFrom estimates of 12 to 14 calling male bitterns at Minsmere between 1971 and 1973, numbers declined to just one calling male, with no evidence of breeding, in 1991. This mirrored a similar national decline with numbers falling from 70 to 80 calling males in the 1950s to a low of just 11 calling males in 1997. Although work had been carried out over the years at Minsmere to maintain open water in pools and ditches, the underlying problem of a gradual drying out of the reedbed had not been addressed. Therefore between 1994/5 and 1999/2000, 48.75 ha of mature reedbed were lowered using machinery to halt succession and re-establish wet reedbed. At the same time, ditches and pools within the reedbed were reprofiled to be more “˜bittern-friendly’ and overall hydrological control of the reedbed was improved. As a result the number of calling male bitterns on the reserve increased to 7 in 2000 – a trend that is continuing with 10 in 2007. Populations of other important reedbed species were either maintained or increased by this work.Other The reedbeds at Minsmere formed during the Second World War when parts of the coastal grazing marshes were deliberately flooded as an anti-invasion measure. Subsequently natural succession resulted in the gradual drying out of much of the area. Although management was carried out to remove invading scrub and to maintain pools and ditches, the underlying issue of accumulating leaf litter was not tackled. As a result, large parts of the reedbed became dry and unsuitable for breeding and feeding bitterns. The number of calling males fell to just one in 1991 and there was no proof of breeding. At the start of the restoration project, the reedbeds at Minsmere covered 157 ha and were approximately 50 years old. Towards the western end of the reedbed there is a broad fringe of mature alder carr. The reedbed consisted of two hydrological units, separated from each other by a bank running approximately diagonally from south-west to north-east. Apart from the Island Mere (7 ha) there was comparatively little open water within the reedbed apart from ditches. Encroaching scrub was limited as the result of removal works in the 1980s and early 1990s. A small scale 7 year rotational cutting programme, approximately 3 ha per year, was initiated in 1991/2. Much of the reedbed was dry with large amounts of accumulated leaf litter. In addition to bittern, the reedbed supported the following nationally important species (5 year mean figures) marsh harrier Circus aeruginosus (8 nesting females), bearded tit Panurus biarmicus (16 pairs), gadwall Anas strepera (14 pairs), pochard Aythya ferina (5 pairs), otter Lutra lutra (1 pair) and water vole Arvicola terrestris (unknown but considered to be low and declining based on casual observations). The objective of the project was to maintain the internationally important suite of reed-dominated communities to increase breeding bittern numbers to 10 calling males (c25-30% of UK population) and 12+ nesting females; increase bearded tit numbers to 50+ pairs (c12% of UK population) and marsh harriers at 8 to 10 nesting females; and to benefit wintering wildfowl, otter, water vole and specialist reedbed Lepidoptera and fen/carr Diptera.Reedbed is a priority habitat for conservation in the UK and there is a national target to create an additional 1,200 ha by 2010. Additionally, there is a national Species Action Plan (SAP) for bittern with 4 key objectives (at the time of the start of the work at Minsmere these were): initially, to maintain a population of at least 20 calling males; increase the population to 50 calling males by 2010; achieve a population of not fewer than 100 calling males by 2020; and increase the number of sites supporting calling males to 22 by 2010. In the light of the success in increasing bittern numbers and distribution, these figures were revised in 2007 to: 110 calling males at 44 sites by 2020 and 190 calling males at 64 sites by 2030. Species and Habitat Action Plans in the UK are developed jointly by the statutory conservation agencies, conservation NGOs and private landowners, as appropriate. For both reedbeds and bitterns, the RSPB is the lead organisation. Therefore this project had the potential to make a significant contribution to achieving the short and medium term objectives of the bittern SAP (and those of other key reedbed species).

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The whole area is owned by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). The Minsmere reedbeds are the third largest in England. The overall planning of the work formed part of the revision of the reserve’s management plan and part of a national emergency recovery programme for bitterns funded by the European Union’s LIFE-Nature programme. Given the site’s status as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Special Protection Area (SPA), Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and Ramsar site, all of the planning was carried out in conjunction with the government’s statutory conservation body, English Nature (now Natural England), the Environment Agency and Local Council.

Description of Project Activities: Over the winters of 1994/1995 to 1999/2000, 48.75 ha of dry reedbed were lowered using excavators to remove up to 30 cm of leaf litter and topsoil to create early successional wet reedbed. The excavated material was used to create low banks within the reedbed to form 8 hydrologically-separate units. During the excavation process, all old ditches and pools were re-instated and reprofiled to be more bittern-friendly, having gently sloping sides extending up to 4 m from the centre of the ditch. This profile allows the development of very wet ditch and pool margins which are used by fish such as rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus, eels Anguilla anguilla and nine-spined sticklebacks Pungitius pungitius which earlier research had shown to be important prey for bitterns. In total 8.1 ha of new open water was created and 10.78 km of ditch reinstated or excavated. Again based on earlier detailed research by the RSPB into the habitat requirements of bitterns, the shape of pools and ditches was such that they provided the maximum amount of reedbed/open water edge. Prior to the excavation of each area, the area was drained and burnt to remove tall standing reed to reduce the amount of material needing to be removed and to make machinery access and working conditions easier. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Reed re-establishment has been good in all of the excavated areas and bitterns, on average, began feeding in the excavated areas within 6 months and nesting within 2 to 4 years. The bittern breeding population at Minsmere increased to 6, possibly 7, calling males and 9 nesting females in 1999. Radio-telemetry studies of Minsmere bitterns proved that young birds reared on the reserve were colonising other reedbeds in eastern England and playing a key role in the national recovery of the species.  Continuing research and population modelling have shown that distance from the core Suffolk coast population of breeding bitterns, particularly Minsmere, is a key factor in determining whether a restored or new reedbed is likely to be colonised by breeding bitterns.Of the other key species, marsh harrier, bearded tit and pochard numbers remained stable, gadwall numbers doubled, otter numbers remained stable, water voles increased markedly (with the reserve becoming one of the top 14 sites for the species in England) and all of the important reedbed Lepidoptera continued to be recorded on a regular basis. The water vole increase is partly thought to be the result of the provision of additional breeding habitat provided by the new low banks within the reedbed.

There is a clear link between the reedbed lowering work and the increase in bittern numbers and the technique has now become standard practice for reedbed restoration throughout the UK. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: In terms of reedbed recovery after excavation, the main factors that can influence the rate of recovery are: too much physical damage to the reed rhizomes by heavy machinery; frost damage to the rhizomes if they are exposed to very cold weather during the excavation process; and grazing of young reed by coots Fulica atra and geese, especially greylag geese Anser anser. Luckily during the work at Minsmere none of these was a serious problem, though one area did suffer some ""˜knock back' by frost and grazing. Wildfowl grazing can be discouraged by keeping the excavated areas damp but not flooded until the young reed is reasonably well grown  -  the absence of surface water both deters wildfowl from using the area and also makes eating the reed shoots harder.In terms of recovery of bittern numbers, this is reliant on there being either a ""˜resident' population that is maintained or the site being within colonisation distance of an occupied site. Encouragingly, radio-telemetry has shown that bitterns disperse over quite large distances. Also, it is important that there is a good supply of fish for bitterns.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The increase in bittern numbers at Minsmere has meant that the chances of visitors to the reserve actually seeing a bittern has increased dramatically and it is very clear from comments received that visitors feel a great deal of excitement and satisfaction at seeing a bittern.
The project has been an outstanding success and bittern numbers have continued to rise at Minsmere, with 10 calling males in 2007. As mentioned earlier, it has been demonstrated that young bitterns reared at Minsmere are a prime source of birds colonising other reedbeds in eastern England. The reedbed lowering technique developed on the reserve has become standard practice for reedbed restoration in the UK and, as long as care is taken with respect to mechanical damage to rhizomes and controlling grazing of young reed by wildfowl, the technique should be applicable for the majority of sites.Longer term, it will be necessary to create new reedbed further inland as all of the existing freshwater habitats on the reserve are susceptible to saline incursion as the result of climate change-induced flooding. Given the evidence that the Suffolk coast bittern population is the key “˜driver’ to the successful recovery of the species nationally, the significance of this risk is highlighted by the fact that in 2007, 9 of the 27 known nests of bittern in the UK (33%) were at Minsmere. Therefore any loss in reedbed or breeding females on the reserve in the short to medium term is likely to have a significant impact. Long term management of the reedbed is a combination of rotational cutting, improved hydrological control and, ultimately, re-excavation of parts of the reedbed. Whilst bitterns were the prime target species for this project, as explained the site is being managed for the full suite of important reedbed species and therefore it is important that the full range of successional stages is maintained. Fortunately, the Minsmere reedbed is of sufficient size that this is possible. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/costa-rica-cano-island-coral-reef-restoration/	Costa Rica: Caño Island Coral Reef Restoration	Costa Rica	1984-01-01	1989-12-31	"This project explored the efficacy of importation and transplantation of coral fragments onto dead reef frameworks. Because of the increasing loss and degredation of coral reef habitats, researchers sought a way to arrest the nearly 100% mortality that was occurring in shallow water habitat off the coast of Costa Rica. The project found that after three years there was 79%-83% survivorship, while fragmentation cause a 41%-115% increase in new coral colonies, indicating that the project indicated that reef management and restoration is a feasible too for the eastern Pacific.Climate Change, Fisheries & Aquaculture, Other The 1982-1983 El Niño warming event cause widespread and catastrophic coral mortality across this part of the Pacific. Since that time there have been several secondary disturbances (a massive dinoflagellate bloom in 1985, continued strong upwellings and El Niño events) which have affected reefs all around Caño Island. Additional concerns have expanded in recent years, among them increasing sedimentation, oil and pesticide pollution, coral extraction for sale to tourists, and now climate change. Reefs in the Eastern Pacific are composed of 18 species of scleractinian and 3 species of hydrozoan corals. Around 4000 years ago the sea level rose to the point that allowed for reef building to occur on the continental shelf, the average accumulation rates of coral reefs in this part of the Pacific are much lower than elsewhere in the ocean, resulting in reefs that are commonly small, isolated, and monospecific thickets of Pocillopora o massive colonies of Porites and Pavona that grow 5-6 m high and 150 wide. Eastern Pacific reefs have to deal with seasonal upwellings of colder water which in many areas is the cause of their restricted range. Along the 1016 km long Pacific coast of Costa Rica 44 reefs or coral communities have been identified, with only two in protected areas, the Cocos and Caño islands. Permanent monitoring of the reef recognized early on in the project that there was an increasing mortality of coral reefs in the area. The mortality of the 1982-1983 El Niño events highlighted the need to evaluated how to support and augment corals through restoration. Futher events such as a dinoflagellate bloom in 1985 that surrounded the entire island and predation by the sea star Acanthaster planci indicated that there was an ongoing problem with recovery of the reefs. Although these were natural causes, the extraction of corals for sale as souvenirs as another stress on the population, going so far as to indicate that Pocillopora eydouxi was exploited nearly local and even regional extinction, leaving only an extremely small population. The slow recovery process and poor reproduction would not allow adequate growth to compensate for intense natural and induced destruction of the reef frameworks.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Coral reefs are the marine equivalent of tropical forests in terms of both diversity and productivity. The reduction of coral reefs due to seasonal fluctuations such as El Niño events, or climate change in general. The restoration of coral reefs then falls under the purview of being a critical component to any conservation effort. The project sought to answer some of the critical questions associated with reefs, including the role that biological reserves can play in preserving biodiversity, knowledge of population structure, and the role of disturbances. The relevance of restoration in this project is not understated as there is a continual, marked decline in reefs throughout the area, and their known recovery differs from other areas in the Pacific. The poor reproduction and low density of viable adult populations will not allow for adequate growth to compensate for intense natural or induced destruction of free frameworks, which affect the long-term build up of coral reefs.

Description of Project Activities: Once the study sites were located, one to five fragments (4-7 cm in size) were broken from surviving colonies of pocilloporid coral species found around the island at different depths and transported in 20L buckets with water to the transplanting sites; coral were generally transported less than 5 km. An area of 10 square meters was established at each locality and coral fragments were placed on the reef frame by attaching them with wire to 30-cm-long steel stakes (8mm in diameter). A total of 58 and 52 fragments were transplanted at Richmond and Platanillo reefs, respectively.  New areas at Platanillo were created during 1988-1989, with almost 40 square meters and 200 fragments transplanted, but only the original 52 fragments were considered in the analysis of the project.  Pocilloporid corals were only transplanted on top of old pocilloporid frameworks. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The transplanting method used in the Caño Island was successful in both habitats. After three years of monitoring the transplanted Pocillopora spp. fragments, data indicated mortalities of only 21% and 17% on Richmond and Platanillo reefs, respectively. Furthermore, the numbers of additional colonies created by fragmenting from the parent colonies were 24 and 60, respectively.  This is an increase in new colonies of 41% for Richmond and 115% for Platanillo over the original numbers of transplanted colonies. The increase started the first year and occurred because the transplanted fragments attached themselves rapidly to the reef framework (in less than 5 months). There was further data to indicate a high capacity to regenerate tissue and grow.  After attaching, each fragment develops into a colony with several branches, and may then fragment and form new colonies.  These new fragments disperse by current, waves, or tides until they are fixed to a crevice or hole in the framework.  Some colonies measured up to 21 cm in diameter after three years, and the area presently covered with Pocillopora clusters at Platanillo is close to 30 square meters, more than twice the original area.  However, the project indicated that generalizations for reef management should be made cautiously.  Results that were seen in other regions may not be applicable since both physical and biological conditions vary greatly among localities. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The physical scale of restoring coral reefs along a more than 1000 km long coast line is seen as a prohibitive concern.  Although the project was shown to be technically feasible and successful it was unable to address those challenges that are more global in scope, such as global warming and acidification of the oceans.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: In the case of Caño Island, the development of it as a Biological Preserve was done so without having prior knowledge of the population structure of the reefs and associated organisms. However, through the project's permanent monitoring and assessments of the magnitude, intensity, range, and frequency of disturbances provided a foundational set of data to answer basic questions on the role of biological reserves in preserving biodiversity in this region.  The Caño Island Biological Reserve is a true reserve of genetic material and coral diversity.
Because it is part of a permanent biological reserve, Caño Island allows for the development of a more permanent process of exporting populations to restock reefs in other exploited areas, once the reefs are restored. The importation of clones of surviving individuals as can be found can enhance the restoration by introducing rare coral species before another disturbance arrives, and before people can remove the last individual from nearby reefs.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/mexico-adaptive-restoration-of-arenales-paricutin-volcano-michoacan/	Mexico: Adaptive Restoration of Arenales, Paricutin Volcano, Michoacan	Mexico	2001-01-01	2006-01-01	"Beginning in 1943, the Paricutin volcano emerged from a corn field and proceeded to erupt for 9 years, eventually forcing the relocation of the village of San Juan Parangaricutiro. This project was an effort to explore the restoration of areas called arenales, or sand pits, that resulted from the eruption covering old agricultural fields with tephra, or volcanic ash. The project explored the restoration of the smooth-barked Mexican pine (Pinus pseudostrobus) to these arenales and how mulching restoration plantings might positively affect results. The project also evaluated the efficacy of including a species of lupine (Lupinus elegans) and how that might affect nitrogen fixing and the development of soil. The project had mixed results and was followed up immediately with another experiment to evaluate methods of shaping the land to promote the survival of planted species. The project ultimately resulted in the unexpected outcome of promoting another native species of shrub that was undesirable within the matrix of sustainable forestry production that sustains the community.Agriculture & Livestock, Other When Paricutin erupted it drastically altered the lands of the area, especially the corn field in which it appeared. The eruptions resulted in areas that were under cultivation or barren at the time being covered entirely by tephra deposits. In those areas with canopy cover the tephra mixed with leaf litter and seeds, while the canopy offered sufficient shadow to allow for both plant germination and survival. In the arenales the tephra deposits were as shallow as 2 cm to as deep as 2 m and their black color because of their basaltic origin contributed to surface and subsurface temperatures as high as 70 degrees centigrade during the peak of the dry season. Combined with the low nutrient levels in the tephra the depth to fertile soil is an excluding factor for plant establishment. The communal lands of Communidad Indigena de Nuevo San Juan Parangaricutiro have a complex disturbance history. Prior to the eruption of the Paracutin volcano in 1943, the lands affected most by the arenales today were subsistence maize fields. Research conducted in the area in the intervening years has shown that those areas which had non-agricultural plant cover prior to the eruptions were the most responsive after the eruptions to natural regeneration. The community’s dependence on timber production and subsistence agriculture necessitated that an effort be made to restore the arenales, which were totally unproductive. Given the reliance on timber the project was instigated to evaluate the potential for restoring those economically important timber species.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The communal lands of the Communidad Indigena de Nuevo San Juan Parangaricutiro (CINSJP) include 11,694.5 hectares that are managed for sustainable timber production, multiple forest uses, and subsistence agriculture. Scientists have been involved in the formulation of natural resource management policies in the communities since the late 1990s, when an extensive project evaluated the entirety of the community’s land with an eye toward biodiversity conservation within the context of sustainable timber production. The present project was an effort to restore those specific arenales still unproductive.

Description of Project Activities: The approximately 12-ha experimental site is elongate, following an east - west direction, with a 2 - 3% north-facing slope. At the time of the eruption, it was an agricultural ï¬eld, according to a local farmer. The experiment consisted of six blocks (A - F). Blocks A, B, and C were protected by one fence, and blocks D, E, and F were within another fence, to exclude cattle. It was not possible to include all the six blocks in one fence because several heavily used trails cross the area. Each block consisted of 32 plots of 1.96 m2, for a total of 192 plots on the entire experimental site. Project managers designed a two-factor experiment (presence or absence of L. elegans and presence or absence of pine-bark mulch). They then planted P. pseudostrobus on the plots for a total of four treatments: control (two pine plants per plot), presence of L. elegans (two 
pine plants surrounded by four lupine plants), presence of pine-bark mulching (a 4-cm-deep layer covering the plot around two pine plants), and presence of L. elegans and pine bark (two pine plants surrounded by lupines and the plot covered by bark). Personnel from the Technical Forestry Ofï¬ce of the CINSJP planted two 8-month-old plants of P. pseudostrobus in each of the 192 plots (32 for each block) during the second week of July 2002. Once the plantation was ï¬nished, four 2-month-old L. elegans plants were planted in plots chosen for the presence of lupines and bark laid on the corresponding quadrats, for a total of 48 replicates per treatment. Pine plants were evaluated on three occasions: (1) in August 2002 for initial height; (2) after the ï¬rst growing season (June 2003) for survival and growth; and (3) after the growing season (June 2004) for survival and growth on blocks A, B, and C. Blocks D, E, and F were not evaluated in June 2004, except to record 100% mortality of pines due to heavy run-off. Lupinus elegans plants were evaluated for survival and growth monthly, for a total of nine times after setting up the experiment. In each visit, survival, height, type of damage (herbivory, frost damage), and ï¬‚owering were recorded. The last monthly visit was in April 2003, when there were no surviving individuals. Finally, they visually estimated the percentage of mulch that remained on the plots at the end of the 2002 wet season. Air and tephra temperatures (4 cm below the surface) were recorded hourly with data loggers (Hobo H01-001-01; Onset Computer Corporation, Pocasset, MA, U.S.A.). to further explore how the time of survival of lupines differed between presence or absence of pine-bark mulching in both the experiments (the ï¬eld experiment and the follow-up experiment). 

Follow-Up Experiment 
A follow-up experiment determined the effect of contour trenches to reduce run-off and fencing to reduce damage by small rodents on L. elegans survival. Greenhouse-propagated L. elegans plants were planted in four blocks, each with 100 plants. Two blocks were protected from small rodents by fencing with chicken wire. Eight monthly visits allowed registering survival by month and height of surviving plants at the end of the experiment; also, the time of ï¬‚owering and seeding was recorded. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Harsh environmental conditions in tephra deposits limit native plant establishment in our field site and other tephra-covered areas. The main limiting factor for pine survival appears to be high substrate temperature. In this project, experiment mortality occurred almost exclusively when substrate temperature approached 60Â°C during the dry season. Pine bark used as mulch was effective in increasing pine survival. After one growing season, survival rates of pine plantings protected by mulch were 46.5% vs. 21.8% without mulch. Survival with pine-bark mulch was comparable to the national average of 50% for Mexico after 1 year of planting under less stressful conditions, such as abandoned agricultural ï¬elds. Furthermore, mulch provided better growing conditions for pine plants, as shown by comparing heights after two growing seasons. Nevertheless, in the ï¬eld experiment, the effectiveness of pine-bark mulch was limited by run-off, which removed large patches of the protective mulch. The follow-up experiment, protected from run-off with contour trenches, suffered less mulch removal. Thus, contour trenches can be useful in unconsolidated substrates such as tephra of basaltic origin if maintenance is provided. Lupinus elegans plants grew poorly due to damage by small rodents during the early-growth stages, by run-off that ï¬‚attened plantings, and frost damage at the end of the growing season. Herbivory has been shown to be a limiting factor for plant survival under restoration conditions in many sites, with overall damage of 64% for tropical forest restoration in Costa Rica and of 78% in seedlings of Quercus rugosa in restoration sites near Mexico City. In the ï¬eld site, herbivore damage decreased with increased size of L. elegans, as has been found for oak seedlings and Senecio praecox saplings under restoration conditions. The follow-up experiment showed that fencing can eliminate damage by small herbivores. Frost damage occurred because of the exposed nature of the site; as canopy cover increases, frost damage might be reduced. In the field site, L. elegans behaved as an annual species, setting seed at the end of the growing season and then dying, despite being a short-lived perennial. This behavior was probably a response to the site's harsh conditions. Others have also reported slower growth of native shrub species on tephra deposits compared with preeruption soils. Because of their small size and short survival times, we did not detect an effect of lupines on pine plantings. The role played by lupine species in the establishment of native vegetation on tephra deposits is controversial. Plantings introduced to bare tephra experience low soil moisture and high temperatures until the beginning of the wet season when plants would normally establish. Our results demonstrate that mulching can overcome some of the limitations to establishment that are imposed by tephra deposits. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The project was considered to bean an adaptive restoration of agricultural fields covered by volcanic ash because it illustrated how a complex series of events can cause unexpected outcomes and present further challenges for the restorationist. At the site, dry years have been followed by several mild years, and plant survival in the restoration effort varies accordingly. Plant mortality can be particularly high during dry years; the intensity of high temperatures during the dry seasons that have followed restoration plantings is unpredictable. Other limitations to plant establishment include herbivores and run-off damage to small plants and seedlings. In these experimental restorations, smooth-barked Mexican pine plants protected with mulch had 80% survival rates during mild years and 46% survival rates during the hottest year""”16% higher than the average for reforestations with this species in Michoacán. Age at planting is also an important variable that can increase pine survival. In these restorations, 18-month-old plants had significantly higher rates of survival than younger plants. Low pine survival on restoration sites represents substantial economic losses for the community and can also create conditions that worsen the restoration scenario. Then there is the problem of Hierba de golpe (Eupatorium glabratum), which is a fast-growing native species than can reach more than 1 m in height after the first year. Hierba de golpe is present in disturbed areas below the tree canopy and other open areas. This species is dominant in the arenales together with false arnica (Senecio stoechadiformis) and willow ragwort or pescadito (Barkleyanthus salicifolius). The spatial pattern of existing hierba de golpe plants is striking because shrubs of this species grew interspaced 2 m apart in a regular grid pattern. Monthly visits by the project team since 2002 provided the evidence needed to explain the existence of these hierba de golpe ""plantations."" Hot years causing high pine mortality also trigger massive flowering and seeding of hierba de golpe plants. The pine plants that died as a result of the hot dry year made favorable sites for hierba de golpe seed accumulation and seedling growth because of the litter and fertile nursery substrate left by the dead plants. Under such favorable conditions hierba de golpe seeds can germinate and grow in areas where the volcanic ash layer would otherwise prevent establishment. Although flowering in this species typically occurs during the peak of the dry season, from late March to May, it is common for many of the plants in a population not to set flower every year. When conditions are favorable, however, massive blooming occurs and large quantities of wind dispersed seeds are produced. When mass flowering happens, large areas get covered with seeds that accumulate in 
small sites protected from the wind, such as stems, rocks or the dead pine trees planted for restoration. Hierba de golpe seeds sometimes accumulate to up to half a centimeter thick. These seeds can germinate immediately when the first rains moisten the soil, usually during June. Other efforts to reclaim arenales have been affected by hierba de golpe invasions. Peach orchards have almost failed completely because although many peach trees germinated, many hierba de golpe plants became established in the sheltered pit dug for each peach plant and out competed the peach trees. Hierba de golpe is undesirable because few natives establish under this species' canopy, particularly tree species. Where native species have a chance to establish themselves, hierba de golpe normally does not exceed 30% of any patch canopy cover. The other shrubs common in the arenales, false arnica and willow ragwort, do not prevent native species establishment under their canopies. Once established, hierba de golpe is hard to eliminate and requires extraction along with the top layer of volcanic ash using heavy machinery. This strategy, although expensive, is efficient. Experimental restoration plots show high survival and growth rates for the native pine species that dominate the forests in the region (smooth-barked Mexican and Montezuma pines), and native shrubs and forbs have colonized the area by themselves.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Mexico is known to have 10% of the biodiversity of the world on lands that are communally owned and managed. The importance then of integrating biodiversity conservation with sustainable uses of the land cannot be understated.  This project sought to provide methods of restoration for a community that relies heavily on timber production for its annual income.  The results showed the efficacy of mulching on the survival of transplanted trees, a technique that has potentially wide application as the mulch is a byproduct of the timber milling operations of the community.  This deepens the linkage between sustainable forest management and restoration.
The community has become a model of ecologically responsible development. The larger project to educate and equip the community with the necessary tools, such as GIS, ecological science workshops, and biological inventories of their work, has resulted in a community highly attuned to their role as conservators of biological diversity. The community has established a group that is responsible for land management decision-making and in the process they have integrated the tools provided by GIS and a deeper scientific foundation of their work.

Today, these grasslands occupy less than 5% of their previous range.  This restoration project evaluated the role of arbuscular mycorrhizae in the establishment and survival of sacaton at the Nature Conservancy’s Patagonia/Sonoita Creek preserve near Patagonia, Arizona. The project evaluated the efficacy of using different sized transplants grown under greenhouse conditions and how mycorrhizae affected their subsequent survival in abandoned agricultural fields.Agriculture & Livestock The riparian floodplains in the southwestern United States were ideal locations for agriculture because of the access to water, the presence of deep alluvial soils, and the periodic flooding that brought fertile sediment into the floodplain.  The aridity of the region promoted the development and use of these areas for both cultivation and pasturage.  The demographic shift of these historic agricultural areas toward becoming more urbanized has resulted in the abandonment of many of the fields because of the increasing pressure on groundwater supplies. These ecosystems were locally wiped out by agricultural development and the cultivation of the floodplains. Big sacaton (Sporobolus wrightii) is a large warm season perennial bunchgrass. Stands of this grassland alliance occur in swales and various lowland sites, particularly in floodplains. Elevation ranges from 1220-1600 m. Slopes are typically flat to gentle with any aspect. Climate is semi-arid with most of the precipitation falling during the late summer and early fall monsoon period. Precipitation may concentrate in these lowland sites from upland runoff during the typically high intensity convection storms common during the monsoon season. These grasslands have a moderate to dense, tall graminoid layer typically dominated by the tall bunchgrass Sporobolus wrightii, with small amounts of mid grasses. The other characteristic grasses may include Panicum obtusum, Panicum hallii, Digitaria californica (= Trichachne californica), Hilaria mutica, Sporobolus airoides and Bouteloua gracilis.The abandonment of agricultural fields contributes to problems such as run-off and erosion, as well as contributing to regional air quality problems because of the lack of cover.  Agicultural abandonment in the southwest is a problem also because of the exotic composition of these fields, ranging from Russian thistle to bindweed to exotic species of chenopodium.  In the instance of the Patagonia/Sonoita Creek preserve, these abandonded fields were part of the preserve and the Nature Conservancy includes restoration as among its mandates.  The area around Sonoita Creek also has significant levels of Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense), the potential spread of Johnson grass was a concern to preserve managers and it was thought that sacaton restoration would provide another potential tool for land management.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The project occurred on an abandoned agricultural field owned by the Nature Conservancy and was carried out by the Center for Environmental Studes at Arizona State University.  Some of the research monies came from the Arizona Water Protection Fund which has specific guidelines for what type of projects it will fund, specifically supporting research that benefits water resources directly.

Description of Project Activities: The project started by taking soil samples from the top 30 cm of the plot area at 15 regularly distributed points. Subsamples from each point were bulked and sent to a commercial laboratory (Laboratory Consultants, Ltd., Tempe, Arizona, U.S.A.) for analysis (pH and electrical conductivity in 1:1 water 
paste; nitrate-N by ion selective electrode; extractable phosphorus by Olsen method; organic matter by Walkley-Black method; soil texture by hydrometer). The soil was classified as a loam, with 48.8% sand, 30.6% silt, and 20.6% clay, with a pH of 8.0. Organic matter was 2%, nitrate was 12 ppm, bicarbonate phosphorus was 15 ppm, and exchangeable sodium was 42 ppm. Separate samples were collected and evaluated for mycorrhizal inoculum potential using the mean infection percentage method. Two samples were taken along the center line of the plot area, one-third of the way in from the north and south ends. Zea mays  L. (corn) was grown as a host in a one-fourth dilution of the sample soil, and roots were stained in trypan blue. One hundred 1-cm root segments were examined for colonization using a light microscope. The mean infection percentage values ranged from 31.9% in the south end of the field to 9.7% in the north end. Transplants were made on 22 - 23 July 1998, 2 weeks after the onset of the summer monsoon rains. A blocked design was used for planting, consisting of four blocks of 10 tall pot plants and eight blocks of 21 cone-tainer grown plants. Plants were spaced at 1-m intervals with 2 m between blocks. Six mycorrhizal and six non-mycorrhizal blocks were arranged in alternating treatments. Water was supplemented only when plants showed signs of severe drought stress (leaf rolling and die-back) during the remainder of the growing season. This occurred twice: On 8 September each plant received 1 L of water by hand watering, and on 15 October each plant received 1.8 L. Weeds were managed during the growing season by hand removal within blocks but not in the corridors between blocks. Data were collected 2, 4, and 10 months after transplanting. Height, basal diameter, and number of tillers were recorded for all tall pot plants and a subsample of 80 cone plants (all plants in the interior of each block), and survival was recorded for all plants. Five tall pot plants and three cone plants in each block were designated for collection of root cores. Cores 2 cm in diameter and 12 cm deep were taken 10 cm from the center of the plant. The same plants were cored at each data collection; cores were taken from different sides of the plants each time. Cores were placed in plastic vials and taken back to the laboratory, where roots were removed and stored in 50% ethanol for mycorrhizal examination. At 12.5 months, final data were collected on height, basal diameter, and number of panicles for every plant. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Inoculation with AM fungi during the transplant production stage had a significant effect on plant growth after plants were transplanted into an abandoned agriculture field (Table 2). Tiller production and basal diameter were significantly greater in pre-inoculated plants than in uninoculated plants at all measurement dates. Heights were significantly greater in pre-inoculated plants at the 2-month and 1-year measurements and were significant at p = 0.057 at 10 months. The type of container used during the transplant production stage also had a significant effect on plant growth after plants were transplanted into an abandoned agricultural field. Plants started in cone-tainers had significantly greater heights and tiller production at all measurement dates and greater basal diameters at all but the 1-year measurement. There were no treatment x container interaction effects for height, tillers, or basal diameter at any measurement time. Plant survival was high for all treatments, but the only treatment with 100% survival at final data collection (12.5 months) was pre-inoculated plants started in cone-tainers. Pre-inoculation had a significant effect on mean panicle production. The percent of plants with panicles and the mean number of panicles on those plants that produced panicles also appeared to be greater in pre-inoculated plants, but differences were not significant. Pre-inoculation appeared to have a greater effect on the survival of plants at the edges of blocks in comparison with the center. When survival percentage data were arcsine transformed, there was a significant interaction effect between treatment and position; however, even with transformation the data set was not normal. Interaction effects (treatment x position) were significant for final basal diameter (p= 0.023) and panicle production (p=0.047). Pre-inoculation had a greater effect on basal diameters and panicle production in the center of blocks, whereas plants at the edge were uniformly smaller with lower panicle production. Data from the project showed that pre-inoculated plants showed greater growth and survival rates than uninoculated plants 1 year after they were transplanted into an abandoned agricultural field. The continued benefit of pre-inoculation seen in this project, even after uninoculated plants became colonized, could indicate that the AM fungal assemblage present in the abandoned field transplant site did not confer the same benefits as the assemblage that was collected from an existing grassland and used to inoculate plants in the greenhouse. It is also possible that the sustained differences between pre-inoculated and uninoculated plants are the result of a ""head start"" in pre-inoculated plants. In this case, pre-inoculation enabled plants to recover from transplant shock more quickly than uninoculated counterparts, and the differences in growth that were established during the first 2 months lingered. The head start hypothesis would not, however, explain differences in survival, because most mortality occurred over the winter and early spring. Most surprising among the results of this study was the effect of container type on transplant growth. Monitoring of an earlier sacaton transplant project that had no mycorrhizal treatment showed that plants started in tall pots had out-performed plants started in cone-tainers. In this project plants grown in the smaller cone-tainers consistently out-performed plants grown in tall pots. The differing results between the two transplant projects could be due to differences between the studies during the transplant production stage. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The project showed that restoration of sacaton is possible within its historic range, however it also illustrated that drought can be a limiting factor.  Sacaton requires water in the course of its establishment phase and the necessity of watering the transplants during a particularly dry year illustrated this.
Because the Patagonia/Sonoita Creek preserve is owned by the Nature Conservancy it enjoys particularly clear protections. Preserve staff continue to monitor the project for its success from a land management perspective. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/mexico-los-tuxtlas-tropical-forest-restoration/	Mexico: Los Tuxtlas Tropical Forest Restoration	Mexico	2008-04-14	2008-04-14	"The Los Tuxtlas project was started with the hypothesis that planting seedlings of interior forest species after land abandonment could sharply accelerate the process of re-vegetation of complex communities. Pioneer stands or monocultural plantations may be enriched with seedlings of late-successional animal-dispersed trees, or initial plantings could be mixes of late-successional and pioneer species. This project sets criteria for selecting species for enrichment and in some cases for overstoreys. The underlying idea for the restoration work at Los Tuxtlas Biological Station in the state of Veracruz, Mexico was that in the process of conversion of rainforest to pastoral or agricultural use and then back to rainforest has shown a difficulty in the recovery of equivalent levels of biodiversity found in the original forest. In order to evaluate the restoration of deep-forest species, researchers looked at both natural regeneration and experimental plantings in pasture that had been abandoned. By evaluating the variability in leaf traits, which is required during the development from a seedling to a tree, it was found that it is already measurable in juvenile trees distributed over a range of environments. Variability in leaf traits, and therefore ecological performance, was expected to correlate with tree stature because of the light gradient that occurs from the bottom to the top of the forest. Tall species may experience low light levels as seedlings or juveniles inhabiting the forest ï¬‚oor, but higher light levels as they gain height. Therefore, they show leaves with traits related to high-light environments while short-statured trees show leaves with traits of low-light environments. In addition, tall species experience higher heterogeneity in light levels within their crowns than shorter species that spend most of their lives under lower light levels. For tall tree species, labile leaf characteristics provide the functional means of adjusting easily to the changing environmental conditions of early-successional environments. The project was most interested in whether: (1) the growth and survival of late-successional species growing in pastures, edges and secondary forests is related to intraspeciï¬c variation of SLM (specific leaf mass) and leaf density, (2) growth and survival and leaf traits of late-successional trees are related to the maximum mature height of species, and (3) if those late-successional species that grow faster survive better in early-successional environments. It was found through the course of the project that the planting of late-successional species in early-successional environments helps enrich low-diversity forests colonized by pioneers that arrive by unassisted dispersal. To select late-successional species to enrich early-successional environments, we relate plant traits to ecological performance. Maximum mature height and variation in leaf traits are associated with survival or growth rates of late successional species planted in early-successional environments.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation The area near Los Tuxtlas has been inhabited since pre-Columbian times. Its location in southern Veracruz state places it within a mix of cultures ranging from Olmec to Mayan to Creole. Subsistence agriculture has been practiced continually since the days of the Olmec, but with the arrival of the Spanish came cattle and the necessity of clearing land for pasture. The area around Los Tuxtlas is today a mix of small agricultural fields, pasture, and remnant forest. In 1968, the project site was deforested and subsequently used for agriculture for four years and then as pasture for fifteen years. It has undergone natural regeneration since abandonment in 1987. The preserve near Los Tuxtlas is the northernmost extension of lowland evergreen rainforest in the neotropics. These forests were once dominant in the lowlands along the Gulf of Mexico and stretch south through Central America and into South America. Los Tuxtlas is a part of the Mexican volcanic belt, a mountain range formed in the Oligocene period with the rock foldings and the intense volcanic activity present from its origins. In general the flora of Los Tuxtlas is associated with neotropical floras of the Caribbean Region and specifically, the Province of the Coast of the Gulf of Mexico. An important component of its flora originated in Central and South America and its distribution seems to have played a preponderant role in the processes of speciation of the Mexican flora. Although around 75 % of the species of plants are found in Central America, Los Tuxtlas is one of the five areas with the highest endemism of trees in Mexico and it has been indicated that nearly 10 % of the trees of the superior canopy, endemic to the warm-humid zones of Mexico. Historically, these rainforests are some of the most biologically diverse ecosystems on the planet. Neotropical rainforest is composed of four distinct layers: the emergent layer, the canopy, the understory and the forest floor. Each layer has its own flora and fauna, which in some instances can mean upwards of 10,000 species or more in a single acre. 1. Planting of 45 species of pioneer and late-successional trees, palms and lianas to evaluate their survival and growth rates in abandoned pastures.
2. Identify vegetative traits (e.g. leaf traits, maximal tree height) that predict success in survival and growth of 23 species of trees under the stressful conditions of open pasture or recently abandoned cropland. Also, to use those traits as selection criteria for species to enrich or dominate forest restoration.
3. Planting of 12 late-successional tree species in secondary forest and pastures to evaluate simulated arrested succession and identify those traits that predict survival and growth rates in persistent adverse conditions such as pastures with no input of pioneer species (arrested succession).
4. Evaluate survival and growth rates of late-successional tree species under initial arrested succession and subsequent natural succession.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Large areas of tropical rainforest are being lost annually to deforestation. These lands are being used for a variety of agricultural activities. At the same time, thousands of acres of land are being abandoned annually, allowing for forest succession. The project focused on the consequences of abandonment, including how on top of losing the initial biodiversity of the rainforest there was an additional “˜time tax’ on the delay in colonization of deep forest species. The project focused on how intentional plantings could increase the colonization and hence diversity of those areas undergoing succession. This land belongs now to a forest reserve. The study site is close to a 640 ha reserve of the northernmost rain forest in the Neotropics, which belongs to UNAM (Universidad Nacional Autonomia de Mexico). The researchers were interested in how to integrate low-input methods of forest restoration to enhance levels of biodiversity as succession progressed.

Description of Project Activities: The project is part of a permanent project examining the restoration of neotropical rainforests using intentional planting of late-successional tree species. From 23 late-successional tree species evaluated, those with high intraspecific variability in leaf mass per unit leaf area (specific leaf mass; SLM) showed higher survival and growth rates across different microhabitats of early successional environments than species with low variability in SLM. The predictive power was higher for mid-canopy species (>11-25 m). For twelve late-successional tree species evaluated, those species with low mean SLM measured in sun (pastures) or shade (secondary forest) leaves showed higher growth rates in height when growing in abandoned pastures with long-lasting high light conditions for 17 months. Maximum tree height was related to variation in SLM but it was not correlated to survival and growth rates in early successional ecosystems and neither in pastures. Leaf traits offer easily measurable variables that may provide criteria for selection of species for planting mixed species stands. This alleviates the need to individually screen large numbers of late-successional species for performance in different scenarios of restoration (i.e. early successional ecosystems, pastures).

The general procedure was to germinate seeds collected from the Los Tuxtlas Biological Station (LTBS) in a shaded nursery, and transplant seedlings to three microhabitats in the field. In August - December 1996, seeds of 45 species of pioneer and late-successional trees, palms and lianas were collected from the LTBS and germinated under shade in a nursery (100 individuals per species, on average; total of N = 5000 individuals). Seeds were collected from more than three maternal individuals to ensure genetic diversity. During January - March 1997, researchers marked a grid of 5000 2 m x 2 m squares covering the ï¬eld, including each of the above-designated microhabitats. Seedlings of the 45 species approximately 4 months old were planted in mixed stands, one seedling in the middle of each square. The microhabitat that each experimental individual inhabited was described with respect to crown illumination index in 2001. This index ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 representing the dark understory of the secondary forest (no direct light reaching individuals) and 5 representing sunny pasture (individuals totally exposed to light). To characterize the physical environment in the ï¬ve different levels of crown illumination index, researchers measured photon-ï¬‚ux density (PFD), gravimetric soil moisture, and bulk density in a sub-sample of individuals during the dry season. PFD was measured with a Light Meter (Li-cor LI-189 quantum sensor). Gravimetric soil moisture and bulk density were measured following Chapman (1976),  bulk density was used as an estimate of soil compaction. Individuals of all species were exposed to signiï¬cantly different photon-ï¬‚ux densities (Krus- kall - Wallis(4,495) = 115.41, P < 0.0001) and gravimetric soil moisture (F (4,115) = 4.02, P < 0.005) at the different levels of crown illumination index. Individuals experienced similar bulk densities at all levels of the index (F (4,115) = 0.04, P > 0.5; Table 1). Twenty-four tree species from 15 families were used to represent the variety of fruit types and maximum mature heights of late-successional trees in the area. Maximum mature height was considered to be the tallest published height for adults of a given species at LTBS. To calculate seedling and juvenile growth rates, heights and diameters at the stem base were measured in April 1998, October 1998, April 1999 and April 2001. Grasses and herbs were removed within a radius of 25 cm around individuals at the time of measurement, but neighboring plants above each experimental plant were left untouched. Increments in height (heightt2 - height t1/time) and in basal stem diameter were calculated for the three periods between censuses. The survival percentage for each species was calculated as the number of individuals surviving from 1997 to 2001, divided by the number of individuals present in 1997. Seven species that experienced some losses of seedlings during a small accidental ï¬re in 1998 were omitted from the analysis of survival, leaving 17 species for that analysis. To determine intraspeciï¬c variation in leaf traits, three leaves from one individual per species in each microhabitat were measured for a total of ï¬ve individuals per species (N = 115 individuals). For those species with compound leaves, one leaï¬‚et at the same position was sampled from three leaves. Leaves were sampled from different branches just behind the new leaves to select for similar leaf ages. For those species with few leaves, individuals selected were those with enough leaves to be sampled; when all individuals of a species had many leaves, individuals were chosen at random. Leaves were measured in a leaf area meter (Ci-202, CID, Inc. Camas, WA, USA; leaf size, LS) and weighed to the nearest 0.1 g (fresh weight, FW) within 2 h of collection (Balance Pocket Pro 250-B). Leaves were oven dried to constant mass at 100 8C and weighed to the nearest 0.001 g (Balance Mettler PM 1200; dry weight, DW). With these data, leaf mass per unit area [SLM = (DW/LS)] and leaf density [leaf density = FW/DW] were calculated. Leaf density, as measured in this study, reï¬‚ects the amount of cytoplasm versus hemicellulose and cellulose in plant tissues. Intraspeciï¬c variation for each leaf trait is reported as its coefï¬cient of variation (hereafter CV) = (standard deviation of given leaf trait) x (100)/ (mean of leaf trait across all microhabitats), corrected for sample size. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Planting late-successional species in early-successional environments helps enrich low-diversity forests colonized by pioneers that arrive by unassisted dispersal. To select late-successional species to enrich early-successional environments, researchers were able to relate plant traits to ecological performance. Maximum mature height and variation in leaf traits are associated with survival or growth rates of late successional species planted in early-successional environments. Mid-canopy species with higher intraspeciï¬c variation in SLM show higher growth rates and survival, as expected. Also, taller species show higher growth increments in diameter, but not in height. Finally, those species with higher growth rates experience higher survival. All relationships between measured growth rates are strongest for mid-canopy species (R2 greater than or equal to 0.6 - 0.8), and may only consistently exist with them. Among canopy species, growth rate is the best predictor of survival (R2 > 0.45). It should be noted that survival of canopy and mid-canopy species is generally high and similar (canopy 73.25 plus or minus 19.36%, N = 6; mid-canopy 66.96 plus or minus 23.52%, N = 8). It may be that this sample of six canopy species is insufï¬cient to show clear differences with so little variation in key variables, or that other factors are at play with canopy as compared with mid-canopy species. The successful contribution is an easy-to-measure plant trait that predicts growth and survival of mid-canopy trees; a strong positive relationship exists between variation in SLM and growth and survival of this segment of the forest community. There are good reasons why variation in leaf traits should be a good indicator of growth and survival under varied conditions. Leaf traits vary within a species when individuals grow under different environmental conditions. Plants exposed to high-light conditions have smaller leaves, with higher SLM and leaf density than plants in low-light environments. The ability of species to develop leaves adapted to high-or low-light conditions explains, in part, differential growth rates under different light levels. Within-individual variation in leaf traits has previously been related to success of individuals exposed to heterogeneous environments, for example, in vines, modular plants (ramets of a single genet) and canopy trees. A higher intraspeciï¬c variation in leaf traits may be interpreted as a greater capacity to adjust to current environmental 
conditions of an early-successional environment, thereby predicting higher growth and survival of plants in these heterogeneous habitats. Early-successional environments (pastures and edge conditions) have higher light levels, and lower availability of water, than the understory of the mature forest. Leaf density is expected to increase under water stress to enhance water-holding capacity of leaves. However, in this study even when there is a correlation between CV of leaf density and CV of SLM (Pearson correlation = 0.70, P < 0.001), leaf density is less variable than SLM, this variation is only weakly related to survival, and it is not at all related to growth rates. Similar lack of response to situational shortages of water was found in seedlings of Inga edulis and Ocotea withei growing in pastures in Costa Rica with a dry season as long as the Los Tuxtlas season (ca. 3 months). Perhaps low intraspeciï¬c variation in the trait and low variation in water availability reduce the effectiveness of this character as a predictor of ecological performance. Both studies do show the tolerance of late-successional species to shortages of water, a characteristic that allows successful planting in deforested areas. A gradient in light, temperature and relative 
humidity is found from the forest ï¬‚oor to the upper canopy. Higher light, temperature and relative humidity are found at the top of the canopy, where the highest temperatures remain for longer times and the greatest 
ï¬‚uctuations in relative humidity occur. It follows that the leaves of taller trees are exposed to higher light levels and higher ï¬‚uctuation in environmental conditions than those of short species. Besides the environment, leaf traits are affected by height because the cost of foliar construction as tree size increases due to reduced water ï¬‚ow at the top of the canopy. Reduced water ï¬‚ow results in higher water stress for canopy leaves and limits maximum mature height. Therefore, tall trees show leaves with characteristics related to high-light levels and water stress (i.e., high speciï¬c leaf mass). The interplay of adaptation to high-light and water stress may give canopy trees a different adaptive trajectory than mid-canopy species. The conditions to which plants must respond change with ontogeny. These changes differ for canopy species of tall stature that eventually experience exposed canopy, as compared with mid- 
canopy species that experience full sun only intermittently, and shorter species that may never be exposed to the sun. Canopy and mid-canopy species experience low-light levels early in their lives, but higher light levels as they grow to the canopy. They develop different leaves during ontogeny for this predictable increase in light levels (developmental changes in leaf traits) and concomitant higher water stress as height increases. As adults, these species develop sun leaves at the top of the canopy and shade leaves at the bottom of the same crown. Therefore, higher variability of leaf traits of canopy and mid-canopy species is anticipated and seems to arise in early ontogenetic stages. The ability to develop various types of leaves likely helps these species accommodate suppression and release while growing to reach different levels in the canopy. Mean leaf traits may change during ontogeny, but the trees have the capacity to develop sun or shade leaves as required at any ontogenetic stages. In mid-canopy, species variability in leaf traits may translate accurately in growth rates because they never experience full sun conditions, therefore, leaves within their canopy will always show different traits depending on environmental conditions. Researchers could only speculate about the absence of response in canopy species. The possibility exists that a developmentally programmed response makes them less sensitive to minor changes in environmental light. Performance of canopy species may be ï¬xed since they have a predictable future habitat: sun conditions in the canopy. A positive relationship between growth rate and tree height appears to be general. The relationship holds in more than 50 tree species in Malaysian rainforest, and 44 species in Costa Rica. This has implications for restoration that involves community-wide management of succession. With this project, relationships between tree height and growth rates differed when species are partitioned by their maximum mature height. The strength of the relationship found in this and other studies (up to R2 = 0.46 for mid-canopy species) may not be enough to predict growth rates by tree height only, but it will be a useful tool to start selection of species before further testing is done. Short species, that are expected to show low growth rates in most environments, may be introduced at later times to further enrich the forest. Maximal growth of late-successional species primarily occurs in partial to full vertical illumination, suggesting that the absence of late-successional species in open areas is due to the lack of propagules and/or germination capacity instead of inability to grow in open conditions. Therefore, if planted for management or reforestation, late-successional species are not only able to cope with high-light levels and low water supply, they grow faster in early-successional conditions than under their more normal shaded seedling habitats (e.g., Pouteria sapote and Diospyros digyna). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Currently people and cattle are able to enter the study plantation, as no fence is present. Measures were not taken to erect a fence. As natural succession took place, the vegetation became denser and people and cattle did not cross the area anymore. An open area inside the restored parcel remains covered with the exotic grass Cynodon plectostachyus, which grows up to 1.5 m tall in the wet season. This area experienced one accidental fire in 1998, one year after the plantation was established. Fire is no longer a threat.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Late-successional tropical tree species represent >80% of rain forest tree species in undisturbed habitats, providing much of the structural diversity of the communities as well as food resources for fruit-and seed-eating animals. For places where natural regeneration is possible, but the species that are present in the old growth forest require many years to arrive by themselves (i.e. are dispersal-limited), the planting of late-successional species is a viable means for restoring diversity much more rapidly than natural regeneration. Here researchers show that tree species with high intraspeciï¬c variability in SLM survive and grow better across different microhabitats of early-successional environments, with much the strongest relationships for mid-canopy species. The relationship for canopy species did not hold for this project and remains to be conï¬rmed. Based on the project's results, successful enrichments are likely to include mid-canopy species with high growth rates predicted by high variation of speciï¬c leaf mass (SLM), and canopy species with high growth rates predicted by maximum mature height. Use of variability in leaf traits and other indices (e.g., maximum mature height) that are related to performance may alleviate the need to individually screen large numbers of late-successional species for high growth rates and survival in restoration projects. Use of such easily assessed measures would free time and resources for evaluation of other criteria, such as economic value or dispersal attributes that inï¬‚uence animal populations, for combinations of species that will generate desired restored forests. The range of variation in these traits may differ from one site to another, but in any particular forest mosaic the rankings of variation are likely to be consistent. Some of these traits may be measured in herbarium specimens. Mean values of SLM will be higher than those where leaf area is measured in fresh leaves. However, by measuring a large number of specimens it may be possible to capture the variation of SLM of the species evaluated. Secondary selections of species should be made taking into account those with the highest dispersal limitation (large seeds, low dispersal ability). Enrichment of early-successional environments that includes as many species as possible will maximize diversity and complexity of regenerating forests.
Los Tuxtlas is now a part of a forest reserve that belongs to UNAM (Universidad Nacional Autonomia de Mexico). The site is under a permanent monitoring regime as a consequence. "

Flood control channelization in the 1950s prevented springtime flooding and has stopped natural channel meandering ever since. Resulting higher flow velocity further eroded the river channel, lowering water tables and cutting the river off even more from its floodplain. Geomorphological alterations seriously disrupted riparian ecology, and greatly accelerated the spread of invasive plants. Cottonwood and willow bosque were decreasing while salt cedar and Russian olive were increasing. Salt cedar and Russian olive were recorded in the early 1930s and were spreading from the southern reaches of the Middle Rio Grande Valley. Today tamarisk and Russian olive are the dominant species in many floodplain areas.. They spread dramatically following the disruptions of channelization and flood control of the 1950s, and have largely replaced native plant species in many places. Besides reducing diversity and wildlife habitat, they are more fire-adapted and burn much more readily than native species. Fires became more frequent and more damaging – and every fire further accelerated the spread of the invasive trees. What happened to the Middle Rio Grande was a loss of channel complexity and a loss of channel-floodplain connectivity. The inability of the river to rework the channel on a bi-annual basis supported the development of a monoculture salt cedar and Russian olive riparian system on the floodplain. Both aggradation and degradation in response to reduced sediment loads and decreased peak flows have been documented. Irrigated agriculture has been a persistent aspect of life in the Rio Grande valley since the 1500s. Up until the mid to late 1800s, the braided river had a floodplain that was between one and four miles wide composed of a mosaic of cottonwood/willow forest, locally abundant saltgrass meadows, and occasional marshes. Islands may have been vegetated with grass or trees. Historically, the establishment of new stands was often associated with disturbances caused by episodic floods. There are three dominant vegetation types: cottonwood bosque with a willow understory, grass meadows (alkali or wet), and wetlands. The cottonwood/willow bosque occurred in areas with a shallow water table that fluctuated seasonally but rarely stayed near the surface for extended periods. Areas where groundwater was at or just below the surface accumulated significant quantities of salts on the surface, affecting the composition of the plant community. Saltgrass and other salt-tolerant plants typically would dominate the wet, saline-alkali meadows. Flow-through wetlands, containing cattails, sedges, rushes, and emergent vegetation, likely occurred in sloughs and oxbows. The project had several specific goals: 1) Mimic pre-channelization conditions in the floodplain as much as possible as an interim measure to preserve biotic communities until natural geomorphology can be restored. 2) Remove invasive plants, re-create lost wetlands, provide conditions for native plant recruitment, and maintain diversity in native vegetation. 3) Provide a diverse mosaic of wildlife habitat types. Help re-create aspects of a cultural landscape remembered by older Pueblo residents. 4) Work with government agencies towards restoration of the river and floodplain to pre-channelization conditions where possible, so that natural geomorphological processes can once again provide appropriate abiotic disturbance necessary for sustainable ecosystem function.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Ohkay Owingeh pueblo (formerly known as San Juan Pueblo) straddles the Rio Grande 25 miles north of Santa Fe. The project is entirely on tribal land and involves a multigenerational approach, involving the entire community from school children to elders. Tribal natural resource managers were responsible for implementation with assistance from private consulting firms to
partnerships with the City of Española, Eight Northern Indian Pueblos Council, and Rio Grande Restoration, a non-profit river advocacy organization. Other partners involved in various aspects of the project include EcoSolutions, Four Corners Institute, Conely Sawmill, and the USDI Bureau of Indian Affairs Northern Pueblos Agency.

Description of Project Activities: 1. Remove invasive trees and noxious weeds
Invasive, non-native trees were cut and mulched in place with mechanical brush cutting machinery where there was machine access, the ground was dry enough, and there were few native trees or shrubs to save. Where machine removal was unworkable, trees were cut by hand with chainsaws and cut slash was either burned in winter or mechanically mulched later. Stump and root sprouts (which are very vigorous) were treated with Garlon 4Â® herbicide, carefully applied only to cut sprouts with a hand sprayer. Hand-cut stumps were treated when cut, and sprouts from machine-cut areas were treated when they emerged the next growing season. Follow-up sprout treatments were made twice more, for a total of at least three herbicide applications. Other invasive plants besides trees cause problems too: purple loostrife (Lythrum salicaria) and non-native thistles (Cirsium vulgare and C. arvense) are locally abundant and require control by cutting before seed production and treatment with spot application of herbicide.

2. Re-create lost wetlands
New or enhanced channels and waterways are excavated in bosque areas, primarily in existing former river channels.  Flows in arroyos have been re-routed into shallower, more meandering channels and spread out over wider areas of former floodplain.  Irrigation ditches are maintained and expanded when necessary.  Excavation is done with a combination of a trackhoe or backhoe along with a bulldozer or other appropriate equipment, such as dump trucks, to spread excavated soil, minimize slope angles, and avoid large ""levees"" of excavation spoil at the edge of re-created or enhanced channels and open areas.  Hand crews may be involved in these processes.  Most excavated soil will remain very near its origin, but some occasionally has to be relocated using dump trucks to adjacent areas in the bosque.  Soil erosion control measures have been unnecessary in project areas because they are all located in former (and hopefully future) floodplains where topography is very flat and soil permeability is high.  For these reasons, transport of silt from restoration areas into the rivers is essentially impossible.  Fill material has been placed appropriately in some projects to ensure that flows are diverted into new channels and flash floods do not revert back to the old channels.  All fill placement has been and will be done in accordance with Clean Water Act section 404 permits as required.

3. Plant and encourage native vegetation
Cut poles, when needed, are planted as early as possible (typically in February or March) immediately after excavation is complete so that roots have time to develop before buds sprout.  Extensive pole planting was done in earlier projects, to provide shade and multi-layer vegetation structure as soon as possible, but after 2002 or 2003 we have done little pole planting.  Instead, we have created saturated, bare soil conditions where cottonwood seeds can sprout abundantly, and have developed techniques for transplanting local coyote willow root crowns.  

Willow root crowns are typically excavated using a backhoe to assist technicians, after the willows to be transplanted have been cut off six to ten inches above the ground using chain saws.  The willow roots are loaded into pickup trucks and placed immediately in water for storage, unless they can be transplanted to their new locations within a few hours.  They are kept as moist as  possible during transportation and planting.  Willow root crowns are sometimes planted with the help of mechanical excavation if it is available and can access the transplant site; and sometimes are planted entirely by hand with shovels.  Typical planting density is about one half to one meter between plants when the intent is to create habitat for willow flycatchers, and may be less when coyote willow is included in a restoration plant mix primarily for biodiversity.

Rooted seedlings and herbaceous transplants are planted wherever soil moisture is adequate, which often means beginning as soon as irrigation water is available, usually in April.  Transplanting continues throughout the summer.  Coyote willows, transplanted from within the Ohkay Owingeh bosque, can be planted almost year-round where soil is moist.  Grass seed for drier areas is planted when moisture and soil temperature conditions seem likely to encourage sprouting; sometimes in the spring if adequate precipitation is anticipated, and sometimes in summer when thunderstorms are expected.  Equipment in these instances could include tractors, tractor-mounted augers, backhoes, discs, hand crews and tools, seed broadcasters, and potentially grazing animals.  Chicken wire or hardware cloth may be used to protect desirable vegetation from grazing animals or beavers in appropriate areas.  Fences are repaired or newly constructed where necessary.  

Fuels Reduction/Prescribed Burning
Another aspect to the project is the reduction of fire danger in order to restore ecological functions on 210 acres of riparian forest along the Rio Grande River within the San Juan Pueblo and on contiguous municipal property owned by the city of Española. Russian olive and other invasive species was  removed and native woody species will be planted. The project was an aspect of encouraging collaborative riparian restoration among neighboring communities and working towards a local consensus on what constitutes successful riparian restoration. The project managers also explored the usefulness and marketability of products made from Russian olive, a common riparian invasive species with little or no market value to date.

Pile burning is sometimes used as necessary, when other methods of removing or mulching cut woody debris are unfeasible.  Generally pile burning is done in the winter, when temperatures are low, wind is minimal, and the surrounding soil and plant material is relatively wet.  If possible, pile burning is done when there is snow on the ground or snow is falling.   Prescribed burning in the normal forestry sense of intentionally burning standing trees or plant material is not done.

Irrigation ditches, agricultural fields, and targeted small areas of vegetation may also be maintained with controlled burning.  Hand crews use drip torches and other hand equipment for these procedures.  Fire department support from neighboring jurisdictions, including other Pueblos, and from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, has been called in for safety preparedness on occasion when larger burns are contemplated.  Burning is done under the auspices of Ohkay Owingeh tribal burn permits. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The results of data analysis help determine if changes are needed in restoration methodology.  The monitoring protocol has been changed over the years to better meet restoration objectives and changes can be made in the future if necessary.  There are at least three examples of adaptive management in Ohkay Owingeh bosque restoration so far:  Early in the restoration of the bosque, many cottonwood poles were purchased and planted on the bosque.  Soon, it was observed that thousands of cottonwood seedlings would reliably sprout in areas were open, moist ground was created by excavation activities.  It has also been observed that New Mexico olive respond well, increasing in density with the removal of the exotics, in the absence of a large scale replanting effort.  During the past couple of years, bird monitoring has been added to the regular protocol at several project sites.  Many of these birds can be monitored as indicator species for habitat recovery after bosque restoration.  

Over the years, the addition of certain components to the monitoring of bosque restoration activities at Ohkay Owingeh, give us a richer texture with which to measure restoration success. As restoration activities continue, so do monitoring activities.  This allows us to continue to advance in our understanding of bosque ecology as well as to advance in our restoration techniques.

Ohkay Owingeh restoration projects have achieved some of the best overall control of Russian olive, elm and salt cedar of any projects on the Rio Grande.  Nevertheless, it remains an ongoing struggle.  Even if work during a project is successful in removing Russian olives (and other invasive trees) and the vast majority of seedlings and root sprouts, inevitably a few are missed and seed is washed in by the river or brought in by birds and animals.  It may be unrealistic to completely eradicate invasive trees from the bosque, but we have come quite close in many areas and a relatively small  -  but very important - ongoing effort will keep them from invading all over again. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Without restoring natural flooding and meandering, to the extent possible, to both the Rio Grande and the Rio Chama, all our bosque work so far will ultimately be in vain.  We have gained some time and stopped the  accelerating encroachment of Russian olives and other exotic species into the bosque, but we are treating cancer with band-aids unless we can  allow the rivers to create the physical conditions in their floodplains that enable bosque plants and animals to survive and reproduce without constant human help.  Many small-scale efforts at geomorphological restoration have been completed at Ohkay Owingeh through the (re)creation of wetlands, reconnection of abandoned river channels back to the Rio Grande, and other attempts to add water back to the bosque.  However, large scale restoration of river function is necessary to preserve and perpetuate the bosque as we know it.  Without real geomorphological restoration, which means room for the river to flood and meander within the floodplain, all our bosque restoration efforts will only put off the final collapse of an endangered system.

It will be take collaborative efforts between government agencies such as the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Reclamation, and local and Tribal governments to carry out the large-scale river restoration that is needed.  We should continue to be enthusiastic participants, and in fact we should be leaders, in the Corps of Engineers ""General Investigation"" that is taking place with our neighboring Pueblos to plan river restoration along the Rio Grande.  In the interim, the type of bosque restoration that is taking place at Ohkay Owingeh will provide necessary habitat for riparian plant and animal species and will continue to provide the resources needed by the tribe for cultural purposes.


So far restoration projects specifically designed to create habitat for southwestern willow flycatchers have been nominally completed on 83 acres, with work in progress on a further 106 acres.  These efforts have brought the Pueblo funding of nearly $1 million, and a desire to ensure continued habitat for flycatchers and other birds with similar requirements has been an important factor in getting funding for our other restoration work.  The willows and other vegetation planted in restoration sites has not had time to grow in to sufficient maturity to serve as flycatcher habitat, and will probably need anywhere from 4 to 10 more years to do so.  However, a flycatcher was observed in existing willows within a restoration site for the first time last year, raising hopes that the additional water and/or vegetation added to the restoration site may produce the desired result of additional viable habitat even before the newly planted willows get big enough.

It seems likely that an increasing focus of restoration efforts may center on flycatchers for the next few years, both in creating new habitat for the future and in understanding the ecological succession processes that are needed to ensure continuing habitat over time.  Until and unless the Rio Grande (at least) is restored to a reasonable degree of geomorphological activity  -  flooding  -  continued flycatcher habitat will depend ultimately on periodic human intervention to create the young, vigorous early-successional willow breaks needed by flycatchers and many other birds and animals.  Even if river channel restoration proceeds with all the speed reasonably possible, there will be a continuing need to create additional habitat for the next few years to ensure that there is not a gap in the availability of suitable habitat in the future.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The project has been fortunate so far in securing grant funding for bosque and wetland restoration, and hopefully will continue to be fortunate into the future.  Nevertheless, the Pueblo may well face a need to assume a gradually increasing responsibility for protecting and maintaining the success that has been achieved in the bosque.  One of the key ways in which this could be done would be for the Pueblo itself to employ one or two tribal members to patrol the bosque regularly on foot.  This kind of ranger or bosque manager would be able to spot outbreaks of Russian olive, other invasive trees, or noxious plants or even animals in the bosque.  Such a person could also keep track of problems with acequias, trespassing by people or animals, or other issues in the bosque and on the rivers. 

Any problems discovered that required more manpower than one or two people could provide (such as eradicating an outbreak of Russian olive or purple loosestrife) could be handled by a summer job program like YCC or the Boys and Girls Club to provide extra hands.  

A ""bosque ranger"" or similar person could also perform and/or train summer youth to help with some periodic monitoring of vegetation or bird life in the bosque, which would ensure tribal control over data gathered, give the Pueblo vital information about conditions in the bosque and early warning of potential problems, and be helpful in the ongoing effort to secure funding.  Additional duties might include helping to patrol for fires in the springtime, prevent trash or septage dumping in the river or bosque, preventing unauthorized vehicle access, and outreach to neighbors to explain bosque restoration.  The salary of even one tribal employee engaged in this kind of work full-time would also help provide cost matching that is increasingly important in competing for outside funds.

It could well be that some of the responsibilities described above could be combined with some responsibilities already handled by existing Pueblo programs  -  such as checking gates, managing acequias, patrolling the Tribal Lakes, or monitoring water quality, for instance.  If jobs can be combined in this way, an entire new salary would not be needed to get the work done.
Monitoring, on a regular basis with a systematic approach, provides information that can be used to make decisions and guide future actions. Goals of monitoring include 1) developing criteria to measure success of projects, 2) development of procedures that allow more than one restoration technique to be tested, and 3) development of scientifically robust monitoring procedures.
Ohkay Owingeh has a standardized vegetation monitoring protocol that has been implemented at all the restoration sites within the Pueblo reservation as well as at some unrestored sites. Nine core parameters are monitored on each restoration project at Ohkay Owingeh, unless there is a compelling reason to use different procedures. These parameters yield a standard set of data for fundamental factors that, taken together, give an overall indication of riparian health and function and a measure of restoration success. Fuel loading has been sampled as well for certain projects.
In 2005, monitoring transects for recording avian species were added in two project areas. This effort has now expanded to include more projects areas and more in-depth sampling procedures. Bird species are monitored as a measure of biological integrity in both unrestored and restored areas. By combining vegetation surveys with bird surveys in restored wetlands on the Rio Grande bosque, we hope to better understand the successional processes of restored wetlands and how these processes affect avian bosque species as indicators of ecological health. Sampling and comparing habitats with different periods of recovery since invasive species removal and wetland restoration or re-creation will yield quantitative information on vegetation density, composition, structure, and vigor as these relate to the species living in and using these habitats.
The standardized methodology described in this section is now normally used at all monitoring sites. Transects are 30 meters in length, oriented east-west (Figure 6-1). Global Positioning System (GPS) readings for each transect is recorded from the west rebar of the transect baseline. Two plots, 10 by 10m, laid out to the north of the transect line, are used for measuring woody species composition. To measure herbaceous species composition and cover, 1m2 subplots are sampled on the interior, southern boundary of each larger plot to give four subplot measurements.
Two photopoints are established for each project. One photograph faces west from the end of the 30m transect and the other faces east. A transect identification number is included in each photograph. Each photograph is scanned into a digital file and archived to compact disk, with identification as to project area and transect identification. Photographs are taken from the same GPS location at each monitoring period to record visible changes in vegetation community composition over time.
The results of data analysis help determine if changes are needed in restoration methodology. The monitoring protocol has been changed over the years to better meet restoration objectives and changes can be made in the future if necessary. There are at least three examples of adaptive management in Ohkay Owingeh bosque restoration so far: Early in the restoration of the bosque, many cottonwood poles were purchased and planted on the bosque. Soon, it was observed that thousands of cottonwood seedlings would reliably sprout in areas were open, moist ground was created by excavation activities. It has also been observed that New Mexico olive respond well, increasing in density with the removal of the exotics, in the absence of a large scale replanting effort. During the past couple of years, bird monitoring has been added to the regular protocol at several project sites. Many of these birds can be monitored as indicator species for habitat recovery after bosque restoration.
Over the years, the addition of certain components to the monitoring of bosque restoration activities at Ohkay Owingeh, give us a richer texture with which to measure restoration success. As restoration activities continue, so do monitoring activities. This allows us to continue to advance in our understanding of bosque ecology as well as to advance in our restoration techniques. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/mexico-tropical-montane-cloud-forest-restoration-veracruz/	Mexico: Tropical Montane Cloud Forest Restoration, Veracruz.	Mexico	1998-01-01	2001-01-01	"Tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) is the most diverse type of vegetation in Mexico. While TMCF covers only 1% of the land surface of the country it is home to 10% of the ï¬‚owering plant species. Many tree species of cloud forest provide good quality timber, which is used locally for many purposes. Cloud forests contain around 450 tree species in total (though only one TMCF species, Liquidambar styraciï¬‚ua, has been studied in detailed trials designed to determine its suitability for use in plantations. This restoration project was part of a long-term project to determine strategies for the conservation and restoration of a tract of threatened TMCF surrounding Xalapa, a major
urban center in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. The study evaluated mixed plantations as a tool for cloud forest rehabilitation in deforested areas. The principal hypothesis of the study was that the performance of native tree species used on plantations depends on the speciï¬c patterns of degradation exhibited by each site in the region. The objectives of the project were 1) to determine plant survival and growth in height and diameter of four native tree species used in mixed-experimental plantations at three sites, 2) to predict the future performance of the experimental plantations by comparing them with older plantations started by local stakeholders, and 3) to evaluate the success of different species in sites that differ in their degree of perturbation.Deforestation, Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry, Fragmentation The lower slopes of mountains in this region have been modified for production of coffee, beef, corn, beans, subsistence agriculture, fuel wood, and in and around Xalapa, extensive urbanization. The project was executed on five major sites that each had different ecological histories.  Site 1 was clear-cut in 1990, for timber and charcoal, and then abandoned. Site 2 was deforested around 1980 and converted to pasture. After 10 years of use, the pasture was abandoned. When we started a plantation at this site, a ten-year old ï¬eld was present, although it had been partially cleared with machete once per year. Site 3 was clear-cut in the 1950’s to create a pasture, and more recently has served as a public lawn. Sites 4 and 5 belong to landowners concerned with the preservation and restoration of native forests. They decided to rehabilitate native vegetation in part of their land by planting mainly native trees from nurseries, and transplanting seedlings from adjacent forest fragments. The sites had been in pasture since the 1970’s when the original forests were cut, and both were planted with seedlings at a spacing of 3 m, mostly with native tree species. Site 4 was planted in 1995 with 50,000 tree seedlings in 45 ha and the plantation was left without maintenance. Site 5 was planted in 1991 at the same density as site 4, and periodically weeded, though trees present before and after plantation establishment were allowed to persist. Tropical montane cloud forests are today made up of forest patches occurring in an island-like mosaics on the isolated tops and slopes of the highest mountains of Central America, from southern Mexico into northern Nicaragua. At such altitudes, the tropical climate gives way to a more temperate-like climate with fairly high precipitation. These ecosystems are pine-oak dominated in mountains that are derived from different geological sources and vastly different ages. The more interior mountains of the group are mainly from early Paleozoic sedimentary and metamorphic rock including schists, gneisses, marbles and serpentines. These newly formed volcanoes (six are still active) exist as striking cinder cones and world-class scenic views such as that of Lake Atitlan in Guatemala.  Around Xalapa, you find Cerro Perote and the to the south the tallest mountain in Mexico, Orizaba.  Precipitation on these mountains is typically heavy with 2000 to 4000 mm falling annually and most of them are subjected to heavy cloud cover. The taller mountains experience regular light frosts at night between December and March.
The vegetation of the tropical cloud forests is a spectacular mix of northern and southern elements combined with high endemism, which reaches up to 70 percent in the larger habitat islands. For example, these mountains are essentially the southern limits for genera of conifers such as Abies, Juniperus, Cupressus and Taxus, which tend to grow on the wetter, north-facing slopes near the tops of the higher mountains. These conifers form stands of large tall trees that are interspaced with more classical broadleafed evergreen forests that are dominated by oaks (Quercus). Mixed with these genera of northern origin are genera such as Persia spp. (Lauraceae), which are also associated with southern tropical habitats.The project decided upon three major goals: 1) Determine plant survival and growth in height and diameter of four native tree species used in mixed experimental plantations at three sites; 2) Predict the future performance of the experimental plantations by comparing them with older plantations started by local stakeholders; 3) Evaluate the success of different species in sites that differ in their degree of perturbation. The four native tree species tested in the mixed plantations were Liquidambar styraciï¬‚ua, Carpinus caroliniana, Juglans pyriformis, and  Podocarpus matudae. The tree species were selected because they were abundant in the nearby forest fragments, they have wood properties with market potential, and because previous management observations in a local experimental nursery indicated that they are easily propagated. Additionally, although these tree species grow in the forest interior and are considered characteristic of the cloud forest, Liquidambar, Carpinus and Juglans may also occur in almost pure stands following forest disturbance. Podocarpus has been observed growing in the forest interior only.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Between 1985 and 1990 50,000 hectares of land per year were reforested in Mexico and in 1998-1999 the area increased to 203,000-225,000 hectares per year.  Unfortunately, seedling survival for these ambitious projects was low, 34-43%.  The low success rate was associated with the lack of incentive for landowners to manage and maintain plantations following the planting campaigns. Exotic species accounted for 45% percent of the land covered during the planting programmes, whereas tropical broadleaf species were used on only 22% of the land area.  There has been little research into the use of Mexico’s native tree species for restoration and plantation planting. The 1998 National Forest Census reported 55 commercial plantation projects over 33,473 ha throughout the country. Exotic tree species were used in 14 of these projects, occupying 45% of the planted area. Native tree plantations were dominated by coniferous trees in 33% of the area, whereas tropical broadleaved trees were planted in only 22% of the area. The most commonly planted trees were exotic species such as Eucalyptus spp., Gmelina arborea and Tectona grandis, and in lesser quantities, native tree species such as Cedrela odorata and Swietenia macrophylla. Approximately 2,500 Mexican tree species appear to have potential for use in forestry projects but few of these species have been studied to date. Vazquez-Yanes et al. (1999) selected 233 native tree species as potential native trees for restoration, but Pinus is the only genus which has been examined in long-term trials, providing information to select appropriate species, provenances, and progenies for use in plantations.  In recent years, research and publications on Neotropical broadleaved tree species useful in plantations and rehabilitation efforts has been increasing.

Description of Project Activities: Prior to establishing the experimental plantations, vegetation structure and ï¬‚oristic composition were determined at all study sites. Sampling units had different areas according to the size of the target vegetation. At sites 1, 2 and 3, woody vegetation 2 m tall was identiï¬ed in ten 2 x 2 m randomly located plots. Since site 2 had a tree stratum, the project used ten 2 x 50 m transects to determine basal area and density of the woody vegetation >2 m tall. In sites 4 and 5, the project measured all trees greater than or equal to 2 m tall (planted trees and colonizers) in 20, 5 x 5 m, randomly established plots. Basal diameter of these trees was measured twice, in July 1998 and in March 2000. 
In each plantation and in nearby forest fragment, soil compaction was measured with a penetrometer ten times in ï¬ve random sampling locations. Also, in each site, four soil samples were collected at 0 to 10 cm depth and mixed into a composed sample per site to estimate bulk density, percent of soil humidity, and organic matter content. Tree seedlings were obtained from a pilot study program promoting the use of native species in governmental reforestation programs ( PRONARE or National Reforestation Program) in central Veracruz. Seeds were collected from several regional forest fragments. Germinated seedlings were grown in a nursery in plastic bags with soil collected in situ, and 2000 plants were used in the experimental plantations. Those plants were left in an open space and, before they were moved out of the nursery to the ï¬eld, height and basal diameter were measured in 50 randomly selected individuals per species, and the mean height and diameters (plus or minus one standard error) were used as initial seedling size. The age of the seedlings were 11 mo for Liquidambar, 17 mo for Juglans, 16 mo for Podocarpus, and 23 mo for Carpinus. 

Plantation design and establishment 
The plantations were established in plots of 30 x 36 m at sites 1 and 2, and 15 x 36 m at site 3, with six replicate plots at each site. Within each plot, trees of the four species were randomly planted in three lines of ten plants each at sites 1 and 2, and of ï¬ve plants each at site 3. A total of 180 tree seedlings per species were planted at sites 1 and 2, and 90 trees of each species were planted at site 3. Plants were moved in their bags to the plantations, except at site 1, where bare root transplant was required due to inaccessibility to vehicles. At this site, seedlings were planted immediately following transportation by foot, which lasted less than an hour. Plant spacing was 3 x 3 m. Trees were planted in holes 30 x 30 cm and 35 cm depth. Plantations were not irrigated or fertilized but they were manually weeded every six to eight months. Vegetation at all sites, except for trees, was cleared by machete prior to transplanting. The resulting debris was left in place to protect sites from erosion. At site 1, because of the steep slope, the natural vegetation was left in strips to protect the soil from erosion. Sites 2, 1 and 3 were planted in July, September, and November of 1998, respectively. 

Measurements of seedling performance 
Four months after transplantation, the percentage of seedling survival was measured per species and site. The height (m) and basal diameter (cm) of each species was measured at 4, 11, and 18 mo after transplanting in the experimental sites. The relative growth rate (RGR) in height and basal diameter was estimated for plants growing in the three experimental plantations because RGR incorporates initial plant dimensions. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Vegetation structure and ï¬‚oristic composition 
The ï¬ve experimental sites had different disturbance histories, and consequently they differed in some soil characteristics, vegetation structure and ï¬‚oristic composition. In general, soils were acidic and had relatively high organic matter content. Site 1 had similar soil compaction level to the nearby forest. Sites 1 and 2 had better soil conditions than site 3 which had higher bulk density and soil compaction, and lower organic matter content. The on-farm plantation in sites 4 and 5 also had compacted soils, however, they had a higher percent of organic matter than the experimental plantations. Site 1 was in a state of arrested succession. After 10 years of abandonment, the stratum had not recovered. Pteridium aquilinum var. arachnoideum and Rubus pringlei were the dominant species. However, diversity was relatively high; we recorded 31 native species of herbs and shrubs, as well as seedlings of Alnus jorullensis, Sambucus canadensis and Quercus spp.. Site 2 was very diverse with 47 species, <2 m tall, mostly herbs and shrubs but also juveniles of seven tree species, and 11 woody species. >2 m tall. The tree stratum had a density of 380 individuals /ha. Some individuals (Quercus xalapensis, Q. germana, Carpinus caroliniana and Liquidambar styraciï¬‚ua) were remnant trees of the original forest. Secondary trees such as Lippia myriocephala, Rapanea myricoides and Acacia pennatula were also growing in the old ï¬eld. In contrast, site 3 had only a layer of herbs, consisting mostly of the grasses Paspalum conjugatum, Cynodon dactylon, and Cynodon plectostachyus. The only trees were a few scattered individuals of Acacia pennatula (6 trees / ha). The private plantations showed similar trends. At site 4, at 56 months old, 14 woody plant species were growing, ï¬ve that were planted originally (Fraxinus uhdei (640 trees / ha), Liquidambar styraciï¬‚ua (340 trees / ha), Juglans pyriformis (100 trees / ha), Mimosa scabrella (80 trees / ha, a non-native tree), and Cedrela odorata (40 trees / ha)), and nine colonizers. Some spontaneous colonizers were native species such as Clethra mexicana, Persea sp., Trema micrantha and Rapanea myricoides which increased the density of the plantation to 1500 individuals / ha. The plantation in site 5, at 104 months had 21 woody plant species, 14 species were planted, and seven species were colonizers. The density of woody plants increased to 2580 individuals / ha. Planted trees were Cedrela odorata ( 200 trees / ha), Liquidambar styraciï¬‚ua (180 trees / ha), Persea americana (140 trees / ha), Rhamnus capraefolia (120 trees / ha), Meliosma alba (100 trees / ha), Platanus mexicana (40 trees / ha), Leucaena leucocephala (20 trees / ha), and fruit trees. Individuals of secondary tree species such as Acacia pennatula, Rapanea myricoides and Lippia myriocephala were colonizers, but some individuals were present prior to plantation establishment. 

Plantations of native trees established on deforested lands had differential survival and growth apparently in response to differences in site conditions. The ecology of the selected species also plays a crucial role in the performance of the trees in each site. Liquidambar and Carpinus are light demanding and display the highest growth rates, Juglans is an intermediate in shade tolerance, and Podocarpus is the most shade tolerant and has the slowest growth of the selected species. Land use history and some soil characteristics are important factors to explain superior performance of the plantations in sites 2 and 1. There was a trend indicating that soil compaction in the ï¬elds previously dedicated to cattle pasture was higher than compaction in nearby forest fragments. This trend of increased soil compaction in the pasture compared to forest has been documented in other studies.  The plantation with the highest average survival and growth was site 2. This site represents an old ï¬eld with advanced natural regeneration. The soil is signiï¬cantly more compacted than the soil in the nearby forest; however, the presence of an open tree stratum ameliorates the microclimate, minimizing the effects of full irradiation. The microenvironment of this site may facilitate the establishment of newly planted trees since the presence of remnant trees or the maintenance of scattered shrubs or short trees can enhance growth of planted seedlings. The difference in survival between Liquidambar and the other three species at this site was due to root damage to Liquidambar by pocket gophers (Orthogeomys sp.). Seedlings at site 1 also had good survival and relative growth. The high initial mortality may be related to bare root planting, however, this technique was satisfactory and it was the most practical since the location was remote. This site, which experienced no cattle trampling in the past, exhibited the same level of soil compaction as the contiguous forest fragment, but had a very steep slope that prevented easy plantation establishment. To ensure soil protection and to prevent landslides, strips of Pteridium aquilinum and natural vegetation were left between rows of planted trees; weeding prevented any invasive growth of Pteridium until trees were taller than the fern. Species performance differed on these steep slopes with Carpinus and Liquidambar having higher survival than Podocarpus and Juglans. The former two species grow well in open sites and they have been observed in early successional sites.
However, Podocarpus is a shade tolerant and may require less exposed sites, and Juglans less pronounced slopes, probably because it is a difï¬cult-to-root tree. Site 3, with the highest soil compaction and dominated by grasses, represented the most degraded site with the lowest tree survival and relative growth. In this site, Juglans survived well, but had the poorest performance in height growth because of stem dieback, although all seedlings resprouted in a few weeks. Additionally, seedling survival might have been affected because of late planting (onset of the relatively dry  -  cool season). Also, herbivory on leaves and buds by leaf cutter ants (Atta sp.; dry  -  cool season 1999) and grasshoppers (Melanoplus sp.; dry  -  warm season 1999) occurred twice during the study period, and this may also explain low survival rates. In site 3, grasses did not interfere with the growth of the experimental seedlings. Soil water content was higher in the pasture than in the nearby forests, although they were statistically similar. Similar situations have been reported in other regions. The experimental plantation that included remnant forest trees had the highest survival and growth.  Soil compaction and dominance by grasses were negatively correlated with survival and growth of seedlings.  Carpinus and Liquidambar were suitable on all sites.  Podocarpus grew slowly but performed well on two sites. Juglans had high survival on the most adverse site and therefore shows promise for rehabilitation of severely degraded sites. The three experimental sites also differed in degree of disturbance. Thus, in order to compare them to the older plantations started by landowners we used Liquidambar, which proved to be a good indicator of the performance of the ï¬ve plantations. It had higher height and diameter increments than the mean of all species at each site. The annual increment in height, both for the whole plantations and for Liquidambar increased from the 18 month old experimental plantations to the older sites 4 and 5. These increments were in the range of values reported for an 11-year-old mixed plantation in Heredia, Costa Rica (1.2 m / yr, Chaverri et al. (1997)) and above height increments of 60 cm / yr that Parkash (1999) estimated as increments desirable for young trees used on reforestation programs. The increase in diameter of the three experimental plantations, the older plantations, and of Liquidambar alone were all above the range of increments measured in a nearby mature cloud forest (0.29 cm / yr) and in a managed cloud forest (0.83 cm / yr) in the Claviero Botanical Garden, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Xalapa, Veracruz is the rapidly growing capital of Veracruz state and the area surrounding Xalapa continues to urbanize.  Coffee plantations and other agricultural uses continue to dominate the landscape outside of the city.  While these small islands of remnant cloud forest are partially protected, their expansion through the restoration techniques described and tested through the project remain a problem because of the lack of economic incentive to engage in full scale restoration work on the landscape.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The project illustrated an approach to technically feasible restoration in tropical montane cloud forests that offered incentives to future generations of inhabitants in these areas. Again, while techniques are capable of illustrating a third-way, the potential to reach these ends are limited by the inability of local and regional governments to fund large-scale projects to demonstrate their feasibility as a development strategy.   This project illustrated that there may be just such a third-way toward developing the forests in this region, combining active restoration efforts with the continuing expansion of coffee and agricultural production.
Plantations of native species established on deforested lands had differential survival and growth apparently in response to differences in site conditions.  The ecology of the selected species also plays a crucial role in the performance of the trees at each site.  Land use history and soil characteristics are important in the explanation of superior performance at some sites.  Soil compaction was consistently higher in the pasture than in the forested areas.  Remnant trees appear to ameliorate the microclimate and facilitate seedling establishment.  High initial mortality may be related to bare root rather than potted seedling planting, however the remoteness of the site made bare root seedlings most practical, due to weight considerations.  Seedling survival may also have been affected by late planting, relatively near to the onset of the cool-dry season.  Insect and small mammal herbivory was also a factor in seedling mortality.  The apparent role of grass dominance in reducing seedling survival and growth contrasts with the findings of Aide and Cavelier (1994) in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia, where grasses did not inhibit the germination or growth of seedlings.  In that study grasses had a positive effect on microclimate and the authors concluded that it was not necessary to eliminate grasses in order to restore degraded areas to forest habitat.  Badly degraded sites might require the use of a combination of native and non-native species.   Native tree species deserve special emphasis in the development of restoration programmes as they offer a premium for biodiversity conservation. Carpinus and Liquidambar might be suitable species for reforestation programs in cloud forests and, apparently, endure the bare root planting technique. Podocarpus performed well at site 2, and 76.2% of Juglans plants survived under the stressed conditions of site 3. Juglans could be used in degraded sites, but because badly degraded sites may be unsuitable for just native species, it may be necessary to try other maintenance treatments and incorporate other tree species in the plantations, even using certain exotics. The ï¬ve plantations differed in ï¬‚oristic composition, and land use history intensity; however, they represent the variety of situations that exist in the region. This is obvious but not trivial, we are looking for plantation design strategies incorporating actual cloud forest conditions. Some of the key elements of these strategies should include careful site evaluation, a respect for biotic diversity and local site variation. Species performance relative to nutrient conservation and productivity in order to conserve or replenish plantation soil fertility should also be considered. We learned from the ï¬ve plantations that optimum conditions vary among native tree species, and need to be considered when they are used in a particular site. In addition, insect and small mammal herbivore damage may cause high mortality and therefore need special attention. Plantations of native trees in deforested areas are an important component of the whole conservation strategy of the TMCF in the region of Xalapa. Apart from the conservation of forest fragments, degraded areas also have to be rehabilitated and recovered for wood, non-timber products or to increase biodiversity. The project understood that special emphasis should be placed on the use of native trees as they offer a premium on biodiversity conservation apart from any economic arguments. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/united-kingdom-england-re-creating-heathland-and-acid-grassland-at-minsmere-rspb-nature-reserve/	United Kingdom: England: Re-creating Heathland and Acid Grassland at Minsmere RSPB Nature Reserve	United Kingdom	1990-04-01	2003-12-31	"Re-creating heathland and acid grassland at Minsmere RSPB Nature Reserve, Suffolk. Lowland heathland is one of the most threatened habitats in the UK, with large losses, especially during the 20th century, due to abandonment, urbanisation, infrastructure development, and conversion to agriculture and forestry. Many of the remaining areas are small and fragmented. Therefore maintaining and restoring existing, and creating new, areas of heath is a high priority for many conservation organisations. To assist this process, the RSPB purchased 151 ha of arable land, situated within its Minsmere Nature Reserve, in 1989 with the specific aim of re-creating heathland to encourage re-colonisatuon of the reserve by the nationally rare stone curlew and benefit local populations of other heathland flora and fauna. An additional 34 ha of arable were purchased in 2002. Heathland re-creation involved the development of pioneering methods of soil amelioration to create favourable conditions for the establishment of typical heathland flora. A variety of techniques were trialled on 53 ha and are now being used to restore a much larger area. Stone curlews re-colonised the site in 2003 and now appear to be well established.Agriculture & Livestock Lowland heathland, confined mostly to Western Europe, is a priority for nature conservation because it is a rare and threatened habitat. In England it has declined by over 80% since 1800 due to losses to agriculture, forestry, urbanisation and infrastructure development. Much of what remains is fragmented and in poor condition. The UK holds about 20% of the international total of this habitat. As the heathland habitat declined, so did the populations of associated species, especially birds such as the stone curlew and woodlark.
Loss of heathland to arable farmland not only physically changes the habitat through vegetation removal but also causes changes in the soil chemistry and pH (decreases in pH and increases in soil nutrients) as the result of the addition of fertiliser and lime. The project area was commercially managed arable farmland, cropped under licence by a local farmer, using a rotation of spring barley, winter barley, rye and linseed depending on the stage of rotation of a much larger cropping regime in the area. There was regular use of inorganic fertilisers and herbicides/pesticides and the overall biodiversity value of the area was low.
The project area is surrounded by extensive lowland heathland and acid grassland supporting a high diversity of characteristic flora and fauna including regionally or nationally important populations of several species including woodlark Lullula arborea, nightjar Caprimulgus europeus, Dartford warbler Sylvia undata, natterjack toad Epidalea calamita, ant-lion Euroleon nostras, silver-studded blue butterfly Plebejus argus and red-tipped cudweed Filago lutescens. Stone curlew Burhinus oedicnemus bred until 1969. The objective of the project is the reversion of 186 ha of arable to Sandlings-type heath by re-creating a semi-natural habitat comprising 80% acid grassland and 20% heather/gorse, primarily to encourage re-colonisation by the nationally rare stone curlew and provide breeding and wintering habitat for woodlark. The work described here was the trial stage before large scale habitat re-creation was initiated.
Lowland heath and many of its associated species are recognised as conservation priorities in the UK and it was considered that habitat restoration and subsequent re-colonisation by key species at Minsmere would make a significant contribution to achieving the conservation goals set both by the RSPB and local and national conservation bodies.
It was also envisaged that the pioneering work at Minsmere would provide a template for similar habitat restoration/ creation projects elsewhere.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The whole area is owned by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) having been purchased in 1989 with the intention of re-creating heathland and acid grassland. As the largest re-creation project of its kind in the UK, the project was of interest to a wide range of nature conservation organisations, both locally and nationally. As much of the re-creation work was of a pioneering nature, initial small scale trials were developed and implemented with the University of Liverpool Botanic Gardens (1990 to 1998) and the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (1998 to 2002). The overall planning of the work was by a Steering Committee composed of RSPB staff and academic advisers, with day to day operations carried out by reserve staff based on the reserve’s management plan.

Description of Project Activities: The project area consisted of five fields in the northern part of the larger re-creation area.
1) Nutrient stripping - In an attempt to reduce soil nutrient levels, particularly extractable phosphorus and exchangeable calcium the whole area was cropped under licence between 1990 and 1996, with a combination of rye, barley and linseed. Minimal fertiliser application was allowed. 
2) Soil acidification and vegetation establishment - five techniques were trialled depending on whether a heather dominated or acid grassland dominated vegetation community was desired.
2i) Heather heath (8 ha)  -  this field was ploughed to a depth of 15 cm in April 1996, then topped prior to the addition of elemental sulphur at a rate of 0.65 tonnes/ha in October 1996. It was then sprayed with glyphosphate and MCPA in September 1999 to remove ruderal weeds. A further 3 tonnes/ha of sulphur was applied in November 2000, principally around the margins of the field closest to the public rights of way. Heather and bell heather seed and clippings were spread on the sulphured areas in April 2002 and March 2003.
2ii) Acid grassland 1 (5.1 ha) - this field was ploughed to a depth of 15 cm in April 1996, then topped prior to the addition of elemental sulphur at a rate of 2.58 tonnes/ha in October 1996. It was then sprayed with glyphosphate and MCPA in September 1999 to remove ruderal weeds and with Roundup Bi-active in August 2000 to remove all re-colonising vegetation. An acid grassland mix (83% sheep's-fescue Festuca ovina, 10% common bent Agrostis capillaris and 7% fine-leaved sheep's-fescue Festuca filiformis by weight) was then sown at a rate of 20 kg/ha in September 2000.
2iii) Acid grassland 2 (6.1 ha)  -  this field was sprayed with Gramoxane in April 1996 then ploughed to a depth of 15 cm and pressed with a tractor-drawn roller before the addition of a 2.5 cm deep layer of bracken litter and 3.28 tonnes/ha of sulphur. Five to ten trailer loads of heather clippings and litter were spread over the field in April 1998 and May 1999. 
2iv) Acid grassland 4 (33.5 ha)  -  as these fields appeared to be closer to the surrounding heathland in character, re-creation was attempted using a combination of sheep grazing and natural regeneration. The majority of the area was grazed by Speckled-faced Beulahs year round from January 1999 at an overall annual grazing intensity of 0.09 to 0.10 livestock units/ha. Sheep were excluded from areas with a high infestation of ragwort Senecio jacobaea using temporary electric fencing until the ragwort had been controlled by mowing and/or herbicide treatment. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: All of the techniques applied at the field-scale have resulted in the creation of short, open grassland, despite the moderate levels of residual soil nutrients from agriculture remaining in the soil, and treatments involving the addition of elemental sulphur successfully lowered the pH of the soil to levels suitable for the establishment of acid grassland.

Addition of sulphur and bracken litter reduced the soil pH from 7 at the start of the project to 4.5 in 2000.

Addition of sulphur and re-seeding resulted in the highest cover of acid grassland plants.

Addition of sulphur, bracken litter and heather cuttings was successful in creating a mixture of acid grassland and heathland.

Natural regeneration on sandier soils has resulted in the establishment of the most botanically-rich acid grassland, containing a number of scarce annuals, including clustered clover Trifolium glomeratum, spring vetch Vicia lathyroides and smooth hawk's-beard Hypochaeris glabra. The sandier and more open parts of the reversion area have also been colonised by a number of rare ground beetles, including the Cockney, Polystichus connexus, the first recorded in Suffolk since 1828.

Breeding stone curlews re-colonised the acid grassland in 2003. The re-created acid grassland is also used by as a feeding area by woodlarks, which nest on adjacent areas of heathland. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: None.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Not applicable.
Establishment of heathland and acid grassland and re-colonisation of the site by breeding stone curlews, silver-studded blue butterflies and a range of scarce ground beetles and plants are all indicators of the success of the project. The larger acid grassland re-creation project has contributed 28% of the UK Government’s National Biodiversity Action Plan target for lowland acid grassland creation.
The results clearly demonstrate that it is possible to establish heathland vegetation on ex-arable land by adding sulphur and heather litter. Acidification was undoubtedly necessary to provide suitable conditions for the establishment of heathland. Although the soil pH of non-acidified areas did decline significantly during the ten years following cessation of cropping, from 7.2 to 6.7 in one field and from 6.7 to 6.4 the other, it still remained higher than that suitable for the development of heathland vegetation. The quantities of sulphur required to reduce soil pH to a suitable level (typically pH 3.5 – 4.0) for the re-creation of heathland vary between soil types, and can be difficult to predict.
The rate of heathland establishment in acidified areas is variable, with a range of factors, including soil conditions, grazing levels and conditions during germination and establishment, contributing to this variability. The results show that it may often be necessary to continue adding litter in successive years until heathland plants have established and started setting seed.
Despite the success of the heathland creation at Minsmere, research and experience during this and other projects has demonstrated the considerable effort required to re-create heathland on ex-arable land, because of its usually unsuitable soil conditions and lack of a heathland seed bank. A far easier and more cost-effective option for re-creating this habitat is by removing conifers from afforested heathland, whose soils and seedbank are more similar to those of heathland. The re-creation of acid grassland is a more easily achievable objective on ex-arable land.
The results suggest that natural regeneration is the best method for developing species-rich, acid grassland on suitably nutrient-poor, sandy, ex-arable fields. Natural regeneration on the sandiest field at Minsmere resulted in a flora rich in annuals and scarce Ground Beetles. It was also the cheapest and generally easiest option, although it did require substantial control of Common Ragwort. In the end, concentrations of phosphorus do not appear to have limited the establishment of acid grassland plant species on this field or on either of the two acidified fields. By 2005 concentrations of Olsen extractable phosphorus in the sandiest field were 4.6 mg per litre, while concentrations in the two acidified fields were between 11.5-11.9 mg per litre, compared to 9.0 mg per litre on the adjacent, existing acid grassland. The higher concentrations of plant-available phosphorus in the soil of the acidified fields were probably caused by the process of soil acidification .
Where conditions are less suitable, i.e. on less sandy soils with a higher pH and higher concentrations of nutrients, the results show that addition of sulphur and the seeds and spores of acid grassland plants can be used to establish acid grassland. Even though it is possible to acidify these soils and establish the dominant acid grasses, these (re)-created grasslands are likely to lack the array of drought-prone annuals and invertebrates characteristic of sandy soils. Acidification will also have the potentially negative effect of reducing the biomass of earthworms available to feeding stone curlews. This having been said, re-creation of a relatively species-poor, acid grassland on otherwise unsuitable soils through acidification, is still likely to provide conservation benefits.
Finally, the results show that adding bracken or other suitable litter and cuttings from adjacent acid grasslands is a useful method for introducing seeds and spores of desirable plant species. Providing soil conditions and subsequent management are suitable, it is probably only necessary to introduce a relatively small quantity of litter. This could be applied on its own, or used to introduce additional desirable species to areas otherwise sown with a more species-poor, commercial mix of acid grassland species. Long term management of the whole area is low intensity grazing, principally by sheep but also by rabbits which are present naturally. Rabbit grazing is important in providing suitable conditions for stone curlews and other acid grassland plants and invertebrates. An innovative and very successful technique for increasing rabbit numbers has been to leave piles of brash on the acid grassland, to provide shelter while the rabbits burrow to establish warrens. Small plots throughout the area are also being regularly rotovated, ploughed and sprayed with herbicide to provide disturbed conditions for nesting stone curlews.
Monitoring work consists of:
Development of acid grassland in random quadrats, every 2 years.
Habitat suitability for stone curlews – sward height, rabbit dropping density and amount of bare ground – on a 50 x 50 m grid annually since 2003.
Ground beetle assemblages using random pitfall traps in 1997 and 2004.
Breeding numbers and productivity of key bird species annually. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/mexico-querus-rugosa-restoration-in-ecological-park-of-mexico-city/	Mexico: Querus Rugosa Restoration in Ecological Park of Mexico City	Mexico	1991-10-01	1993-06-01	"In order to define the ‘regeneration niche’ and then promote the restoration of Quercus rugosa into a disturbed area, investigators studied seed predation, germination, seedling survival and growth of Quercus rugosa at three different sites: the forest interior, the forest border and a disturbed site, along a disturbance gradient. Acorn removal on the ground was high at the sites, with higher removal rates from 25-seed clusters than from 5- and 1-seed clusters. More seeds were removed at the forest border than at the other two sites, although in all cases some seeds remained in the soil for periods long enough for them to germinate and produce seedlings. Seed germination and seedling establishment were more successful and similar in the forest interior and the forest border, and much less successful at the disturbed site, due to acorn desiccation.
Seedling survival was strongly affected by site, with the highest survival at the forest border and the lowest survival at the disturbed site after a year. The subsequent dry season, which was particularly harsh, caused a drop in survival both at the forest border and the disturbed site. In the former, a closer analysis revealed that partially shaded microsites enhanced survival, while in the latter overall survival was very low, with approximately 5% of the seedlings surviving, compared to 50% final survival at the other sites. The project discovered a positive correlation between seed size and seedling survival at the forest border. The three size variables measured (seedling height, basal diameter and crown area) did not increase noticeably during the 20-month project at the forest interior, while growth still occurred at the forest border and the disturbed site. However, during the two dry seasons there were large drops in mean seedling height and crown area at the disturbed site, due to more frequent dieback, causing large variation in seedling size. The project results showed that extensive restoration of this species will probably fail under present conditions and that careful selection or duplication of microsites that mimic the partial shade of the forest border is a sound method for improving oak establishment in future restorations.Deforestation, Fragmentation, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry, Other Mexico has a great diversity of Quercus species, (between 130 and 200 many of which occupy areas particularly well suited to human settlement and agriculture. On the lower parts of the hills surrounding the Mexico City basin Quercus forests are disappearing at a high rate and those that remain suffer the impacts of increasing human disturbance. Seasonally dry oak forests are important in Mexico, both regarding extension and biodiversity and their ecological significance for society. The project used an experimental approach to assess the establishment, survival and growth of seedlings of Quercus rugosa at three different sites along an environmental gradient created by two disturbance events: (1) a natural disturbance (i.e. a lava flow which covered an area of 80 square km about 2000 years ago) and (2) a recent temporary human settlement that was in the area in 1987-1988. The disturbance caused by the human settlement included the removal of substrate in order to use the rocks for building huts and walls. An area of ca. 100 ha was left almost devoid of vegetation and an ecological restoration program was started in 1990. The pre-disturbance condition was one of a closed oak forest toward a xeric shrubland with sparse oak trees, including a transition zone or border between them, formed by open oak forest with rich herbaceous and shrub vegetation. The forest understory includes mainly shrubs: Senecio barba-johanis, S. angulifolius, Eupatorium pazcuarense, E. petiolare Herbs: (Salvia mexicana S. microphylla all at low densities) S. elegans, Fuchsia thymifolia. Along the forest border, it is dominated by Q. rugosa, among others: Shrubs: Bouvardia ternifoli,a Eupatorium glabratum, E. pazcuarense, E. petiolare, Sedum oxypetalum, Verbesina virgata. Herbs: Dahlia coccinea, D. merckii, Fuchsia thymifolia, Oxalis lunata, Penstemon roseus, Salvia mexicana, Stevia salicifolia. The xerophytic shrubland, which was formerly characterized by sparse trees of Q. rugosa and the shrubs Senecio praecox, Agave inaequidens and Opuntia tomentosa, was severely disturbed from 1987-1988 by a temporary human settlement. As a result, the dominant trees are now Buddleia chordata, B. pawijlora and Dodonea viscosa. In addition, we find the following species:
Shrubs: Bouvardia ternifolia, Eupatorium glabratum, E. pycnocephalum, E. arsenei, Loeselia mexicana, Sedum oxypetalum, Verbesina virgata. Herbs: Asteraceae: Dahlia coccinea, D. rudis, Tagetes erecta, Piquena trinervia, Poaceae: Muhlenbergia macroura, Bromus exaltatus, Poa annua Forbs: Begonia gracilis, Castilleja tenuiflora, Commelina coelestis, Penstemon roseus. The initial 1987-88 squatters were the motivation for the initial project and with its initiation it was realized that little was actually understood about the dynamics of Quercus rugosa in these environments.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Very little is known about the ecology of these forests. In particular, we need to know the requirements for establishment and growth of the different Quercus species in order to achieve successful reintroduction as part of ecological restoration programs in the disturbed areas that are now under protection. Most studies concerned with Quercus regeneration have been carried out on high-quality mesic sites in the United States and Europe while less attention has been paid to the ecology of seasonally dry oak forests, except for some mediterranean-type areas. The problem is particulary acute in the Valley of Mexico because of the dire poverty that forces many of the squatters into the natural reserves that surround the city. The lack of political will to enforce environmental policy is further exacerbated by the economic realities driving the squatters in the first place.

Description of Project Activities: During October and November 1991 acorns were collected from the study site and tested by floating them in water, which is a reliable means of identifying damaged acorns. Undamaged acorns were used to evaluate seed removal by predators on the ground. 10 replicates of each of three seed densities (groups of 1, 5 and 25 acorns) were placed on the ground at random points along a transect in each site in early March 1992 and the numbers of acorns remaining were recorded daily for the first week and weekly thereafter until late April. In order to study seed germination and seedling establishment 12 cages (25 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm) of 12 mm wire mesh, painted to avoid oxidation, were fixed to the soil at points chosen at random along a transect in each site. In March 1992, 10 acorns were placed inside each cage and covered with the litter present on the surface to mimic natural conditions. The cages were observed monthly and seedling emergence was recorded; they were opened at the end of August and the condition of the remaining seeds and seedlings was checked. The experiment was not truly replicated (i.e. there were replicates studied at one site in each of three habitat types) due to the labour-intensive nature of the study and the characteristics of the area which made it impossible to establish more than one 'forest border' site in the park.  
Seedlings grown in a local nursery from acorns collected in the area were used to study seedling survival and growth at each site. The seeds were previously tested for viability, numbered and assigned to small (< 1.5 g), medium (1.5 -2.5 g), or large (>2.5 g) size categories, as there is evidence that seed size affects seedling performance in this species. The acorns were germinated in trays containing agrolita, a porous inert material that retains moisture. When the seedlings were ca. 10 cm tall the agrolita was carefully rinsed away and the seedlings placed in black plastic bags filled with soil from the upper layer (ca. 15 cm) of the nearby oak forest. Both germination and seedling growth occurred in the nursery, which was covered by a black plastic mesh to provide partial shade. The seedlings in the nursery were watered frequently during the four-month period. In the second week of July 1991 ca. 100 seedlings were transplanted at each site at randomly chosen points along transects with a fixed orientation. Equal proportions of seedlings from each seed size class were planted at each site. Each seedling was tagged, and its initial size and location were recorded. From September 1991 seedling survival and growth (shoot height, basal diameter and crown area) were recorded monthly until September 1992 and every two months thereafter until the end of March 1993. Basal diameter was measured at a fixed, labelled height (ca. 1 cm from the soil), by placing a calliper on the wider axis of the shoot. Crown area was estimated from the mean of two measurements at right angles. Seedling damage was recorded as partial height loss (due to herbivory or top dieback) or total above-ground loss (due to desiccation, herbivory or some other cause, e.g. rotting). Subsequent censuses revealed whether the loss was temporary (i.e. the seedling resprouted) or permanent. Since the forest border is a heterogeneous habitat an attempt was made to classify the immediate habitat of each seedling in order to compare survivorship among them. Each seedling's microsite was classified as: (1) shaded, usually under the crown of established trees or large shrubs, (2) partially shaded by shrubs or close to the edge of the crown of established trees or (3) open. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The differences in canopy cover between sites were associated with differences in other physical characteristics. As expected, deep soils predominated at the closed forest site, while the disturbed site had a mainly rocky substrate, with a low proportion of microsites containing soil and litter. The open oak canopy of the border area had a more heterogeneous (patchy) substrate that can be considered as a transition between the former two sites. Throughout the year, maximum air temperatures were consistently 10 - 13 C higher at disturbed site than at the forest interior. After two months all acorns in the high density clusters had disappeared regardless of the site, while 30 % of the acorns remained in the 5- and l-seed clusters at the forest interior and in the l-seed clusters at the disturbed zone. Regardless of density, all seeds at the forest border had disappeared after two months. In all cases, however, some seeds remained on the ground for 35 days, which is enough time for a seed to germinate. After 35 days, the highest rate of removal was observed for the 25-seed clusters at the forest border, where 2 % of the seeds remained on the ground. Varying proportions, ranging from 10 % to 70%, of the seeds remained in the other cases. There were significant differences among sites for the 5- and 25-seed clusters, with more seeds than expected removed both at the forest border and the forest interior and an equal or lower number of seeds removed at the disturbed site. 
Seed germination and establishment (i.e, seedling rooting and elongation of the first flush of leaves) differed among sites, with significantly lower values in the disturbed zone, but no differences between the forest interior and the forest border. All seeds in completely open microsites had dried out in less than a week and only those under some kind of protective shade were able to germinate. The main causes of germination failure in the forest interior and border were rotting due to fungal attacks and predation of the emerging radicle (possibly by Diptera larvae). 

More than 95 % of the seedlings in the forest border and the disturbed site survived the first rainy season. At the forest interior mortality was slightly higher (12 %), mostly due to rabbits and small rodents that severed the shoots. The first dry season (November 1991- April 1992) had a great impact on survival at the disturbed site, where ca. 60 % of the seedlings died. The most conspicuous decline occurred in February and March, when a period of about 50 days without any appreciable precipitation occurred. Seedlings at the forest border and the forest interior had a higher survival, with only 13 % and 19 % of them dying during this dry season, respectively. During the second growing (rainy) season (May-November 1992) no seedlings died at the disturbed site and mortality was also very low at the forest border. As in the first growing season, more seedlings died at the forest interior during this period, mainly due to herbivory and fungal attacks. At the end of the two growing seasons the disturbed site had the lowest overall seedling survival (35 %), followed by the forest interior (60 %) and the forest border (76.5 %). The second dry season had a great impact on seedling survival, causing a drop from 76 % survival to 52 % at the forest border, similar to the final survival at the forest interior. Only 5 % of the seedlings at the disturbed site were alive after this drought period. In the two proportional risk analyses (one at the end of the second growing season and the other at the beginning of the third growing season), the forest interior was taken as the baseline against which comparisons were made. In both cases the model was highly significant, as judged by the likelihood ratio test. At the end of the second growing season (November 92) there were significant differences among the three sites, with the seedlings at the forest border having a 50 % lower relative risk compared to the forest interior, while at the disturbed site the risk was 80 % higher than at the forest interior. By April 1993, risk at the forest border had increased and was no longer significantly different from the forest interior, while at the disturbed site the difference increased, with a final risk 150 % higher than at the forest interior. The effect of the harsh second dry season (December 1992 -May 1993) is also evident in a comparison of seedling survival in each of the three types of microsite registered within the forest border. At the end of the second growing season (November 1992) there was relatively high survival (> 70 %) irrespective of the microsite, but at the end of March 1993 differences between partially shaded and open microsites had increased greatly (64 % and 25 % survival respectively). The relative importance of the different agents of mortality varied among sites. Overall, desiccation during the dry season was the main cause of seedling death at the disturbed site, while herbivory and rotting were particularly important at the forest interior, the main herbivore being the rabbit Sylvilagus floridanus. At the forest border there was not a single outstanding cause of death until the end of the second growing season, but after the 1993 dry season desiccation increased in importance, accounting for 62 % of the mortality observed. Out of a total of 204 dead shoots, 40 % resprouted. There were no significant differences among the proportions of seedlings resprouting at the disturbed site (32 %), the forest border (41 %) and the forest interior (49 %). The cause of shoot death significantly affected resprouting (P = 0.001), with a higher probability of resprouting after herbivory (59 %) than when a shoot desiccated (23 %) or rotted (29 %). At all three sites, there was a higher probability of resprouting if damage occurred during the rainy season (63 %) than during the dry season (28 %). At the disturbed site it is difficult to separate the effects of timing (i.e. shoot death occurring during the dry or rainy season) from desiccation, which leads to a low resprouting capacity. At the forest interior, where most damage to the seedlings was due to herbivory, this seasonal pattern persisted (64 % vs. 3 1 % resprouting after damage in the rainy and dry seasons, respectively). The period between damage and emergence of a new shoot varied from one to six months, with the majority of resprouting events occurring during the first three months. Late resprouting was more common at the forest interior than at the other two sites. In addition to the cases where all or most of the shoot died, there were frequent cases of partial dieback and partial removal by herbivores. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The Ajusco nature preserve has long been considered the ""lung"" of the Valley of Mexico with its abundant oak forests.  With the pressure of the city's continued urbanization there are more and more impacts on the resources that surround the city, and the presence of squatter communities within the boundaries of the natural preserve itself.  Additionally, the research found that high post-dispersal acorn predation is common and can limit oak regeneration. The rapid disappearance of high-density seed clusters, probably due to increased conspicuousness of clumped seeds, has been previously documented. The higher removal rates at the forest border and forest interior may reflect preferential foraging by small mammals, which are the main predators at the site, and the delayed consumption found at the disturbed site may be attributable to lower mammal densities and/or lower searching activities. These, in turn, could be related to a higher risk from small-mammal predators in the open and to the lack of acorn production at this site since the disturbance in 1988. Most of the removed acorns were eaten, which was determined by the frequent leftover shells. However, some removed acorns may be buried in caches by small mammals or birds and might escape predation if they germinate and become established seedlings before being recovered by a predator.  In our study, this may occur at the forest interior and parts of the forest border, but not at the disturbed site, due to the impossibility of digging in the rocky substrate. A certain proportion of the seeds, most from the low-density clusters, remained in the ground long enough to germinate under adequate conditions. These conditions may be met in years with frequent rains during the period from November to January, simultaneous with or soon after seed shedding. Laboratory tests have shown that under favourable conditions, 85 % of viable Quercus rugosa acorns germinate after five weeks, with a mean of 15 days. It is very unlikely that a significant degree of germination and establishment occurs later than January, given that acorns do not remain viable in the soil for long periods and would also have to escape predation for 4 - 5 months, until the onset of the rainy season in May. If a viable acorn has escaped predation, the germination and establishment probabilities are relatively high at the forest border and the forest interior. The lower values found at the disturbed site are probably related to the high temperatures close to the ground and the relative scarcity of shaded microsites that protect the seeds and seedlings from desiccation. Additionally, the nature of the substrate at this site (basaltic rock) makes radicle penetration possible only in crevices where soil has been deposited. It has been reported at other localities that hard soils and high temperatures prevent oak regeneration and acorns exposed to full, day-long sunlight have little chance of germination.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The difficulty assessing this particular case thirteen years on is the continual pressure on resources in the Valley of Mexico.  Mexico City continues to grow and the squatter communities have continued to grow as the pressures of continued urbanization have been exacerbated.  The need for resources and land will continue for the foreseeable future.
These results have clear implications for the restoration of oaks to the Ajusco region. As safe sites are scarce, planting acorns is not a sound restoration technique. Substrate characteristics will prevent adequate burial of acorns and high-density sowing while acorn desiccation and predation are to be expected. Other restoration techniques, based on seedling and juvenile introduction, may prove more successful and are discussed in detail below. Seedling survival differed strongly by site. The high mortality found at the disturbed site during both dry seasons strongly suggest that low water availability, especially during the period from December to April, is the main factor limiting seedling survival. In the absence of frequent rains, high temperatures near the ground and the porous rocky substrate that does not retain moisture cause extensive seedling death. The low death rates registered during the rainy season at this site in both years reinforce this view, as high temperatures continue until July without causing seedling death with adequate precipitation. Dehydration has also been reported as an important cause of death of Quercus engelmanii and Q. douglasii seedlings in California’s mediterranean climate. The higher survival of seedlings planted in the forest border until the end of the second growing season is probably related to the presence of a semi-open canopy that protects the seedlings from solar radiation and desiccation. Comparison between the two years suggests that, as a whole, this environment can maintain relatively high seedling survival when the drought is not too severe. However, the pervasive drought of 1993 (the growing season was delayed until June, because of unusually low rainfall during May), caused differences in survival associated with the specific microsites occupied by the seedlings. In those conditions persistence is closely associated with the relative position of the seedling under the canopy of established trees or shrubs. Muick (1991) and Callaway (1992; Callaway & Davis 1998) also found that shade and shrubs exert a facilitative effect on Quercus seedlings. This facilitation process is frequent in habitats such as deserts and sand dunes, where seedlings are likely to experience water deficiency. At the forest interior, canopy shade and litter favour the maintenance of soil humidity throughout most of the year and herbivory and rotting, which are common in seedlings growing under closed canopies, increase in importance. Resprouting, which is common in oaks, made an important contribution to seedling survival. The proportion of seedlings resprouting was high, similar to the 35 % reported for Q. engelmanii in California. The lack of a significant association between ability to resprout and site could be influenced by the fact that all seedlings had been grown in the nursery for approximately four months before being planted, and had probably accumulated similar levels of photosynthates. Quercus leucotrichophora seedlings growing beneath a closed canopy are less likely to possess enough carbohydrates to resprout. While biomass removal by herbivores does not imply any harm to the root, shoot desiccation probably entails root desiccation and thus seedling death. This is likely to account for the relationship observed between resprouting and cause of shoot loss. Resprouting capacity and water availability were also correlated, as shown by the differences found between the dry and rainy seasons. A significant correlation between timing of aerial biomass reduction and seedling survival and growth has been described in other tree species. A relationship between seed size and survival was
evident only under the relatively favourable conditions of the forest border. Other studies have shown a significant correlation between seed mass and oak seedling survival in the field and under experimental reduction of biomass, although it is not clear whether it is a general phenomenon in the genus. Our results point to the conclusion that under conditions favourable for seedling survival, differences established early during seedling development increase with time. As with survival, seedling growth was limited by moisture deficiency where open conditions prevailed, as shown by the abrupt declines in seedling size during each dry season at the disturbed site. Although surviving seedlings were able to recover at varying rates, the numbers surviving after two periods of drought were too low to make a contribution to a substantial recovery of the population. At the forest border the decline in size was less pronounced and a lower proportion of seedlings experienced size reductions. The low seedling growth found at the forest interior confirms the view that the shaded conditions of a closed canopy are inappropriate for oak seedling growth.
Significant reductions in the growth of other oak seedlings have been observed when grown in 8- 10% of full sunlight. The behaviour of planted seedlings of Q. rugosa under the forest canopy suggests that it is a relatively shade-intolerant species and the lack of persistence of naturally established seedlings under the forest canopy supports this assertion. Undamaged seedlings showed no differences in height between the forest border and the disturbed site, but the larger crown area of intact seedlings growing at the disturbed site and data on basal diameter (which is related to root biomass) suggest that they probably had larger total dry mass at the end of the second growing season, as has been described for other Quercus seedlings growing in full sunlight. However, overall growth was not severely reduced under the semi-open canopy of the forest border and the significantly higher proportion of seedlings growing and surviving at this site indicate that these conditions promote oak regeneration. It is very likely that the ability to survive in open conditions increases in later stages of the life-cycle, such as saplings and young trees. Neither seed sowing nor high-density seedling input seem to be good techniques for improving regeneration in this case. An alternative and ecologically more sound method should include selection of suitable microsites along the border of the forest or the selection or duplication of environmental conditions that mimic the forest border in disturbed sites. The partial shade provided by trees or shrubs seems to be especially relevant and established trees of Buddleia cordata and other large shrubs could be used; they are also a source of litter that may help to ameliorate fluctuations in soil temperature. Substrate conditions could also be improved by soil addition while planting. Selection of large seeds is advisable if one-year old or younger seedlings are to be used. In view of the importance of resprouting for survival, it is desirable to grow seedlings in relatively large containers and particular care of the seedlings’ roots is required during
transplanting, as starch reserves used for resprouting are stored in the roots. Much of the common practice of reforestation programs in Mexico relies on large-scale production of seedlings which are then transplanted extensively without a proper selection of adequate species, planting sites, or seedling quality. This project points to a different strategy, which might be generalized to seasonally dry and other xeric disturbed sites. This requires a previous knowledge of what a ‘safe site’ represents for the relevant species, which is crucial for the restoration of damaged ecosystems. Other relevant components of the program include better-trained personnel, more effort per plant and a lower overall density of seedlings planted. Under present conditions, such a method would likely yield more success in restoration programs. Like many ecological problems in Mexico, the necessity that hinges on day-to-day survival often trumps the need for understanding long-term ecological sustainability. This case illustrates the often misunderstood nature of ecological problems in Mexico because it was caused and continues to be caused simply by these pressures of economic necessity. Perhaps the lesson to be learned here is that Mexico is ripe for a restoration economy and that through education in restoration techniques and the application of well targeted restoration monies, the country would be put to work restoring their forests and their future.

Namaqualand falls within the Succulent Karoo, one of only two semi-arid ecosystems to be included in the world’s 34 biodiversity hotspots – areas highlighted for conservation action because of the richness of their biodiversity, its uniqueness and the level of threat that it faces.The Namaqualand Restoration Initiative (NRI) was founded by Dr. Peter Carrick (programme director & ecologist), of the Plant Conservation Unit of the University of Cape Town in 2005, with the aim of restoring areas damaged by mining. Previously, ad hoc restoration activities of mined-out areas have been ongoing by different mine operators and farmers across Namaqualand, but a co-ordinated, scientifically-based approach was lacking. The NRI emphasizes engagement with mine operators, capturing the expertise of restoration practitioners and use of scientifically based field experiments to develop novel restoration methods.In addition to the start-up capital provided by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF)/Succulent Karoo Ecosystem Programme (SKEP), the NRI has received further funding from De Beers Namaqualand Mines. De Beers has also committed to financially support small businesses to do contract restoration work on their mined areas, and these teams will be trained according to the guidelines and methods developed by the NRI. These businesses will be run by restoration managers who will each manage a small team of people to do restoration.Mining & Resource Extraction Diamond mining or prospecting occurs in discontinuous patches along virtually all 400 kilometers of the Namaqualand coastline. Diamonds tend to lie in narrow seams up to 50 meters below the surface, and despite the relatively rich soil even in this arid habitat, open cast mining is the norm.
Historically, mines have been left open, with huge piles of “overburden” – the soil and sand that lie over the mineral deposits – on either side. Legislation passed in the last 15 years requires mining companies to restore the land to a state where it can support new land uses, which in Namaqualand is primarily livestock grazing.
Some operators have begun to implement basic rehabilitation efforts, but more often than not, this means merely shoving back what has been mined, irrespective of its complex original layering. In many areas, the layer of topsoil is as thin as 5 centimeters and even if it does get replaced correctly, it can quickly be eroded by the wind. Furthermore, most of the indigenous perennials so crucial for ecological recovery stand little chance of re-establishing themselves without assistance. The rich biodiversity of the Succulent Karoo hotspot is due to an extensive and complex array of habitat types derived from topographical and climatic diversity in the region’s rugged mountains, semi-arid shrublands and coastal dunes. The hallmark of the hotspot is its exceptionally diverse and unique flora, especially succulents and bulbs. Many species are extreme habitat specialists, mainly related to soil type and of limited range size. Local endemism (i.e. the restriction of species to extremely small ranges of <50 km2) is most pronounced among bulbs and Mesembryanthemaceae and other succulents. Similar patterns of compositional change along gradients have been observed for certain groups of invertebrates. In addition to invertebrates, faunal diversity and endemism is high for reptiles, amphibians and some mammals. The primary goals of NRI are to establish a restoration benchmark and develop new and effective regional protocols, based on sound ecological dynamics, to achieve near natural biodiversity restoration after mining operations. This should be done while giving a cross section of the regional community a greater role in restoration in the project region. Mining operators and other land users should be engaged to fundamentally change the way they perceive their roles and responsibilities with regard to biodiversity conservation and restoration.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The NRI was created by Dr. Peter Carrick, an ecologist at the Plant Conservation Unit of the University of Cape Town, and is one of many projects in the CEPF/SKEP initiative. It has received funding from both CEPF/SKEP and the DeBeers Group, the world’s largest diamond mining company. The project intends to train and employ native Namaqualanders in the restoration of sites in the project region.

Description of Project Activities: NRI team members interviewed farmers, mine operators, agricultural scientists, and restoration business owners to synthesize local, working knowledge of restoration techniques in the succulent karoo ecosystem. The knowledge gleaned from these interviews was used to develop guidelines and highlight gaps where more knowledge or scientific work was needed. One identified gap was the difficulty of establishing non-succulent perennial species on restored areas.

 Another team then undertook field experiments to decipher the ecological requirements for establishing a diversity of perennial species on mined areas. They discovered that the first four to five months are the most critical for seedlings. Once  seedlings have survived these first few months, they tend to make it through the dry summer season.  NRI staff used the knowledge gained from these studies to begin testing ""restoration packs"" for mining companies to use in re-establishing indigenous plant communities that will, in turn, help stabilize ecosystems in the degraded areas. In addition to providing background information on the area, these packages contain seeds and equipment for planting.  Seedlings are given all help possible--they are planted in boxes to provide extra protection from wind, and nutrients and water are added to give them an extra boost to help them establish good roots as fast as possible. 1,300 small plots were planted with 16 indigenous perennial species, and seedling survival is still being monitored. The treatment combination yielding the best results should be determined by the end of 2007.  

NRI has also founded a new restoration business, NM Restoration, which is fully owned and run by three Namaqualanders. The NRI team held an intensive five day restoration training course in Namaqualand, which was attended by 47 candidates selected from 150 applicants. The trainees learned the techniques for successful restoration, including proper handling of topsoil, identification of local plant species to be used in restoration, methods of selecting, harvesting and storing viable seed, as well as methods of planting the seeds so as to achieve the greatest success, which includes protecting them from the wind of Namaqualand and ameliorating the soil altered by the mining process.  Forty trainees successfully completed the course, 15 of whom have been employed by the newly established restoration business operating in its pilot year. More jobs will become available when NM Restoration expands its operations in the near future. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: NRI's accomplishments so far have included two major strands:

1.  By ecological experiment and observation, NRI staff have developed a thorough understanding of the underlying ecological dynamics and the constraints on plant establishment in Namaqualand systems.

2.  A complete picture of current restoration techniques has been compiled through interviews with practitioners and from the literature.

This research has enabled NRI staff to develop novel techniques that facilitate the recruitment and establishment of perennial species in the succulent karoo. Based on this knowledge, a handbook and restoration pack for restoration practitioners in the mining and agricultural sectors has been produced.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: While the mining industry has provided many jobs for the people of Namaqualand in the past, these operations are slowly grinding to a halt. The joint opportunity to create employment and restore the environment has been seized by the economic and environmental role that NRI and NM Restoration will fulfill.  As NRI trains teams of Namaqualanders in both ecological and business skills, mining companies will also be able to employ local people to implement restoration work.  By doing this, companies hope to address the ongoing resentment among some local communities that they have not benefited from the region's extraordinary mineral wealth.
NRI Staff, students, and a number of research, business and conservation partners are involved in restoration research and implementation as a result of this project. The NRI has provided a bridge between restoration science and practice, and has provided economic benefits and offered a stake in restoration activities to those most affected by restoration efforts in Namaqualand. Key objectives for the future include the continued training of local and regional experts who will act as restoration consultants for the mining and agricultural sectors. NRI plans to distribute its restoration handbook freely amongst land-users in Namaqualand.
Another component of this programme is the commitment by the University of Cape Town’s Plant Conservation Unit (PCU) to Renu-Karro Veld Restoration cc. This initiative, established in 2007, is based in Prince Albert and aims to use local plants to restore degraded lands, thereby sustaining local services and generating sustainable livelihoods. The PCU will engage with Renu-Karoo through limited financial support and restoration research once projects become available and student interest develops. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/kenya-dryland-rehabilitation-and-community-resources-management-by-the-elangata-wuas-ecosystem-management-programme-kajiado-district/	Kenya: Dryland Rehabilitation and Community Resources Management by the Elangata Wuas Ecosystem Management Programme (Kajiado District)	Kenya	1992-06-25	2008-01-25	"The Kenyan Maasai peoples’ pastoral lifestyle has been curtailed since the coming of the colonial government to the present day. First, their movement was restricted South of the Uganda railway line in 1912 leading to heavy loss of prime pasture land including dry season grazing areas, salt licks and watering points. Nomadic pastoralism was perceived then as a retrogressive land use system and major cause of land degradation. In the early 1960s, the government of Kenya introduced a group ranch strategy as an alternative mode of land use in dryland areas, further restricting movement of the communities. In the programme area three group ranches comprising 160,000 ha were created: Elangata Wuas, Kilonito and Torosei. Today, the area is home to about 10,000 persons and 27,500 heads of cattle representing an overstocking rate of about 90%.Although the main economic activity of the Maasai communities remains raising cattle, the more recently imposed semi- nomadic and semi-sedentary system, along with further sub-division of group ranches and allocation of parcels to individual holdings, have led to heavy degradation of the natural resources base. This degradation has, in turn, led to growing poverty, loss of livestock, rising unemployment and declining health.The Elangata Wuas Ecosystem Management Programme (EWEMP) was formulated to address some of these problems. EWEMP is a partnership between the community in the Central Division of Kajiado District, the Centre for Biodiversity of the National Museums of Kenya (NMK) and the Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS). EWEMP was initiated in 1992 through discussions between the NMK and the KWS with the Elangata Wuas, Kilonito and Torosei communities in Kajiado District. Following a protracted planning and design process, EWEMP initiated pioneering field activities in 1998, and has subsequently strengthened promising ones from 2000.Agriculture & Livestock Degradation of natural resources that eventually lead to desertification is more pronounced in Africa than any of the other continents of the world. The present knowledge of land degradation/desertification in sub-saharan Africa reveals that the underlying human causes are firmly rooted in the socio-economic, political and cultural environment in which they operate. An understanding of these social dimensions and impacts, besides the physical factors, are necessary before any meaningful interventions are proposed or undertaken.
The main economic activity of the Maasai communities is raising cattle, in a semi- nomadic and semi-sedentary system. With sub-division of group ranches and allocation of parcels to individual holdings, the traditional nomadic livestock grazing patterns have been constrained. This, in addition to the absence of proven alternative land use technologies, has led to heavy degradation of the natural resources base, particularly of pastures, soil and water. Besides these bio-physical forms of land degradation, lack of experience and knowledge of benign land-management practices and technologies, including coping mechanisms under the new land use systems, has led to growing poverty, loss of livestock, rising unemployment and declining health in the communities. The women, old people and the youth are shouldering the bulk of the burden. Vegetation in this area is mainly Acacia- commiphora bushland and grasslands. The main tree and shrub species are Adansonia digitata, Acacia and Commiphora spp. Common perennial grasses include Cenchrus ciliaris, Chloris roxburghiana and Eragrostis superba. Wild herbivores have been surveyed frequently and their populations appear to be more stable than those of domestic herbivores. They comprise about 22% of the total livestock biomass in Kajiado District. However, wild herbivores are unevenly distributed over the District. The major species in terms of biomass are wildebeest, zebra, giraffe and eland. EWEMP’s broad objective is to develop methodologies for sustainable management of natural resources, rehabilitation of degraded sites, diversification of income generation, and an acceleration of transition into the cash economy for improved community livelihood.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Building a Community Based Organization and Governance Structures 
 
The programme has developed a Community-Based Organization (CBO) with a strong local foundation.  It provides sensitisation, mobilization, recruitment, empowerment and capacity building to the CBO to enable it undertake all local development programmes and sustainable management of resources to generate income for members.  Experiences gained so far show that the grounding of a credible CBO is contingent on establishment of a grass-root structure with legitimacy and recognition from stakeholders, and respect from the community. The members are concerned about transparency, accountability and equitable distribution of benefits.  It is only through assuring resource ownership by the community and equitable access to benefits that the participation of the community can be assured.  

Pasture Rehabilitation 
 
The results of assessment of the state of pasture had revealed that overgrazing pressure in the area over the last two decades or so have contributed to marked degradation of the vegetation and the ecosystem in general.  Successive trampling and selective grazing has subsequently led to dominance of unpalatable species of forbs and grasses, and invasion of weeds and woody plants.  This has concomitantly led to a reduction in the population of palatable woody plants, perennial forbs and grasses and an expansion of annual species. 
 
To reverse this trend the programme embarked on assessing the effectiveness of promising low cost technologies for mitigating the state of land degradation. The results of investigations carried out so far show that exclusion of grazing pressure, supported by erection of physical structures through construction of cascades of pits, a matrix of pegs drilled on the ground on the eroded surfaces across the contours, a series of stones and brush wood arranged across run-off channels, and broadcasting seeds of prime browse grasses such as Digitera macroblaphara, Pennisetum strameineum, Sporobolus pellicidus, and Dactyloctenium aegyptium seeds before the rain, have given promising intervention points.  The physical structures trap excessive water run-off thereby enhancing infiltration and promoting healing of degraded sites.  But it is critical to exclude the affected areas from grazing during treatment. 
 
A second major initiative began with exploring cost-effective techniques for rehabilitation and sustaining the pasture potentials in wooded areas.  The opening up of the wood-encroached sites was taken together with low impact harvesting for biomass production.  Managed removal of materials for fuelwood production makes possible a gradual opening up of the wooded areas and in time allows regeneration of prime browse perennial grasses.
 
Woodland Management 
 
This is one of the promising and key micro-enterprises in the programme area.  The programme has developed relevant databases on the woody resource that allows low impact off-take practice under a prescribed system of criteria and indicators for sustainable management.  The members of the woodland micro-enterprise have developed a mini co-operative whose members practice a 15-year felling cycle for charcoal production.  Each member produces 10 bags of charcoal monthly that she/he delivers to a sale yard from where it is marketed to charcoal dealers at negotiated unit prices. The micro-enterprise is managed by rules and guidelines developed and enforced by its members.  Currently members earn about KES 3000 (USD 40) per month from charcoal production.  
 
Consumptive and Non-consumptive Utilization of Wildlife 
 
The community is adamant that wildlife, which shares their land with livestock should justify its existence by providing some benefits to them.  Further, the programme recognizes that wildlife management and conservation depends on information on its numbers, distribution dynamics and the state of the range and the co-operation of the land-owners.  In this regard, factors influencing species abundance such as increases in human and livestock population and the peoples' attitude have been discussed and noted.  The programme has explored opportunities for generating income from wildlife and eco-tourism such as wildlife cropping, ostrich husbandry, beekeeping, filming, bird-shooting, home stays and cultural exchange. To date the community has established a wildlife utilization committee with representation from all stakeholders in the group ranch, and has been trained in animal scouting, population assessment and tour guiding. The committee is, however, still waiting for the government's guidelines on cropping and the inauguration of the micro-enterprise. 
  
Eco-tourism 
 
The programme has established a base camp with satellite camping sites and a network of recreational activities as a nucleus for its eco-tourism micro-enterprise. Since the launching of the eco-tourism micro- enterprise over one year ago, over 500 visitors have visited the area as individuals and organized groups from institutions, as nature lovers, researchers, or on learning/training missions, using the programme's facilities. The community earned over KES1 million (USD 13,333) from its eco-tourism micro-enterprise during 2000.   
 
Ostrich Husbandry by Pastoralists 
 
Experiences from ostrich husbandry show that the community is able to produce birds cheaply for meat and breeding at a cost of KES 4,000 (USD 53.3) per bird, over a period of 25 to 30 months.  The birds are herded with sheep and goats at no extra cost and fetch between KES 10,000 (USD 133.3) and 20,000 (USD 266.7) each.  By contrast, a mature bird fetches KES 75,000 (USD 1,000) in the export market.  Prevailing poor market structure and lack of a clear government policy on ostrich production remain serious constraints to the development of this micro-enterprise.  In the year 2000, the 12 participating community members earned KES 20,0000 (USD 2,666.7) from the sale of 23 month old ostriches.   
 
Beekeeping 
 
This activity has attracted 20 farmers all of whom have adopted Kenya top bar hives.  The programme runs a nucleus production unit at the base camp and provides participating families with backup training and hive management, harvesting and honey processing.  Each farmer harvests 10-15kg of honey, two to three times a year, with 1 kg  of honey fetching KES 250.00 (USD 3.3).  

Sustainable Use of the Sand Resources 
 
Sand harvesting along the River Toroka has become an important source of income.  The area is readily accessible to lorries particularly during the wet season when roads to other sand producing areas are impassable.  This has led to heavy and non-sustainable off-take of building sand.  On realizing that heavy sand harvesting affects ground water levels and hence negatively impacts on the wells downstream, the community decided to carry out a study to:  

 -  Determine the volume of sand resources in a specified area along the river; the characteristics of the sand beds, the seasonal variation in the water table and the effect of sand harvesting on the 
water levels on the wells along the river bed; 
 
 -  Evaluate the general condition of groundwater along the Toroka River so as to identify sites for 
drilling boreholes to supplement existing water supplies; carry out a monitoring of sand harvesting intensity and natural sand recharge rates, and fluctuations in the levels of aquifers in the area, and hence generate basic data for building a Geographical Information System (GIS) for further rigorous analysis, modelling and generating land-use information.  

Available information shows that about 400,000 tons of sand can be harvested per year from the river segment under the study sustainably.  This is valued at KES 20 million (USD 267,000) of which KES19 million (USD 253,000) should go to the community.  
  
 Women in Development 
 
A total of 10 women groups, registered with the Ministry of Culture and Social Services are operating in the area.  The women groups have excelled in managing income-generating activities. The programme supports and empowers them through training on product development and quality control in making artefacts and handicrafts. The women are currently earning an average of KES 800 monthly on an investment of about one hour per day working four to five days per week. Lately they have also been involved in vegetable production using drip irrigation. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The programme has accumulated useful working information in promising components of biophysical, socio-economic and cultural aspects of resources management.  The team of researchers and their visiting partners have worked supportively, cross-sectorally among themselves, and with members of the community.  The programme has established a cohesive local level resource governance structure that has taken ownership of the programme. 

Although the micro-enterprises are not fully functional, the initial level of flow of benefits, particularly from the biomass energy, eco-tourism and sand harvesting activities, has caught the attention and interest of members.  Consequently, the list of members has doubled, and the community  has become actively involved in ecosystem rehabilitation, fighting game poaching, active participation in the micro-enterprises, and other activities of the programme.  The enhanced level of interest in the programme was accurately portrayed by the recent experiences in the elections of the PPC and PMC that were vibrant with serious lobbying, canvasing and campaigns.  Unlike the previous elections, people  turned up in large numbers under various groupings:  clans, age sets etc. as a strategy for out smarting one another in electing candidates into the programme's committees. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Prevailing poor market structure and lack of a clear government policy on certain micro-enterprises remain serious constraints to their development.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The programme's approach is based on building a participatory partnership that places people and their needs at the centre of natural resource management (NRM) for sustainable development.  It is noticeable that the community has started to appreciate  EWEMP's approach that focuses on community empowerment and capacity-building for self-development.  By contrast, other community-based projects often give direct support to individuals or institutions, such as granting school fees for needy families or roofing and water-storage materials, but finally leave the communities unchanged.
It is evident that the processes of empowerment and capacity building initiated in the programme area will nurture the CBO into a dependable vehicle for managing change and development in the area. Results of the research effort in dryland resources management are also encouraging, although many of these have not covered both the good and bad rain years. Generally, members are convinced that with effective marketing of their products they would build new income sources, establish sustainable locally-based economic activities and finally shift from traditional reliance on pastoralism. It is at this stage, that the message on destocking (over-stocking currently stands at 90% and remains a major course of land degradation) and adoption of non-degrading land use systems, will be meaningful.
The main reasons leading to the success of the project include:
– Project planning is based entirely on local resource base and needs;
– Project activities are tailored to fit, as much as possible, the traditional and cultural values of the Maasai community;
– Project implementation has adopted the traditional structure of the Maasai Community governance, respecting also the gender roles;
– Consistent capacity building in CBO involved in the project;
– Need driven supportive research has redirected the development strategies and technical requirements for success;
– Financial inputs to the Project have been minimised to increase the capacity of Maasai communities to contribute to their commitments;
– The Project has adopted a strategy of cost sharing, both financial and in-kind, where financial inputs by local communities will increase with time through the generated revenue and thus ensure sustainability of the activities in future. Policy
This programme demonstrates a fully integrated natural resource management initiative in the drylands and useful learning points, especially with regard to wildlife. It is recommended that the government put in place enabling policy in support of community participation in wildlife management.
Management
The CBO and governance structure being established is a useful organ for empowering the community in sustainable management of the natural resources. Its organization and strengthening need to be finalized during the current phase of the project.
Research
Further studies are still needed in sustainable woodland management, building on criteria and indicators already developed and community management of wildlife resources including marketing and benefit sharing. "

It is one of the 34 richest and most threatened reservoirs of plant and animal life on Earth. These biodiversity hotspots cover only 2.3 percent of the planet, yet contain 77 percent of all terrestrial species diversity.The Succulent Karoo Ecosystem Programme (SKEP) is the result of a one-year planning process which combined a rigorous scientific process with broad land-user participation to identify and generate broad consensus around an ultimate vision and set of conservation targets for the Succulent Karoo. This process was initiated in September 2001 and completed one year later. It was facilitated by Conservation International’s (CI) Southern Africa Hotspots ProgramÂ and formed part of theÂ Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund’s (CEPF) preparation to expand its investment to the hotspot. The Succulent Karoo hotspot is an appropriate recipient of CEPF investment for several reasons. The region’s levels of plant diversity and endemism rival those of rain forests, making the Succulent Karoo an extraordinary exception to the low diversity typical of arid areas and the only arid ecosystem to be recognized as a global biodiversity hotspot. Nearly one-third of the floral species of the region are unique to the hotspot and the region boasts the richest variety of succulent flora in the world (just under one-third of the Succulent Karoo’s flora are succulents). In addition to its floral diversity, the hotspot is a center of diversity for reptiles and many groups of invertebrates.The Succulent Karoo is under extreme pressure from human activities, including overgrazing, mining, illegal collection of wild plants and animals and the impact of climate change. However, there are many opportunities for conserving the hotspot’s remarkable biodiversity due to the low human population density, large areas of extant (albeit severely grazed in places) habitat, low costs of conservation in most of the region and good opportunities for biodiversity-friendly forms of land use in many areas.Six strategic directions guide CEPF’s approach in the Succulent Karoo:1. Expand protected area corridors through public-private-communal partnerships in the priority areas of Bushmanland Inselbergs, Central Namaqualand Coast, Namaqualand Uplands, Knersvlakte, Hantam-Roggeveld, Central Little Karoo, and Sperrgebiet2. Engage key industrial sectors in meeting conservation objectives identified by SKEP3. Retain and restore critical biodiversity in areas under greatest land-use pressure4. Mainstream conservation priorities into land-use planning and policymaking5. Increase awareness of the Succulent Karoo Hotspot6. Create the capacity to catalyze the SKEP programAgriculture & Livestock, Mining & Resource Extraction The hotspot is vulnerable to several land use pressures, particularly overgrazing on communal lands, ostrich farming in the southeast, mining and the illegal collection of plants and animals for trade. Anthropogenic climate change is predicted to have a serious impact on the region’s biodiversity.
Agriculture: The most extensive pressure on biodiversity in the Succulent Karoo is livestock grazing. Goat, sheep, ostrich and small game ranching are the dominant land uses in approximately 90 percent of the hotspot and although stock limits and grazing plans exist for much of the hotspot, signs of overgrazing are evident over much of the landscape. This is particularly true in communal lands where motives for maintaining livestock numbers that exceed the capacity are not simply profit driven and where limited incentives and economic alternatives exist. Ostrich grazing, unlike small livestock grazing, tremendously impacts veld by selective grazing of high protein plants and seeds and compacting soil, effectively creating dust bowls.
Mining: The entire northern extension of the Succulent Karoo is mineral rich and with various mining applications pending throughout the region, transformation from mining operations represents a significant pressure. Open caste and alluvial mining activities for diamonds along the coast and river flood plains have nearly transformed the entire coastline. New markets and discoveries of base metals such as zinc and copper as well as gypsum and quartz deposits continue to transform large areas of limited habitat types. In addition to large corporations, uncontrolled prospecting by smaller companies and individuals is encroaching on the fragment patches of dune and coastal shrubland.
Other direct pressures: In addition to these indiscriminate pressures, collection of rare and commercially valuable species is a pressure as is an increase of unregulated tourism activities in many fragile ecosystems. Thus, although the increase in tourism to the region could certainly help create an opportunity for biodiversity conservation, it is currently having a negative impact on numerous species. The rich biodiversity of the Succulent Karoo hotspot is due to an extensive and complex array of habitat types derived from topographical and climatic diversity in the region’s rugged mountains, semi-arid shrublands and coastal dunes. The hallmark of the hotspot is its exceptionally diverse and unique flora, especially succulents and bulbs. Many species are extreme habitat specialists, mainly related to soil type and of limited range size. Local endemism (i.e. the restriction of species to extremely small ranges of <50 km2) is most pronounced among bulbs and Mesembryanthemaceae and other succulents. Similar patterns of compositional change along gradients have been observed for certain groups of invertebrates. In addition to invertebrates, faunal diversity and endemism is high for reptiles, amphibians and some mammals. The overarching vision of SKEP is that “The people of the Succulent Karoo take ownership of and enjoy their unique living landscape in a way that maintains biodiversity and improves livelihoods now and into perpetuity.”
The specific 20-year conservation targets that have been identified thus far for the Succulent Karoo are:
1. 75 percent of the conservation targets set in the SKEP process for 135 vegetation types will be protected and conserved.
2. Key climatic gradients and riverine corridors are taken into consideration in the creation or expansion of any protected areas.
3. Globally threatened and endangered species listed in the Red Data sources will be under additional protection.
4. Sites in the Succulent Karoo hotspot that house unique, endemic and globally threatened species will be identified and protected.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF) is designed to safeguard the world’s threatened biodiversity hotspots in developing countries. It is a joint initiative of Conservation International (CI), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Government of Japan, the MacArthur Foundation and the World Bank. CEPF supports projects in hotspots, areas with more than 60 percent of the Earth’s terrestrial species in just 1.4 percent of its land surface. A fundamental purpose of CEPF is to ensure that civil society is engaged in efforts to conserve biodiversity in the hotspots. An additional purpose is to ensure that those efforts complement existing strategies and frameworks established by local, regional and national governments.
The SKEP process involved more than 60 scientific experts and over 400 local stakeholders representing government, academia, nongovernmental organizations, private sector interests, and local communities. SKEP developed an overarching framework for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development in the hotspot.

Description of Project Activities: Nearly 90 individual projects, carried out by a variety of implementing agencies, have been initiated since the completion of the SKEP process in 2002.  A list and description of each individual project can be found at http://www.skep.org/projects.php.  Although varying widely in specific purpose and geographical focus, each project is included in one of the six CEPF strategic funding directions: 

1.  Expand protected area corridors through public-private-communal partnerships in specific geographic priorities 

This funding direction is aimed at undertaking specific catalytic activities that will assist in the expansion of the Succulent Karoo hotspot's protected area system through the establishment of five large conservation corridors (or megareserves). When implemented, these corridors should be sufficiently large to achieve conservation targets for numerous Red List species and many vegetation types. In addition, they should be able to accommodate a wide range of processes, including large mammal migration routes, riverine corridors and climatic gradients. The incorporation of the last-mentioned feature should provide resilience to climate change. 
  
A major obstacle to implementing projects of this scale is a lack of capacity among conservation agencies. Consequently, CEPF's niche within the larger objective is to establish project management teams which can catalyze planning and specific implementation of key activities that will build the momentum required to eventually establish five large conservation corridors. These teams, appointed under the auspices of an appropriate nongovernmental organization, should work in close partnership with the appropriate conservation agency and provide mentorship for officials of the agency that will ultimately inherit the project. These teams that will include individuals with project management, community extension, and conservation planning expertise will develop strategies for creating new protected areas that enjoy support and generate benefits for a broad range of stakeholders. These teams, will be responsible for securing local stakeholder participation, necessary political buy-in, consolidating baseline information on biodiversity for long-term monitoring, developing management plans that formalize roles of each partner, and creating strategies for long-term financial sustainability.  Such a model is being piloted for the Baviaanskloof megareserve in the Cape Floristic Region, where the provincial conservation agency has provided substantive co-funding. 
  
Wherever possible, these projects should build on and be integrated with existing projects in and around the respective priority areas. For example, the potential synergies between the Cederberg and Gouritz megareserves (being implemented as part of the Cape Action Plan for the Environment) and the Hantam-Roggeveld and Central Little Karoo megareserves, respectively, should be expanded. 
  
2.  Engage key industrial sectors in meeting conservation objectives identified by SKEP 

Many potential partnerships exist between the conservation community and key industrial sectors in the Succulent Karoo hotspot that could lead to positive conservation outcomes. This funding direction will target these sectors by building relationships with key stakeholders and exposing them to opportunities for enhancing their business interests while simultaneously meeting conservation objectives. These include industries based on resources that constitute high opportunity costs for conservation (e.g. mining, ostrich ranching) as well as those whose objectives are potentially aligned with conservation (e.g. ecotourism, wildlife ranching). 
  
3.  Retain and restore critical biodiversity in areas under greatest land use pressure 

The achievement of conservation targets in landscapes subject to severe land use pressures, where extant habitat is often fragmented, is a huge challenge for conservation. This funding direction will address this challenge through the identification of spatial priorities at the fine-scale (1:10,000  -  1:50,000) and the investigation of mechanisms to create small reserves and reduce pressures on the unreserved remnants. 
  
4.  Mainstream conservation planning outcomes in land-use planning and decision-making 

In both Namibia and South Africa, decisions regarding land use have been devolved to local or district municipalities. These municipalities are legally bound to prepare spatial plans and associated development priorities for investment every five years. Local government legislation requires these plans to incorporate biodiversity concerns. This legislation provides an excellent opportunity to mainstream biodiversity concerns into land use planning and practice. Unfortunately, most local government agencies in the Succulent Karoo hotspot do not have the capacity to produce the appropriate information on biodiversity as well as the ability to use such information, even if it were provided. This strategic funding direction is aimed at providing the appropriate biodiversity products for municipal-level planning and increasing the capacity of officials to use these products. The associated projects should draw on the experience gained from similar exercises in the Cape Floristic Region and the Subtropical Ecosystem Planning Project planning domain. The intention should be to build core capacity for generating and updating products, and for providing training within the provincial conservation agency of the Northern Cape as well as within the Conservation Planning Unit of the Western Cape Nature Conservation Board. 
  
5.  Increase awareness of the Succulent Karoo hotspot  

Unlike the adjacent Cape Floristic Region hotspot, where the ""fynbos"" and ""Cape Floral Kingdom"" names are widely known, awareness of the Succulent Karoo's unique biodiversity status is relatively poorly developed at the local, regional and national levels. This funding direction will meet the urgent need to promote awareness of the hotspot from local to national scales, through support to projects such as a well-coordinated binational awareness campaign. Within this strategic direction, CEPF will also support efforts to publicize the biological importance of the Succulent Karoo hotspot and educate stakeholders about threatened and unique species from the Succulent Karoo as flagship species. 
  
6.  Create capacity to catalyze the SKEP program 

Effective identification and implementation of projects consistent with CEPF investment priorities and the larger 20-year SKEP vision will require a proactive approach to catalyzing targeted activities that will build the momentum required to conserve the Succulent Karoo hotspot. These include the establishment of a small grants fund and a network of champions to identify, mentor and monitor small-scale projects, which can be undertaken at a local scale and involve largely, but not exclusively, disadvantaged communities. Champion teams may also become involved in larger projects occurring within their subregions and will hopefully participate in or influence local government deliberations that deal with biodiversity concerns. 
  
This funding direction will also establish a coordination unit for implementing SKEP, including the CEPF investment priorities identified above. As per agreed policy, this unit will be incorporated into the Bioregional Planning Unit of South Africa's National Botanical Institute (soon to become the National Biodiversity Institute). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Approximately 60 individual projects in the Succulent Karoo ecoregion, focusing on 9 geographical priority areas, have been completed since the SKEP process was completed in 2002.  These projects address a wide range of goals and strategies outlined by SKEP. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Despite the documented diversity of the hotspot, global and local awareness of the significance and value of the Succulent Karoo is scant. While funding to secure land has made substantial progress, lack of funding to develop and manage these resources has resulted in a situation where the parks are largely protected only on paper. Grazing, collection of wildlife for trade and mining and prospecting continue unabated in some areas.  
 
The complex sociopolitical environment also impacts the levels of protection for biodiversity in the hotspot.  Two countries, three provincial/regional governments and more than 50 local government bodies are located within the hotspot.  Decentralization of many of the administrative functions of the South African and Nambian governments to the provincial (regional in Namibia) and municipal levels has led to the expansion of the role of local government in conservation and land-use issues.  Building the capacity of staff in local government to integrate biodiversity concerns into their planning and regulatory practices is an important opportunity for civil society to participate in and influence long-term planning for conservation.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Available socioeconomic data indicate that CEPF-supported projects in the Succulent Karoo of South Africa and Namibia often occur in rural areas with a high level of poverty.  Within these areas of poverty, CEPF grantees tend to focus largely on poorer households that are indigenous, have little or no land, or depend directly on wild resources as subsistence hunter-gatherers.  CEPF projects directly and indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and improve human conditions in these regions while achieving their primary objective of biodiversity conservation. Direct impacts include creating jobs and providing training to local peoples.  Indirect impacts include creating local organizations, strengthening civil societies, and other activities that maintain and restore the ecosystems upon which many poor people in the Succulent Karoo rely.
The Succulent Karoo is one of the biological wonders of the world, with unrivaled levels of diversity and endemism for an arid area. The increasing threats to this unique region have compelled significant global, national and local commitment to a comprehensive plan for its conservation: the Succulent Karoo Ecosystem Plan. CEPF provides a source of funding in the Succulent Karoo designed to reach NGOs in a way that complements funding for government agencies and other stakeholders; supports the framework established by SKEP; ensures that civil society has an opportunity to contribute to conservation; and provides a flexible, responsive funding mechanism for innovative conservation activities. By aligning its focus with the conservation and sustainable development goals of SKEP, CEPF will augment efforts to address immediate threats and contribute to long-term conservation in the hotspot, developing a model of sustainable regional conservation efforts that could be replicated in other arid regions facing similar pressures and in other biodiversity hotspots around the world.
The momentum generated by the stakeholder process for developing this profile and existing capacity in the region provides an opportunity for CEPF to support priority actions within the SKEP framework that will secure areas for conservation, build the capacity for a programmatic approach and conserve the Succulent Karoo’s biodiversity in perpetuity. The CEPF monitoring approach focuses on monitoring and evaluating performance and impact of the overall program, as well at the ecosystem and individual project levels. The three levels will be carefully integrated to build linkages between the program’s overall purpose, the strategic directions and investment priorities identified to achieve selected conservation targets in the many projects that CEPF supports.
The SKEP 20-year strategy is derived directly from the people living in the Succulent Karoo, and confirmed and augmented by the scientific community, national and regional-level stakeholders through the SKEP process. The strategy consists of a comprehensive set of actions that will achieve conservation targets by addressing constraints and maximizing opportunities that are most relevant for each sub-region. These actions are summarized as a series of four strategic focal areas:
1. Increasing awareness”¨
2. Expanding Protected Areas”¨
3. Harmonious Land Uses”¨
4. Institutional Coordination.
Though far-reaching and widely supported, it is recognized that SKEP is a living strategy and these priority actions and strategic emphases will evolve over time. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/mexico-nuevo-leon-restoration-of-dwarf-pine-pinus-culminicola-in-the-cerro-el-potosi/	Mexico: Nuevo Leon: Restoration of Dwarf Pine (Pinus culminicola) in the Cerro El Potosi	Mexico	1997-11-01	2001-11-01	"This small pilot experiment was designed to test the effects of cattle, small mammals, and elevation on the success of restoration of an endemic dwarf pine species in northeastern Mexico. Pinus culminicola grows only in four high peaks in the Sierra Madre Oriental and is under pressure from grazing, wildï¬res, and human activities such as mining, road development for timber extraction, and telecommunication and aerial navigation devices. The study planted and monitored 2-year-old seedlings at three elevations within the natural distribution range of this species at Cerro El PotosÄ± in Nuevo Leon, Mexico. At each elevation three treatments were established: (1) seedlings protected from cattle plus small mammals, (2) seedlings protected from cattle, and (3) seedlings with free access to cattle and small mammals. Seedling survival was approximately 50% in (1) after 4 years, but there were no surviving seedlings with free access to cattle. Elevation in general did not account for variation in survival. Seedling growth was poor during the 4 years, which implies that seedlings remain susceptible to grazing and trampling by cattle and small mammals.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation, Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Dwarf pine (P. culminicola) was described by Andresen and Beaman (1961) as a new species endemic to Cerro El PotosÄ±. Later the same authors described the distribution of the species as a total of 106 ha (Beaman & Andresen 1966). In 1975 the species was also found in three other sites of the same Sierra (Sierra La Marta and Sierra La Viga in the state of Coahuila, and Cerro Pena Nevada in Nuevo Leon) with similar spatial patterns and altitudinal distribution ranges to those determined for Cerro El PotosÄ±. In 1978 wildï¬res at Cerro El PotosÄ± burned 34% of the dwarf pine population. During the past four decades, a reduction of the area formerly covered by dwarf pine has been observed, due to human impact involving timber extraction, road building, and land use change for the development of telecommunication and aerial navigation infrastructure. A manganese mine was opened and later abandoned in the region. Recently (1998), several wildï¬res drastically reduced the area formerly covered by dwarf pine at Cerro El PotosÄ±. Currently, only 30 ha of fragmented dwarf pine area exist at Cerro El PotosÄ±, and these include many old trees with low seed production that are subject to cattle grazing. The species is now considered endemic and is subject to special protection. There are no studies of P. culminicola populations in the other mountains where it occurs; unfortunately these areas are not protected and are also subjected to grazing and wildï¬res. Dwarf pine was first found in the summit area of Cerro Potosí in Nuevo León in 1959. This is the most extensive known population. Three or four small populations are also recorded on the high ridges about 50 km northwest of there on the Nuevo León-Coahuila border. Soils are rocky and calcareous. It grows at 2965-3700 m, the highest mean elevaton of any pine. Since its current distribution includes only the highest elevations on summits within its range, it must be regarded as severely at risk of extinction due to global warming. Existing climate parameters are not well-known due to a lack of weather stations at these summits. On Cerro Potosí the species is at its lower elevational limits as an understory shrub with Agave and grasses in an open P. hartwegii-P. ayacahuite forest. With increasing elevation and site exposure, the erect pines yield dominance to P. culminicola, and at the summit it forms extensive mats interspersed with occasional gnarled and stunted P. hartwegii. The pine mats carry fire well; with areas of up to several dozen hectares have burned in recent years on various sides of the mountain, an overall pattern apparently consistent with an hypothesis of stand replacing fire at timescales of 50 to 200 years, although this would obviously be responsive to anthropogenic ignitions, which are quite possible at this easily accessible site. Farjon and Styles (1997) report that at lower elevations, in the Sierra La Marta, Coahuila, P. culminicola grows in a scrub community with Quercus spp., Arctostaphylos, Ceanothus, Agave, and grasses; on the Cerro La Viega and the Sierra de Arteaga, Coahuila, they grow in a similar community that also includes Abies and Pseudotsuga (species not specified). Fragmentation and habitat loss are the main threats to the survival of most endangered species; hence, the inclusion of dynamic processes of plant communities in restoration plans would result in lower habitat loss and fragmentation. Lesica and Allendorf (1999) argue that a primary goal of restoration is the establishment of long-term viable populations that will restore ecosystem functions and processes, prevent erosion, and protect biological diversity. In spite of the uniqueness of the species, there are few published studies of the ecology of dwarf pine. Garza et al. (2002) described a high fungal diversity (51 species of macromycetes from 19 families and 42 genera) associated with P. culminicola. Aguirre et al. (2001) described the vegetation types of the area and examined the stem density pattern of P. culminicola and P. hartwegii and found the former to be more abundant at higher elevations. In this study we tested restoration techniques for P. culminicola, through replanting and the use of herbivore exclosures in the protected natural area Cerro El PotosÄ±, within its natural distribution range.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Given the protected status of the Cerro El Potosi the habitat of Dwarf pine is protected by Mexican law. The researchers in this case were evaluating the effects of grazing on the reproduction of the species, and the limited range of the species and the continuation of grazing in these high altitude prairie habitats make the involvement of local ranchers critical to the species’ continued survival. The researchers found that free range grazing decimated the endemic reproduction as well as the restoration efforts, indicating that restoration efforts required management plans to address grazing in these habitats.

Description of Project Activities: The experiment was laid out in December 1997 at three elevations and vegetation types: (1) high elevation at 3,500 m in Pinus culminicola matorral, (2) intermediate elevation at 3,400 m in P. culminicola - P. hartwegii forest, and (3) lower elevation at 3,300 m in P. hartwegii - P. culminicola forest. At each elevation three square plots of 625 m2 were established for planting 2-year-old dwarf pine seedlings that had been grown in a seedling nursery. Three treatments were made for each plot: (1) small mammal plus cattle exclusion (chicken wire), (2) cattle exclusion (barbed wire), and (3) free range. For each treatment at each elevation, 110 seedlings were planted at a density of approximately 2 seedlings in each 10 square meters. At the time of planting, seedlings were approximately 100 mm tall and 5 mm in stem diameter. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Both elevation and exclosure were found to have an effect on seedling survival for the duration of the experiment. Seedling mortality was high in all treatments, with only about 50% of seedlings surviving 4 years after planting in the areas excluded for cattle and small mammals. Seedling survival was signiï¬cantly higher in areas excluded from both cattle and small vertebrates than in areas with cattle exclosures only. Survival was much lower where no exclosure was used. Many seedlings in the free-range treatment were grazed and trampled, although this did not happen uniformly to all seedlings. This implies that grazing is low and erratic in the area. However, 2 years after planting, more than 80% of seedlings had died at the highest elevation. By the fourth year after planting, no free-range seedlings had survived at any elevation. Where small mammals were not excluded, seedlings were found to be nibbled and occasionally had broken stems. This damage was also present, although rarely, in the area excluded for cattle plus small mammals, where it was attributed to the parrots that are common in the area or to small mammals that may have climbed over or burrowed under the chicken wire fence. In general, elevation did not account for differences in seedling survival; the patterns found for exclosures were consistent at all elevations. The fact that seedling survival was constant between environments suggests that seedling mortality during these ï¬rst years is the result of seedling vigor rather than competition. However, in 1999 seedling mortality was consistently greater at the highest elevation where the surrounding vegetation is Pinus culminicola matorral, perhaps as a result of a very harsh winter. Mean stem diameter for all seedlings was low during 1998 (5.09 mm), 1999 (5.15 mm), and 2000 (5.66 mm), perhaps at the expense of root growth. In 2001 stem diameter increased to 8.07 mm. There were no differences in stem diameter that could be attributed to elevation or access to cattle and small mammals.  Seedlings doubled their height since planting in 1997 and 2001. The increase in height was smaller during 1998 - 2000 than in 2001, perhaps as a result of early root growth. The ï¬nal mean seedling height was approximately 120 mm. After 4 years in the ï¬eld, plants were still very short and hence in the layer where trampling and grazing by cattle and small mammals may occur. There was a tendency for seedlings to be taller at the lowest elevation (3,300 m). Whether this is a result of better growing conditions or heavier shade remains to be tested. Seedlings excluded from small mammals also had a tendency to be taller, perhaps as a result of occasional nibbling of shoots of unprotected seedlings. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: In addition to low density of Pinus culminicola due to habitat loss and wildfire, the study found low levels of natural and planted seedling recruitment to be a further threat to this endemic species. Naturally emerging seedlings were not detected during the 4 years of the study. It is possible that seeds were consumed by rodents, as found for other habitats, or that conditions for seedling establishment occurred in events that do not happen annually, such as masting or above-average spring rainfall. Elevation in general did not account for variations in survival, which is in agreement with distribution of the species within Cerro El PotosÄ± as described by Aguirre et al. (2001). Seedling growth was poor during the 4 years, which implies that seedlings remained susceptible to grazing and trampling by cattle and small mammals. In this study we have shown that free-range cattle severely limit seedling recruitment; hence, its special protection status (Diario Oï¬cial de la Federacion 2000) should be followed by management plans that exclude free-range cattle, and perhaps seed-consuming parrots and rodents, from restoration areas. Seedling planting is a must given that natural germination was not observed during the study. Reforestation programs in Mexico do not traditionally evaluate survival of planted seedlings or saplings. However, because the omnipresent cattle are typically not excluded, it is believed that plant mortality must be very high, and thus further studies dealing with the impact of herbivory and trampling after reforestation should be encouraged throughout Mexico. Seedling survival was poor after 4 years for seedlings protected from cattle and small mammals, and no seedlings survived after being exposed to grazing and trampling for 3 - 4 years. Mortality was similar at all sites in spite of differences in environments and plant communities present at different elevations. After 4 years, surviving seedlings were still very small and thus susceptible to trampling and grazing by both cattle and small mammals.
There were no naturally occurring seedlings found in this study; hence, it appears that replanting will be necessary to ensure the continued survival of this endemic species. In addition to protection of natural populations of dwarf pine from wildï¬res, reforestation programs that include protection for seedlings from cattle and small mammals should be implemented. All planted seedlings were labeled so they could distinguished from any naturally established seedlings. The study monitored seedlings annually from November 1998 to November 2001. Plant survival was determined by checking the position of each planted seedling. Stem diameter and total height were measured for all surviving seedlings. To test whether grazing and elevation affected seedling survival, we used a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). To test whether elevation affected seedling growth in diameter and height, we used one-way ANOVA. "

Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) and Tri-State Generation joined the partnership in 2004. These organizations formed a collaborative to restore and sustain the ecological, social, cultural and economic values of the Uncompahgre Plateau. The UP area, located in southwest Colorado, comprises over 1.5 million acres of private, state and federal lands. Approximately 75% of the area is public land.The goals of the UP Project are 1) to improve ecosystem health on the Uncompahgre Plateau through active management based on best available science and local community interests and 2) to partner with others in the restoration of native plant communities on the Colorado Plateau. The primary role of UP is to help coordinate and facilitate restoration activities on the Plateau. UP does not supercede management authority on any federal, state, or private lands.
The primary UP programs are: Landscape Scale Project Planning, Invasive Species Management, a Native Plant Program, On-The-Ground Treatments, and Education and Technology Transfer. The UP Project directs, coordinates and/or facilitates these activities across jurisdictional boundaries.The UP Project functions in a collaborative approach among the partners, community and interested stakeholders. Public meetings are held throughout the year as a forum for community participation and communication. Field trips, information programs, demonstrations, newsletters, a website, special information sheets and other tools are used for education and outreach.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The Uncompahgre Plateau had long been a favorite hunting ground of Native Americans when the first Spanish explorers came to Southwestern Colorado in the 1760’s. The Ute Indian tribes consisted primarily of highly mobile hunting and gathering groups who had adapted their lifestyles to the seasonal variation and movement of the regional flora and fauna. Over time, they formed attachments to special places for hunting, fishing, gathering, and ceremonial uses. They also developed noticeable, well-established trails from one place to another. The Utes were very dependent on horses, which they adopted in the 1600s. By the 1800s, there were many horses per family. Therefore, grazing of horses would have been an ongoing activity on the Plateau for over a century prior to the arrival of Euro-American settlers. However, impacts to the range would have been limited or localized because of the highly mobile lifestyle of the Utes. The Ute Indians continued to inhabit the Plateau as an ever-increasing number of trappers, explorers and prospectors came to the area. European settlement brought about rapid changes on the Uncompahgre Plateau after the Ute Indians were relocated to Utah by the US government in 1881. Settlers built towns and roads, mined minerals, harvested timber, introduced cattle, diverted and stored water, cleared land and cultivated crops, and built railroads to import and export commodities. Soon after the Utes were forced to leave the Plateau, the cattlemen moved in with their herds. The lands were unmanaged, grazing was uncontrolled, and livestock numbers increased rapidly. On the south end of the Plateau, Placerville became the number one railhead in the world for shipping cattle (Marshall 1981). Grazing was a free-for-all and range disputes were commonplace. According to Marshall (1981), “Competition for grass reached self-destruct excesses when the range was wide open. The herds were enormous”¦ Many of the huge cattle companies were absentee owners… they mined grass the way they mined gold veins – to get it all and get out”. Domestic sheep were introduced to the Plateau early in 1915 and further increased grazing pressure (Smith 1937). A 1944 BLM Range Management Plan for the Escalante Unit of the Uncompahgre Plateau (BLM 1944) provides some perspective on how quickly the Plateau changed after settlement. According to this document, Jefferson Davis Dillard, a cowboy that began working on the Plateau in the 1880’s, “claimed (that initially) the creeks and streams on the mountain (Uncompahgre) were flowing on top of the ground, meandering through the meadow grass, without the deeply defined channels now present. There was no underbrush in those days and a cow was visible for long distances unless hidden by the tall lush grass. He often spoke of how many of the streams had cut deep channels lowering the bed of the stream many feet in the space of 40 years or less and of how the underbrush and aspen had come in so thickly during his lifetime. The Indians made a practice of burning if off in the early days”. As a result of the 1934 Taylor Grazing Act, the federal government regulated grazing on the public domain. This congressional act had a major impact on the West. Cattle numbers on the Plateau fluctuated based on demand and drought but numbers generally remained high well into the 1940’s. As a result of modern grazing management practices initiated by agencies and ranchers, range conditions have significantly improved in most areas during the last 50 years. Extensive logging operations in the 1880’s were the result of demand for lumber in the growing communities around the Plateau. Sawmills were constructed on the Plateau and moved to the timber sources as the need arose. Timber operations occurred along the entire length of the Plateau. Some of the best timber was found on the south end. Marshall (1981) describes the cost of lumber sold by the military at $40 per thousand board feet (in the 1880’s), but in a short time so many sawmills were working on the Plateau that competition and efficiency had brought the cost of lumber to $8 per thousand. Marshall (1981) further describes the impacts of logging. “In those boom construction days when mushrooming towns, mines, and railroads were lumber hungry, many of the mills ran all winter, right through deep snows. The lumber was loaded from the mill onto bobsleds and dragged by horse or oxen down to an altitude where the snow could be coped with better by wheels than runners. There it was loaded onto wagons and hauled the rest of the way to Montrose, Olathe and Delta and by railroad to Ouray, Nucla, Norwood, Grand Junction, and other points east, west, north and south. As lumber companies moved onto the Plateau, roads were hacked in, opening up stands of timber pre-empted by the Stone and Timber Act. Logging roads, contemporaneous with salt roads provided some of the earliest access routes on the mountain”. The Uncompahgre National Forest was established in 1905 to manage natural resources, including planning and regulating timber harvest, grazing, road building and other activities. This was the beginning of active management on the Plateau. Local logging began to greatly diminish in the 1970’s as a result of numerous factors, including outside competition, tighter regulations on waste burning and air quality, reduced availability of timber sales, NEPA appeals, environmental compliance and other factors. Very few new roads have been authorized for construction since the mid 1980’s as a result of the reduction in timber sales by the USFS. Intensive gold and silver mining activity began in the San Juan Mountains just to the south of the Plateau in the 1870=s. With the exception of some placer mining for gold along the San Miguel and Dolores Rivers, very little precious metal mining actually occurred on the Plateau. The Dave Wood Road was built across the Plateau in 1881to haul supplies to the mines and the Plateau became a source of timber, wild game meat, and livestock for the miners. Intensive exploration and mining for uranium and vanadium occurred on the northwest part of the Plateau between the 1930s and 1980s. The effects of this industry (i.e., roads, runways, seismic lines, mines, mills, and tailings) are readily apparent between Nucla and the Unaweep Canyon. Reclamation of prior mining and milling sites is now the primary focus of the uranium/vanadium industry on the Plateau. Early settlers followed many of the trails used by the Ute Indians. It is speculated that many of the existing roads were constructed along these routes. As demand for lumber for mining camps and settlements increased, logging expanded throughout the Plateau resulting in the construction of numerous roads. As cattle and sheep grazing increased, salt trails and roads expanded into more remote locations. Uranium and vanadium exploration and mining resulted in extensive road development in the northwest portion of the Plateau. Hunters and outdoors recreational enthusiasts continue to expand the road and trail system. Unregulated hunting and habitat changes brought about by settlement resulted in the extirpation of elk, wolves and grizzly bears from the Plateau early in the 20th century and deer numbers were greatly reduced. A cowboy reminisced that in the 1920’s “”¦if one of the men saw a deer during the course of a day’s ride that it was worthy of mention that evening to the rest of the men.” (BLM 1944). By the late 1930’s, deer numbers on the Plateau began to noticeably increase, presumably as a result of restricted hunting and habitat changes favorable to deer. Livestock grazing and the absence of fire likely caused forbs and shrubs preferred by deer to replace grass. Agricultural areas in the Uncompahgre Valley and around the Nucla/Norwood areas also benefited deer. By the 1950’s, deer numbers had soared and there was concern deer were becoming too numerous and destroying their habitat. Hunting seasons and bag limits were greatly liberalized in an attempt to control the exploding deer population. Deer numbers probably reached their peak in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s. By 1970, deer had declined to the point that hunting was restricted to bucks only and management was directed once again towards trying to increase deer numbers. The deer population rebounded in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s only to go into a steady decline in the 1990’s despite the elimination of doe harvests. Elk were reintroduced to the Plateau in 1923 with a release of 18 animals west of Montrose. Over the next 34 years, elk numbers slowly increased resulting in the first legal hunting season on the Plateau being held in 1957. Elk numbers began to increase very rapidly during the 1970’s and 1980’s reaching an estimated post-hunt population of approximately 9,000 in 1990. Over the last decade, greatly increased cow elk harvest has maintained the elk population at approximately 9,000. Between the 1930’s and the early 1970’s, extensive habitat treatments occurred on the Plateau primarily to benefit livestock. These treatments included contouring, plowing, chaining of pinyon-juniper, herbicide spraying of sagebrush and Gambel oak, burning, and water developments. Most treatments were not re-seeded or were re-seeded with non-native species such as crested or intermediate wheatgrass. These treatments reached their peak between 1956 and 1965. According to Kufeld (1979), “”¦during the 1956-65 period when deer populations were very high and the heaviest harvests were achieved in an effort to reduce deer herds in an overpopulated range, vast acreages of deer range were being sprayed (27,112 acres) and chained (4,699) on the north half (of what is currently Game Management Unit 62), with perhaps detrimental effects to deer habitat, while large areas (8,642 acres) were being modified to improve conditions for deer on the south half through pinyon-juniper chaining. Prior to European settlement, Native Americans frequently used fire to improve hunting conditions and remove undergrowth to facilitate movement. In a last act of defiance, the Utes set large fires on the Plateau before they were forced to leave in 1881 (Marshall 1981). After settlement, fires were suppressed to protect timber and property. Throughout most of their existence, the USFS and the BLM have had policies to actively suppress natural fires on public lands. In the past 120 years the Plateau has been grazed, fenced, logged, sprayed, plowed, contoured, chained, seeded, mined, quarried, laced with an extensive network of roads, subdivided and developed, used for a wide variety of recreational activities, crossed by electrical transmission and pipe lines, invaded by exotic plants and altered by water diversions and developments. Some of these activities have been benign, some have been beneficial, and others have had negative effects on the overall health and sustainability of the natural systems of the Plateau ecosystem. The boundaries of the Uncompahgre Plateau contain an amazing diversity of landscapes. Broadly speaking, these landscapes can be divided into three main life zones: the Plains Zone, the Foothills Zone, and the Montane Zone. Each zone generally corresponds to a range of altitude, with the Plains Zone at the lowest elevations and the Montane Zone at the highest. These life zones are rough estimates of the altitudinal coverage of the major and easily recognizable plant communities. There are not sharp delineations between each zone, but a gradual transition from one to the next. Depending on the aspect (i.e. north or south facing), species that are commonly associated with a particular altitude may be found well into lower or higher altitude zones. For example, on wetter, colder north faces, plants common in the Montane Zone may extend well down into the lower Foothill Zone. On south slopes, which dry out much quicker due to more intense solar radiation, species common in the Foothill Zone may extend well up into the Montane Zone. The Plains Zone generally lies at elevations between 4500-6000 feet. Some botanists refer to this area as the Desert-steppe zone as well. It includes the riparian corridors along the major rivers and their tributaries, as well as the treeless, arid to semi-arid river bench country of the lower river basins. The low elevation land immediately adjacent to and including the riparian zones of the Uncompahgre, Gunnison, Dolores, San Miguel, and Colorado Rivers and their tributaries comprise the bulk of this zone. The riparian corridors are typically cottonwood-dominated woodlands. Three species of cottonwoods occur – the Narrowleaf Cottonwood (Populus angustifolia), with linear-lanceolate shaped leaves, is found at the higher elevation reaches of the riparian drainages; the Rio Grande Cottonwood (Populus deltoids), with broader, triangular-shaped leaves, occurs along the lower reaches of the streams and rivers; and the Lance-leaf Cottonwood (Populus x acuminate), which is a hybrid possessing mixed characteristics of the above two species, has lanceolate-shaped leaves, and occurs where the ranges of the Narrowleaf and Rio Grande Cottonwoods overlap. On the benches and plains adjacent to the river corridors, native vegetation consists primarily of shrub communities dominated by sumac, greasewood, shadscale, rabbitbrush, and winter fat, with sparse coverage of grasses such as galleta and blue grama. In springs following winters of abundant precipitation, this zone can also support beautiful arrays of ephemeral spring annuals.
The Foothills Zone includes most of the landscape between 6000 and 8000 feet, and is dominated by pinyon and juniper trees. This zone provides good winter shelter for mule deer, but due to the scarce understory, is lacking in valuable browse and forage plants. Where present, grasses which do occur in this zone include galleta, Indian ricegrass, blue grama, sideoats grama, western wheatgrass, and crested wheatgrass and annual cheatgrass, or downy brome, both introduced from Asia. Near the upper end of this zone, and transitioning into the montane zone, Ponderosa pine, blue spruce, scattered aspens, and Gambel oak form open brushy woodlands. Dense thickets of Gambel oak and areas dominated by big sagebrush also begin to occur, and the grass community becomes dominated by western wheatgrass. A little higher still, the transition into the Montane Zone continues. Mountain mahogany, serviceberry, and snowberry begin to add to the shrub community, which still supports sagebrush, Gambel oak, and scattered Ponderosa and aspen stands. Various needlegrasses and fescues now start to add to the lower-growing grass and herb layer. At about 9000 feet, the Ponderosa pine begins to mix with much more widespread stands of aspen. The aspen stands generally have well-developed understories containing a diversity of cool season grasses, elk sedge, aspen peavine, and meadowrue. At the top of Montane Zone, closed forests of Engleman Spruce and subalpine fir tend to dominate, with interspersed parks scattered throughout. These parks are valuable summer and fall habitat for the abundant elk herds on the plateau, and are dominated by native wheatgrasses, fescues, needle grasses, alpine timothy, June grass, and native and introduced brome grasses and bluegrasses. They also harbor a great diversity of broadleaved forbs, including Barberii larkspur, lupines, vetches, wild geranium, yarrow, goosefoot, pussy toes, sulphur buckwheat, penstemons, cinquefoils, and daisies. The overarching goal of the UP Project is to improve the ecosystem health and natural functions of the Uncompahgre Plateau. Specific goals include: 1) Increase the species and age diversity and quality/productivity of native plant and animal communities. 2) Change the distribution of plant age classes to match a more natural distribution. 3) Improve watershed health, water quality and yield. 4) Improve habitat quality for most wildlife species. 5) Increase the recruitment and natural survival of mule deer. 6) Improve the distribution and quality of the mule deer winter range. 7) Prevent the reproduction and spread of noxious weeds on the Plateau. 8) Develop community partnerships to promote the health of the Plateau while sustaining social and cultural values. 9) Provide new stewardship opportunities for sustaining community-based natural resource businesses. 10) Demonstrate a collaborative partnership between communities and agencies working together in an adaptive approach to ecosystem management tailored to restoration efforts across jurisdictional boundaries.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The UP Project was originally formalized in a 2001 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)/Cooperative Agreement (CA) with an expiration date of December 31, 2006. On November 1, 2006, a new MOU/CA was signed by the partners, replacing the original following its expiration. The MOU/CA was developed for the purpose of clarifying the intent of partners to coordinate on the restoration and sustainability of the ecological, social, cultural and economic values of the Uncompahgre Plateau. Partners in the project include: U.S. Forest Service – Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison (GMUG) National Forest. There are three USFS Ranger Districts represented on the Plateau: Ouray, Norwood, and Grand Valley. Bureau of Land Management – Grand Junction and Uncompahgre Field Offices. Colorado Division of Wildlife – SW Region, Montrose Area Office (18). Each agency manages land within their jurisdiction for their respective goals. Agencies take into account a complex array of rules, regulations and jurisdictional authorities prior to implementing projects. Most of the Plateau’s public lands are currently being managed for multiple-use. Prescriptions for grazing, logging, fuel-wood cutting, wildlife habitat, recreation, mining, transportation, watershed protection and reducing fuel loads are the primary management practices occurring on the Plateau. Private lands are primarily managed for farming, ranching, recreation, summer homes and development. Additionally, other notable project partners include Public Lands Partnership, Western Area Power Administration, and Tri-State Generation.
The UP project has a formalized structure to facilitate decision-making. That formal structure consists of the following: Executive Committee–The Executive Committee is comprised of the managers of: the Colorado Division of Wildlife (SW Region, Area 19); the Forest Service (the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests [GMUG]); the Uncompahgre and Grand Junction Field Offices of the Colorado BLM; Western Area Power Administration, an agency of the Department of Energy; Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc., an electric cooperative; and the Public Lands Partnership. The Executive Committee is responsible for final approval of the UP Plan and for annually reviewing project progress and addressing future resource commitments by each partner.
Technical Committee–The Technical Committee is the working group and backbone of the UP Partnership. Each Partner (BLM, USFS, PLP, CDOW, WAPA and Tri-State) has one or two representatives on the Technical Committee. Their role is to promote collaboration and interagency/community cooperation to achieve the goals of UP. The Technical Committee meets monthly to handle coordination of activities, meet with outside members, review project requests, and recommend budgeting and project approvals. Each committee member is a liaison for their organization and takes information back to their organization for review and approval. The members of the Technical Committee bring potential opportunities for collaboration to the table; discuss areas where the Partners can coordinate efforts; and test the ecological, social and economic soundness of specific actions and proposals to be carried out under UP. Once a decision is agreed upon by all parties, it is implemented and progress monitored. Public Partnerships–The UP Public Partnerships are constituted by members of all UP Partners, members of the broader public, and interest groups at large. Public Partnerships are called upon by UP when formal public input is needed regarding any specific action. The UP Project is continually seeking feedback from the public on what is it that we want for the Plateau, what are the things we value about it; what do we want to see protected, enhanced or managed for specific landscape, economic and social purposes.

Description of Project Activities: Dry Creek/Spring Creek
In 2003, the UP Mosaic Group, comprised by specialists from the BLM, USFS, CDOW, PLP, Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), Tri-State and other organizations worked together to complete the Dry Creek/Spring Creek Vegetation Management Strategy, a coordinated, interagency plan to guide land management at a watershed scale. Spring Creek and Dry Creek had been identified as priority watersheds by the UP Watershed Prioritization team, based on ecological needs and social and economic criteria. Based on this plan, in the spring of 2004, UP implemented a variety of on-the-ground restoration and vegetation management treatments in the Dry Creek/Spring Creek watersheds on the Uncompahgre Plateau.  These combined treatments, which totaled roughly 4,966 acres, were designed to enhance the fire survivability of the power lines and aesthetic impact of the utility corridor, accomplish wildlife habitat goals and improve overall land health. Tools included hydro-ax, roller chop, prescribed fire and cheatgrass spray. Planning and implementation of on-the- ground projects were done collaboratively, with multiple interests being embraced, funds leveraged and shared, and tasks efficiently coordinated. 

Description of Projects:
Sims Mesa Area
*CDOW treated BLM land
*Tools: Combination of hydro-ax and roller chopper. 
*Driver (primary goal):To improve Gunnison sage-grouse and mule deer habitat by reducing pinyon pine and juniper encroachment into the sagebrush parks, increasing the amount and diversity of shrubs, and restoring a native grass/forb understory in the sagebrush stands.

Government Springs Area
*Roller chopped on old chainings done in the 1960's. The CDOW completed more treatments in the general vicinity of the power lines.  *Tool: Hydro-ax  *Driver: The goal of these treatments was to improve mule deer habitat by reducing the pinyon-pine-juniper canopy enough to allow establishment of additional grasses and forbs and reinvigorate the existing mountain shrub community.  The CDOW treatments were in previously untreated stands of mixed pinyon pine-juniper, sagebrush, and oakbrush shrubs.

*In addition, prescribed burns took place and are ongoing near the power lines in areas that were roller chopped in 2001 and BLM land. *Tool: Roller chopper with scheduled prescribed fire. *Driver/goal: To reduce the fire hazard along the powerline and to improve the aesthetic impact of the corridor.

*Work on private lands (HPP funds) was done within an old chaining where the young pinyon pine and juniper trees were becoming dense, and the shrub component old and decadent. *Tool: Hydro-ax
*Driver/goal: to improve deer habitat and protect wildland urban interface (W.U.I.). 

*To accomplish the restoration and vegetation management efforts on BLM land along the power lines in the Government Springs area, Tri-State covered the cost of the cultural clearance for treatments along the right-of- way, Western Area Power Administration supplied four lineman for a week to help flag in the treatment units, and BLM supplied funding for the roller chop work. The CDOW covered the cost of all their habitat treatments on both BLM and private lands.

Ironhorse Analysis Area
The Ironhorse Analysis Area (IAA) is a 65,000 acre landscape of ponderosa pine, pine-oak, aspen, pinyon-juniper woodland, and sagebrush rangeland located at the southern tip of the Uncompahgre Plateau approximately six miles east of Norwood, Colorado.  The IAA was extensively modified during the settlement and homesteading era of the late 19th century and received heavy commercial use well into the middle of the 20th century before being acquired by the National Forest System.

The fundamental changes in the forest and rangeland plant communities associated with this land use history resulted in the current legacy of vegetative conditions on the Ironhorse landscape. The primary effects of this land use were related to roads, homesteading, dryland agriculture, extensive livestock grazing, exploitive timber harvest and fire exclusion.  While this situation describes the general condition and land use history of many low elevation ponderosa pine and dry forest types in the western United States, the extent of the impacts on the Ironhorse landscape are of a scope and scale that represents the more highly altered end of the disturbance scale. Vegetation structure, age, condition and spatial patterns within the IAA appear to be inconsistent with the estimated historic range of variability (Romme et al). This is in part due to the fact that many of the land use practices persisted on this landscape long past being discontinued on other areas primarily because of the easy access to its grazing and valuable ponderosa pine resource. 

The ponderosa pine community in the IAA both defines and makes it a fairly unique resource on the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forest (GMUG).  Ponderosa pine communities represent a relatively small component (3.5 %) of the forested type on the nearly three million-acre GMUG NF.  In comparison, ponderosa pine makes up 42.8% of the forested type within the IAA.  The IAA contains 24% of the total ponderosa pine for the entire GMUG Forest.  Ponderosa pine provides important habitat diversity for several of the forest management indicator species (MIS) and is highly desired for big game and livestock grazing, recreation, timber and aesthetic values.   Therefore, the ponderosa pine communities within the IAA are an integral resource for the entire GMUG NF.

A majority of the Ironhorse landscape (>50%) was in private ownership through the 1950s. The subsequent acquisition of the private lands into the National Forest System lead to some of the first efforts in large scale vegetation restoration on the GMUG NF.  These restoration efforts were perhaps simplistic by contemporary standards, but did represent a successful operational effort to restore forest and rangeland cover through reforestation and rangeland seeding. There are, however, some unintended consequences related to the previous land uses and successional trajectories associated with past and current management direction, which suggest a need for timely management intervention.

In addition to the legacy of past land use, the previous landowners and the GMUG NF have, for the most part, successfully implemented a fire suppression program that has resulted in fire exclusion in a landscape that was adapted to a relatively frequent, low intensity fire regime. It is estimated that 78% of the Uncompahgre Plateau is moderately to significantly altered from its characteristic fire regime (Romme).  The cumulative vegetative and fuel conditions resulting from this collective history are the underlying challenge for current and future management of the IAA. 

Findings suggest a need to intervene or explore opportunities to move the landscape in the direction of pre-settlement (1870) structural and spatial restoration in the pine ecosystem.  The application of a combination of active and passive restoration approaches are recommended to restore ecosystem function and resiliency, reduce the potential for unnaturally severe wildfires, and reduce susceptibility to abnormal levels of insect and disease mortality to this unique area.  Current landscape conditions are predisposed for uncharacteristic disturbances that could disrupt societal expectations from this landscape.

Native Plant Program
It was an excellent year for seed production  - both in the wild and in our increase and research fields.  Kelly Memmott, UP Native Plant Program Coordinator, and his crew have been busy irrigating, weeding and harvesting sizeable amounts of seed from our fields at numerous locations in Utah and Colorado. To help with the workload, the UP purchased a tractor in April using BLM funds.

The UP crew continues to collect data on our Cultivation, Life History and Species Adaptability study plots. They will spend the winter cleaning seed and compiling data from our numerous research studies. As we learn more about the different species within our program, we are able to focus our efforts on those that are most promising and demonstrate valuable characteristics such as drought tolerance, high germination rates, and ease of cultivation. Currently, we are working with 47 native species, of which 27 species are in the Seed Increase program and 34 are in cultural and/or life history studies. 
UP has 1 shrub, 4 grasses and 9 forbs that are ready to go to commercial growers within the next year (2007-2008). Plant Species Ready for Commercial Release:

The UP Team is working closely with the Utah Crop Improvement Association in evaluating the various methods in which to release this native seed stalk. 

Species Adaptability Studies
In Spring 2006, Species Adaptability Studies were initiated for 13 grass species at four locations in UT and CO. The studies compare 113 assesstions of these species - looking specifically at survivability, seed production and vigor of local populations compared to cultivars that are available on the commercial market. In Summer 2007, the sites were evaluated and seed collected.

WIldland Native Seed Mix Trials
This fall, UP planted a suite of our native species in two wildland settings near Fountain Green, UT - one natural wildland setting and one area that experienced a wildfire in the summer of 2007. These plantings will provide excellent public demonstration sites as well as provide useful data on the survivability of these local ecotypes when planted in a seed mix.

Rogers Mesa
Dr. Ron Godin, Research Scientist at Rogers Mesa and CSU Professor, has also been engaged in research studies including Life History, Irrigation Scheduling, and Spacing on a large number of our native plants.  He stated that this year's seed crop is excellent and his team found innovative ways to harvest it including using a conventional lawn mower and a leaf blower.  Using funds from a WSARE grant, Dr. Godin is also working with six local farmers who are interested in growing native plants.

Seed Collection
UP has been collecting seed from some of our most promising native plant species for further tests.  Dr. Allan Stevens, Snow College, collected seed in western Utah and Tony Hoag, a local biologist, collected seed from 8 key grass species from multiple sites on the Uncompahgre Plateau.  Using these collections, UP will expand their Species Adaptability Studies in order to better understand the local populations of the upper Colorado Plateau. Several study sites will be set up in western Utah on both USFS and BLM lands. Mountain and Wyoming big sagebrush seed was wildland collected on the Uncompahgre Plateau and seed was harvested from our cliffrose seed increase plots at Billy Creek, CO in November.

Planting Fourwing Saltbush at the Nature Conservancy Fields
In November, the UP planted 30 acres of irrigated fields owned by the Nature Conservancy along the San Miguel River with wildland-collected fourwing saltbush. These fields will provide an excellent opportunity for seed production as well as a study of cultural practices and harvesting techniques of this important, low-elevation shrub. In 2008, UP plans to plant native grasses between the rows for seed production and to prevent invasive species infestation.

Study of Seed Production of Mountain Big Sagebrush
In the summer of 2006, two research study sites (one site on BLM and one site on USFS) were established on the Uncompahgre Plateau to examine the effect of reducing competition on seed production and shrub vigor of mountain big sagebrush. In November, the transects were monitored.

Expansion of our Current Program
In June, representatives from the US Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, State Wildlife Agencies, Northern Arizona University and the Uncompahgre Plateau (UP) Project met in Moab, UT to discuss the formation of the Colorado Plateau Native Plant Initiative (CPNPI); an interagency, multi-state, native plant materials program.
Recent major wildfires and declining wildlife populations highlight the need to enhance, recover and/or restore ecosystems within the Colorado Plateau.  A stable and significant supply of native seed is needed to facilitate the restoration and rehabilitation of native plant communities within these wildland burned areas, fuels reduction treatment areas, depleted rangeland, wildlife habitat, energy development areas and for noxious weed prevention and treatment.

As UP has learned, the development and production of native plants is a substantial and long-term commitment that requires a coordinated, regional effort.  The CPNPI partners will benefit from a comprehensive interagency program that pools resources and maximizes efficiency.  The program will build upon the established UP Native Plant Program and will continue to learn from the Great Basin Native Plant Selection and Increase Project. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: A principal objective of the Uncompahgre Program has been to advance the science of plant community restoration. Re-establishment or improvement of native plant communities requires not only the availability of site adapted species and ecotypes, but includes the technology to change the species composition on large and diverse sites. Implementation of large-scale restoration projects requires the availability and use of considerable equipment and technical support. Land managers and agency personnel must be advised of the practices that can be satisfactory adopted and utilized.  Many land managers and agency personnel have not dealt with the use of specific native species and have relied heavily upon planting introduced species as substitutes for restoration. Stabilization and recovery of many wildlife habitats have not been achieved through planting of introduced species, yet the acceptance and use of native species has languished as planting stock and planting practices have slowly evolved. A major part of the current program is to furnish information to working groups and agency personnel that are planning and developing restoration projects. Information concerning the availability and usefulness of native species being developed by the UP Project continues to be assembled and provided to land managers. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Farming & Ranching
Farming and ranching are important industries on private land in the UP Project area. Farming primarily occurs in and around the Uncompahgre Valley with corn, pinto beans, alfalfa and grass hay, and onions among the major crops. Cattle and/or sheep grazing occurs over most of the Plateau on federal, state and private lands. Grazing allotments on BLM and USFS lands are tied to privately owned base properties in the UP Project area.  Currently, sheep allotments only occur on the eastern part of the Plateau, south of Escalante Canyon. Regulated grazing on National Forest lands generally occurs in the period between June and October whereas regulated grazing on BLM lands primarily occurs in the period between October and June. Water rights to divert and store water for irrigation and livestock are an important part of the farming and ranching industry.

Logging
Commercial logging has occurred on the Plateau for 100 years. Reduced timber sales by the USFS have significantly decreased timber harvest on the Plateau. Small sales of saw logs and firewood are the current logging operations. Federal agencies also issue personal use permits for post cutting, Christmas trees and firewood.

Recreation
Recreational use of the Plateau has steadily increased. Sightseeing, hunting, fishing, off-highway motorized vehicle use, snowmobiling, mountain biking, river running, camping, hiking, four-wheeling and cross-country skiing are among the many recreational activities. Hunting is a major recreation use on the Plateau. The Division of Wildlife has divided the UP area into two Game Management Units, GMUs 61 and 62. GMU 61, the west side of the Plateau, has been managed as a quality elk unit since 1983 and as a quality deer unit since 1992. All GMU 61 licenses are limited and antlered licenses can take several years to draw. GMU 62, the east side of the Plateau, has historically been one of the most heavily hunted units in the state for deer and elk. It has been managed as an over-the-counter license unit for elk.

Development
The Uncompahgre area attracts many people because of its great scenic beauty, outdoor opportunities, and quality of life. Areas of rapid development on the Plateau include the Uncompahgre Valley, Ridgway/Loghill Mesa, Government Springs, Dave Wood Road, the Norwood area, the San Miguel Canyon, and the Iron Springs Mesa area. Land values and housing development have increased considerably on the south end of the Plateau due to proximity to Ridgway and Telluride.  There are several major subdivisions currently being constructed as in-holdings within the BLM and U.S. Forest Service lands.  Two examples include the Hideout Ranch and Cornerstone subdivisions totaling over 500 homes and each with an 18-hole golfcourse. 

Roads
The Plateau has a high density of roads.  Many roads follow trails used by Native Americans who took advantage of natural topographic features to facilitate travel. The Divide Road is the primary road on the Plateau, running northwest and southeast from one end of the Plateau to the other. Major roads connecting with the Divide Road include Dave Wood Road, Highway 90, the Transfer Road, and 25 Mesa Road. In addition to the major roads, an extensive network of minor roads have been created by agencies, counties, hunters, loggers, ranchers, miners, motorized recreationists, and others. Roads and traffic are a major impact on the resources on the Plateau.

Mining and Energy
Very little mining activity currently occurs on the Plateau. Much of the mining activity is related to reclaiming uranium and vanadium mines and mills on the northwestern portion of the Plateau. An open pit coal mine is still in operation near Nucla. Gravel and borrow mining is prevalent throughout the area and is primarily located close to development and towns. Federal land management agencies issue permits for commercial and private rock gathering.
Several electrical and natural gas transmission lines, sub-stations and pumping facilities are located on the Plateau. Opportunities exist to enhance the maintenance, reconstruction and enhancement of transmission right-of-ways. Logical efforts include maintenance to enhance reliability and security. Opportunities for enhancing scenery management objectives include feathering the vegetation along the right-of-way for improved visual quality.
With an increase in Oil and Gas exploration in the western United States, it is expected that the Uncompahgre Plateau will begin to see wells.  The USFS and BLM are currently reviewing lease applications from several major Oil and Gas companies.  This type of activity on the Plateau calls for careful planning and the restoration of native plant and animal communities during and after drilling occurs.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The Uncompahgre Project is a unique example of a broad collaborative approach to landscape-scale restoration projects.  By facilitating a transparent process, the UP has involved all interested parties in the discussion of landscape health and the processes attendant to ecological restoration in the region.  Overall ecosystem health in this region is tied to the livelihoods of many people with a large number of people still tied to the land through agriculture and ranching, and the UP supports the continuing improvement of ecological conditions to support the local economies.  By acting as a clearinghouse for the ecological information and research being conducted on the various elements of the project, the UP has facilitated the dissemination of appropriate information to land-owners, agencies, and interested individuals through their publications, website, and workshops.
The Uncompahgre Project is an example of well-funded, effective collaboration at a bioregional level. The development of current efforts such as the Colorado Plateau Native Plant Initiative place the UP as an effective leader in its region in terms of ecological restoration science and collaborative planning and facilitation. The UP illustrates that collaborative processes allow for the numerous interests found in the Western United States to be sorted out in an effective way to promote regional restoration solutions. The scope of the UP being landscape in scale promotes the project as an almost permanent institution for future work, research, and funding. The number of studies being conducted, the variety of efforts, and the nature of the collaborative process all provide for an integrated approach to constant updating of management strategies and efforts. Additionally, involving the interests of researchers from academia, the interests of the various agencies, and all land-owners in a constant process of evaluation allows for the project to have a long-term resilience and the ability to direct funding appropriately.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-california-ah-pah-creek-watershed-restoration/	USA: California: Ah Pah Creek Watershed Restoration	United States of America	1992-01-01	2001-01-01	"Ah Pah Creek is a fourth order stream with a 16.3 square mile watershed composed entirely of steep, forested land. Virtually all of the drainage is owned by the Simpson Timber Company and is managed for commercial timber production. There are three major tributaries to the main stem: the North Fork, the South Fork and Moon Creek. The main stem upstream of the South Fork confluence is often referred to as the “Middle Fork”, but is identified as the main stem. The majority of the reaches in these tributaries are moderately steep and confined. The main stem enters a wider alluvial valley downstream of the South Fork confluence and its lower reaches, as well as the lower reach of each of the tributaries, are less confined and lower gradient. The main stem and South Fork Ah Pah Creek, as well as Moon Creek, support populations of coho salmon, steelhead, and coastal cutthroat trout. The North Fork supports populations of steelhead and coastal cutthroat trout, with coho only being sporadically observed in recent Yoruk Tribal Fisheries Program (YTFP) surveys. Chinook salmon have been observed sporadically in the lower portion of drainage over the last 20 years but are not routinely found in Ah Pah or its tributaries.Extensive logging road networks were constructed and intensive logging occurred
throughout the Ah Pah watershed between the late 1940’s and mid-1960’s and these activities had widespread impacts on aquatic and riparian habitat throughout the drainage. In addition, the Highway 101 Redwood Park Bypass was constructed across the headwaters of the Ah Pah Creek drainage in the late 1980’s and had substantial additional deleterious effects on streambed sedimentation levels and habitat quality throughout the basin. Yoruk Tribal Watershed Restoration Program (YTWRP) conducted a road network inventory throughout the Ah Pah drainage in winter 1997-1998 and has since decommissioned several miles of high treatment priority roads in each of the tributaries. YTFP and the California Conservation Corps (CCC) have collaborated efforts to address riparian restoration needs within the drainage, including extensive riparian conifer planting in each of tributaries. In addition, the CCC have constructed numerous instream habitat structures within the main stem and South Fork in an attempt to improve habitat quality and complexity and fish passage in these drainages.Deforestation, Fragmentation, Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The arrival of 49ers with the Gold Rush were the first in a long history increasing sedimentation in the watersheds of the lower Klamath River. Widespread timber harvest of the redwoods resulted in over a hundred fifty miles of roads being constructed in the upper Ah Pah watershed by the US Forest Service and Simpson Timber Company. These intensive land use practices, interstate road construction flood events, and stream clearance projects left Ah Pah Creek with little instream fish habitat. The Klamath river is well known for its salmon fisheries and much of the Northern California and Southern Oregon fishing industry depended upon the Klamath as a major source of salmon for their economic well-being. However, the increased sedimentation in the watershed due to first mining and later timber harvest, as well as upstream damming projects for hydroelectric power and irrigation led to a drastic decline in the salmon populations in the entire river basin. Changes in channel morphology throughout the system due to changing hydrological conditions associated with timber operations, changing temperature of the water because of upstream dams, widespread increased sedimentation, and the lack of spawning habitat all contributed to the decline of the river’s fishery. Ah Pah Creek is a small tributary of the Klamath River in Northern California. The Klamath River was once one of the most productive salmon fisheries in the western United States. Historically, these forests were dominated by Coast Redwoods which were distributed among a wide variety of communities, including Douglas fir-tan oak forests, oak woodlands, closed-cone pine forests, bogs, and coastal grasslands. Most of the redwood-dominated forests are in the valley bottoms, where there is abundant fog and periodic floods every 30 to 60 years. The environment here is moist because of Pacific storms in the winter and coastal fogs in the summer. Some ecologists suspect that without periodic disturbances such as fire and floods, ancient redwood groves may eventually be replaced by western hemlock. The Yurok are known to have altered these ecosystems extensively with gathering and by using fire to cultivate specific basketry materials, improving elk habitat, fuel control, and for maintaining health in various forest types. In 1986, Congress passed the Klamath River Basin Act noting that “floods, the construction and operation of dams, diversions and hydroelectric projects, past mining, timber harvest practices, and road-building have all contributed to sedimentation, reduced flows, and degraded water quality which have significantly reduced the anadromous fish habitat in the Klamath River system.” The act authorized a 20 year Federal-Sate cooperative Klamath River Basin Area Restoration program to restore the Klamath River Basin fish stocks. Out of this grew training programs in 1999 run by the Yurok tribe for Watershed Restoration Training and Implementation Program. The goal of the multi-year restoration effort was to remediate man-caused sediment sources from 30 tributary sub-basins within the Lower Klamath River Basin, Ah Pah Creek being one of these. The program grew out of long-term restoration goals of the Yurok Tribe: 1) to restore the Klamath River fisheries to their healthiest possible condition and create job training and employment opportunities for Tribal members.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Yurok tribe initiated the large-scale, coordinated watershed restoration effort throughout the Lower Klamath sub-basin in conjunction with the Simpson Timber Compay and the California Coastal Conservancy. The Ah Pah Creek restoration is significant because it involves work done partially on Yurok tribal lands by Yurok restorationists, as well as on lands owned by the Simpson Timber Company. It is a broader collaborative endeavor that includes the Yurok tribe, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the California Department of Fish and Game, the California Conservation Corps, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, United States Forest Service, and the United States Department of the Interior. It also involves the Simpson Timber Company as both land owner and funder for the various projects. The Yurok tribe owns the land along the river and depends heavily upon the existence of salmon for their livelihood and the continuation of their cultural traditions.

Description of Project Activities: Road Decomissioning:
Project activities included road abandonment, decommissioning, and obliteration (decommissioning);  or road drainage improvements, stormproofing, landslide treatments and culvert/stream crossing upgrades (upgrades)  for 15 miles of road.  Road conditions were initially assessed by examining road inventory maps provided by the landowner and by on-the-ground site visits by the cooperator and USFWS. Sites were prioritized through these assessments to determine the most cost effective use of grant funds. Roads were decommissioned, storm proofed or upgraded using excavators, bulldozers, dump trucks, graders and loaders, according to site specific conditions and future use needs. Culvert replacement, bioengineered stabilization structures, riparian restoration, culvert trash rack construction, mulching and planting were noted to also require considerable hand labor. Upgrading and storm proofing roads involved excavating unstable sidecast and uncompacted fill to a more stable location, installing new and appropriately sized culverts, installation of rolling dips to allow use of the road, while diverting runoff from the road surface, and regrading the road prism to disconnect the road and ditch from stream channel functions. Road decommissioning involved ripping compacted surfaces, excavating unstable fill and fill near stream crossings, removal of unmaintained culverts and ""Humboldt"" crossings and outsloping the terrain to mimic natural topography. Several stream crossings and log landing sites along the road were also treated.  Unstable fills and log landings with the potential to add sediment to the stream or which are already failing will be addressed as well as stream crossings that divert  water and those that have the potential to do so.  The treatments involved complete removal of all original soil used to create stream crossings including metal or plastic culverts and stream crossings constructed of wood.  Excavation of crossings will occur down to the natural stream channel and slope as much as possible.  Unstable soil perched along the outer edges of the road and log landings was pulled back and placed to create a natural slope, and at some sites the soil were removed and placed in a geologically stable location. 5 barrier modifications were performed, 28 log structures were installed, and 1 Hewitt ramp was maintained in the riparian corridor. Construction of 20 stream bank stabilization and large woody debris structures, complete shaping and rehabilitation of seven acres of flood plain, terracing and revegetation of the riparian corridor. These actions are intended to decrease sedimentation, increase riparian cover and improve salmonid migrations. 

Tree Planting:
All riparian planting was conducted using standard planting techniques such as those discussed in Flosi and Reynolds (1994).  Crews planted the provided bare-root conifers (average size 1-2 feet tall) using a hoedad, with care taken to properly bury the root system to prevent ""J-rooting"" and properly stabilize the trees.  Most effects of poorly planted trees typically show signs within the first few years. Redwood and Douglas fir trees were planted evenly in areas that were considered to support both species of trees.  Habitat areas that received direct sunlight and/or hotter summertime temperatures were planted with a higher concentration of Douglas fir trees, while areas that had a denser overstory were planted with higher concentrations of redwood trees.  All trees were stored in a refrigerated cold storage facility that provided optimal conditions before planting occurred (provided by Simpson Resource Company). Tree planting crews consisted of 2-4 members, each of which carried approximately 200-300 trees each in planting bags. In extremely remote areas extra trees were packed into the designated planting area to cut down on transport time.  Trees were planted at a spacing of approximately 8-10 feet, with favorable microsite when planting trees (such as shaded locations behind logs or stumps).  Ideal planting spots are found where the soil is deep, well drained, and free of large obstructions.  Crews would typically start planting at the most distant location and work their way back out, thus avoiding the possibility of stepping on previously planted trees.

Alder Thinning:
YTFP inventoried each tree thinning reach to enumerate conifers that had not yet succeeded above the dense alder canopy. YTFP crews marked each of the identified trees that was at least 10 feet from and no more then 100 feet from the creek with survey flagging and a sequentially numbered metal tree tag.  Crews then fell the minimum number of alder trees around each conifer necessary to adequately open the tree canopy for increased sunlight penetration and unobstructed canopy succession.  Every fifth tagged conifer (20% of total) was left as is, with no alteration of the alder overstory.  For every tagged conifer, the following information was recorded: species, height, diameter (at dbh), distance from creek, location along creek, number of alders felled around tree (if any), and tag number.  This collected data, along with the 20% in which no alteration occurred, allows for long term monitoring of the effectiveness of this approach to encouraging reestablishment of a conifer-dominated canopy.  YTFP will be revisiting each reach on a five-year interval to recollect this data.  This will allow an assessment of change in tree size for both the trees where the alders were thinned and for those in which 
no alteration of the canopy occurred. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: In order to address chronic sedimentation with both drainages, YTFP conducted road network and sedimentation delivery assessments in Ah Pah Creek during winter 1997-1998. This inventories assessed all road and skid-trail networks within the drainage and prioritized each potential failure (slope failure) site based on potential quantity of delivered sediment and treatment urgency.  In response to these assessments, YTFP conducted road decommissioning and upgrade on high priority sites within the basin during summer 1998-2000.  By 2002, approximately 20 miles of high priority roads in Ah Pah, McGarvey and Tectah (adjacent watersheds) Creeks have been decommissioned by YTFP, as well as treating numerous landings and removal several defunct log bridges.  Of these 20 miles of decommissioned roads, â‰ˆ5 miles within McGarvey Creek, â‰ˆ5 miles within Ah Pah Creek, and â‰ˆ2 within Tectah Creek were located directly along the streams and their major tributaries.   Simpson Resource Company (Simpson), the principal landowner in all three drainages, donated 10,000 bareroot coastal redwood and Douglas fir trees (â‰ˆ12-24"" in height) to YTFP during 2002 to revegetate these decommissioned riparian road segments.  YTFP planted these trees during winter 2002 on approximately eight of the twelve miles of riparian decommissioned roads. A total of 10,000 bareroot redwood and Douglas fir trees were planted along recently decommissioned roads within the riparian corridor of McGarvey, Ah Pah, and Tectah creeks. These recently outsloped and ripped roads provided an excellent opportunity to reestablish redwood and Douglas fir adjacent to these streams before competing alder and berry species (Rubus sp.) could get established.  Normally the undergrowth is too extensive to allow for successful tree planting in these areas, while the dense alder overstory results in excessively slow growth rates for the planted trees.  The decommissioned roadways are currently clear of vegetation, however, as well as providing a corridor of increased canopy opening.  Redwood and Douglas fir trees were planted in particular habitat regions based on riparian canopy cover and average climate. A decommissioned road network in upper South Fork Ah Pah was planted with approximately 2,000 trees, consisting of 50 % redwood and 50% Douglas fir trees.

Twenty clusters of conifers were thinned in upper mainstem Ah Pah Creek.  A total 50 redwood and 7 Douglas fir trees were released in this reach.  Douglas fir trees ranged from 1.6-10.2 inches in diameter, with an average of 4.7 inches, while the diameter of redwood trees ranged from 1.3-22.9 inches, with an average diameter of 6.6 inches.  Douglas fir tree ranged from 10-60 feet in height with an average height of 26 feet, while redwood trees ranged in height from 7-50 feet, with an average of 28 feet.  A total of 92 alders were thinned from both redwood and Douglas fir trees along the South Fork Ah Pah Creek. Nineteen clusters of conifers were thinned in South Fork Ah Pah Creek.  A total of 28 redwood and 47 Douglas fir trees were released in this reach.   Douglas fir trees ranged from 1.6-12.1 inches in diameter, with an average of 3.9 inches, while the diameter of redwood trees ranged from 1.6-14.3 inches, averaging 5.7 inches.  Douglas fir tree ranged from 8-80 feet with an average height of 28 feet, while redwoods ranged in height from 10-70 feet, with an average of 29 feet.  A total of 125 alders were thinned while releasing these conifers along South Fork Ah Pah Creek. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: While on a specific watershed level the improvements in habitat have been clear and are continuing to mature with successive maintenance projects, at the larger Klamath River basin level the benefits to salmon have been challenged by larger political and ecological concerns.  In 2002, an enormous salmon kill occurred on the lower Klamath River as a consequence of elevated water temperatures.  Between 35,000 and 70,000 fish are thought to have died as a consequence. While pinpointing the problem has been a challenge for ecologists, the reduced flows in that year are thought to have been a significant contributor.  Due to continuing drought in the enormously productive agricultural region in the Upper Klamath, water for downstream purposes was curtailed in the summer of 2001.  These swirling political concerns have continued up to the present day, when at this writing a provisional settlement on the Klamath River basin has been announced pending approval of PacificCorp.  The agreement proposes to remove four major hydroelectric dams from the river.  If this project proceeds its initial completion date is 2015 and will represent the largest dam decommissioning in the United States and  no doubt will expand the efforts of the Klamath River basin restoration.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Because the Klamath River is such an important river for salmon, restoration of salmon habitat is essential for their continued survivial.  To the Yurok it is critical because salmon are the foundation of their culture and restoration of the Klamath to support continued salmon habitat is critical as well.  Salmon is vital to the larger region because of its value as a food source and the economic importance it has all along the Northern California and Oregon coast to fisherman.
After implementing the North Coast Riparian Restoration Project (of which Ah Pah Creek was a part), managers decided that in the future, proposals for this size of restoration project need to address site preparation and long term maintenance in order to ensure high seedling survival rates. In addition, the growing conditions of each planting site need to be evaluated to improve appropriate tree species selection. The lessons learned from this project were well applied in the Riparian Restoration Project Maintenance on Lower Klamath River Tributaries. Californina Conservation Corps (CCC) crews in-planted approximately 9,500 trees and completed tree maintenance on eight Lower Klamath River tributaries. Tree species planted included Sitka spruce, Coastal redwood, and Grand fir. Most of the areas planted were stream side terraces dominated by alder and dense understory brush. These conditions required trees that could thrive in shaded, wet locations. Coastal redwoods were planted in densely shaded areas and lower terraces. Grand firs were planted in more open, sunlit areas, and Sitka spruce were planted at all the sites because of their high tolerance of stream terrace conditions. Douglas fir was not planted on any of the sites due to its intolerance of dense shade and seasonal inundation. The trees in-planted and maintenanced during this project had high survival rates of 80% to 90%. This was higher than the survival rates observed before the maintenance projects implementation. These increases confirm that the lessons learned from other riparian plantings were well-applied on this maintenance project. CCC crews attended a three day training in January 2005 focused around tree planting techniques, conditions preferred by tree species and common planting/ maintenance mistakes. The training was developed with the intention of providing crews better information with which to make planting decisions. These decisions would then be reflected in a reduction of tree mortalities caused by improper planting. At this time it is hard to judge how effective these trainings were in improving tree survival rates for trees planted in February 2005. The survival surveys conducted were unable to separate tree mortalities by year.
One item of note from the mainenance project is that the removal or readjustment of Vexar tubes also proved important to future tree survival. For example, the majority of the redwood trees planted on Hunter Creek over three years ago were greater than 2 feet tall. At this time, the Vexar tree protectors were no longer providing any protection from deer browse. Such instances reiterated the need for long term maintenance on planting projects. In addition, trees planted in flood prone areas with Vexar were found completely bent over. Flood events in the winter of 2004-2005 had pushed over and/or pulled the tree protectors from some of the trees. The Vexar had become a hindrance, weighting down and bending the trees in these areas. In the future, Vexar tubes will not be placed on seedlings planted in flood prone areas. The Yurok Tribe will monitor project work using photo documentation. Point locations were established at critical sites to create a photographic record of physical sites to create a record of physical changes through time for at least five years and possibly longer. Restoration geologists and staff make site visits throughout the year, particularly during the winter months following large storms. Sediment transport trends in the watersheds are monitored by repeat aerial photography.
Monitoring of fish habitat quality occurs using surveys conducted by biologists of the Yurok Tribal Fisheries Department. Photopoints were also monitored before, during and after project implementation and annually thereafter for 3-5 years.
Spawner surveys are being conducted several times each year to evaluate targeted species use structures and movement past barriers. These surveys will continue for the foreseeable future.
USFWS makes site visits at least once a year, and will for a duration of ten years, to ensure initial and continued compliance with project goals. Photopoints have been established before and after implementation, and thereafter for 5-10 years, to monitor physical habitat changes. In addition, cross-sections were established and are being monitored. An aerial photo was taken prior to project implementation of Phase 1 of this project, and further aerial photos will be taken before implementation of Phase 2 of the project and again 1-2 years later. The Simpson Timber Company established a monitoring site in this area as part of their long-term stream channel monitoring program to document the response of watersheds to disturbances and to collect data that will help provide a better understanding of channel processes and stream dymanics.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/chile-restoration-and-rehabilitation-of-mixed-espinales-in-central-chile/	Chile: Restoration and Rehabilitation of Mixed Espinales in Central Chile	Chile	1989-01-15	2008-01-15	"Chilean espinales, located in the unrrigated portions of the central valley of the country’s Mediterranean climate region, provide the framework for subsistance-level agriculture and animal husbandry for approximately 300,000 people. This research and development program has been aimed at the ecological and economic rehabilitation of agroecosystems in these espinales. Data in this study has been collected on: (1) revised management techniques aimed at restoring the gross superstructure and former levels of diversity and productivity of a mixed espinales formation; (2) selection and utilization of ecotypes of the naturalized annual Medicago polymorpha L. and the N2-fixing microsymbiont Rhizobium meliloti, for gradual improvement of espinal soil fertility; and (3) studies of the outstandingly well adapted and fast growing Canary Island tree Chamaecitysus proliferus ssp. palmensis (Tagasaste), which along with about three dozen other woody nitrogen-fixing legume and several nonlegume multipurpose trees, was considered to be of potential value for deep soil layer rehabilitation combined with economic improvements. In all these subprograms, efforts were made to identify techniques or organisms that could provide short-term benefits to landowners, especially in the form of wood, fuelwood, or forage for livestock. Various approaches are planned to be added to the program over the next decade, especially in view of the overarching goal of reintegrating fragmented landscapes and combining restoration with rehabilitation and reallocation at this spatial scale.Agriculture & Livestock Over the past 465 years, the Central Valley has been rapidly and profoundly transformed in the pursuit of wheat and meat production, and the secano interior now generally carries vegetation types of low productivity and species richness used in a number of low-input, low-output farming and animal husbandry systems. These production systems, handicapped by depleted soils and unfavorable world market conditions, are now undergoing a deep crisis in many sectors. In their place, a green tide of industrial forestry plantations is unfurling, especially in the southern, more rain-fed slopes and portions of the region, proceeding in recent years at an average rate of about 120,000 ha/yr. Thus, what bio- and eco-diversity does survive in the secano interior, along with the sociocultural heritage related to traditional farming systems, is gravely threatened.
Espinales now occur on virtually all gentle slopes and plains where the original sclerophyllous vegetation (matorral) has been cleared, and where overgrazing is a severe and chronic disturbance. The introduction of exotic herbivores (cattle and European rabbits) also contributes to maintaining Chilean espinales in their present state. Soils in the area are badly leached, with pH 6.0-6.5 and very low nutrient levels. A long history of shallow cultivation, with animal traction only, and uncontrolled pastoral use have also led to severe compaction of most soils, some of which are therefore subject to periodic inundations in low-lying areas. Consequently, wafer infiltration is poor and rainfall is mostly ineffective for vegetation. Acacia caven forms a nearly monospecific shrub stratum, and most of the herbaceous understory consists of exotic annuals of little forage value.
A regional study of land occupation based on aerial photographs and field surveys was undertaken on a representative transect covering an area of 22,970 ha in the espinales in the subhumid zone. This study revealed that 70% of the study area was occupied by espinales, of varying levels of tree cover, more or less equally divided between the flatlands (llanos) and hillsides (lomas). An additional 4% of the study area was occupied by low shrublands known as romerillales after the dominant shrub Baccharis linearis (Ruiz et Pavon) (romerillo), a formation that is an indicator of overexploited and abandoned cereal fields. Only 2% of the espinales, primarily in the llanos, have been consistently managed with a sustainable silvopastoral approach that appears appropriate to the vegetation structure as well as being economically viable. It was also found that only in the llanos did there exist formations that readily lend themselves to silvicultural improvement. These correspond to espinales with 26Â­-50% tree cover and that occupy about 46% of the llanos in the transect, i.e., about 27% of the total of the study area. Only about 6.2% of the lomas in the study area were found to retain any recognizable remnants of the indigenous sclerophyllous matorral vegetation. The region has various endemic plant species with affinities to the tropics, the Antarctic and the Andes. About 95% of the native plant species are Chilean endemic, including Gomortega keule, Pitavia punctata, Nothofagus alessandrii and Jubaea chilensis. The Chilean matorral has several threatened plant species; some endangered species are Adiantum gertrudis, Avellanita bustillosii and Beilschmiedia berteroana. Seven endemic birds are found in this ecoregion, including Chilean tinamous, moustached turcas, and Chilean mockingbirds. Other birds in the area include Andean condors, red-backed hawks, mountain parakeets, and long-tailed meadowlarks. Coastal species include Humbolt penguins, royal and Buller’s albatrosses, pink-footed shearwaters, and Inca terns. Mammals in the ecoregion include the yaca (a medium-sized mouse opossum), pichi (a small, hairy armadillo), South American and gray fox, kodok (a rare, housecat-sized wildcat), Andean cat, puma, and pudu (the smallest deer in the Western Hemisphere).It is futile to imagine a full restoration of the indigenous formations of which the pre-European structure and composition are largely unknown and which, in any case, could not support the existing human populations. Thus realistic restoration goals follow a post-Conquest model consisting of multilayered, species-enriched landscapes similar to what apparently occurred in the study area in the 16th-Â­19th centuries. Not only did the espinales contain several tree species other than espino, but these formations were integrated in a mosaic including intensively cultivated fields and vineyards, as well as a much more extensive number of woodland and matorral fragments, some of which at least were purposely protected as long-term timber and hunting reserves. Based on many historical and first-hand accounts, the fertility and productivity of espinales of the region have declined steadily since the middle of the last century, and this no doubt has to do with the short-term mining of soils since that time. The ultimate goal of this project is the rehabilitation of these espinales, through increased soil fertility, to a situation of “mixed espinales” such as were common 100 years ago. This goal is also based on the existence of farmers who have chosen or have been convinced to manage their A. caven and other trees as a useful resource.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Chilean espinales provide the framework for subsistance-level agriculture and animal husbandry for approximately 300,000 people. Thus, ecological restoration or rehabilitation cannot be disassociated from agriculture and livestock management practices. On the contrary, it is only by incorporating economically beneficial changes in these human activities that increased biodiversity and other environmental desiderata can be achieved.

Description of Project Activities: BNF Trees and Shrubs

To study BNF in legume trees in espinal soils in conjunction with growth rates, a  controlled field experiment was undertaken utilizing a local provenance of Acacia caven, along with Chamaecitysus proliferus ssp. palmensis (Tagasaste), Prosopis chilensis (Mol.) Stuntz. emend. Burkart, and P. alba Grisebach. 

Over 6 years, Chamaecitysus proliferus ssp. palmensis (Tagasaste) consistently showed growth rates several times greater than all other species used, attaining 3.5 m in height and 9.0 cm dbh.  In addition, nodulation and the amount of N2 fixed by this remarkable species were an order of magnitude higher than in any other species. 

The amount of nitrogen accumulated per plant was also 10Â­-30 times greater in Tagasaste than in any of the other three NFLs tested (or the two nonfixing reference species).  A. caven was shown to have one of the highest nodule efficiency values of any NFL on record.  This may explain in part its remarkable success in disturbed lands in central Chile and throughout southern South America. 

In terms of their effects on soils through BNF, however, Tagasaste stands out remarkably.  Tagasaste appears capable of contributing remarkably large quantities of N to espinal soils, i.e., in excess of 70 kg N/ha/yr in the second year, 129 kg N/ha/yr in the sixth year, and a total of 496 kg N/ha for the entire experimental period.  The other three species tested fixed between 0 and 18 kg N/ha/yr in any single year and between 5 and 62 kg N/ha over 6 years.  In a concurrent study on a nearby site at Cauquenes, 6-year-old Tagasaste was found to be capable of producing 4.4 Mg DW of edible, nutritious phytomass per year of immediate use for livestock of all kinds.  At a coastal site, on sandy soils with 1200 mm mean annual rainfall, remarkable yields of 9 tons/ha/yr were recorded in the sixth year of growth. 

Annual Legumes 

In addition to studies on NFL trees and shrubs, annual legumes were also studied.  From experiences recorded elsewhere, and especially in climatologically comparable areas in western Australia, annual Medicago species appeared highly promising for the secano interior.  Moreover, at least nine different species are found naturalized throughout the area and showed very clear potential for selection and improvement as ecotypes and cultivars for each agroclimatological subregion.  The most widespread, prolific, and polymorphic of these, Medicago polymorpha, was selected for particular attention. Starting in 1989, seeds of this species were field-collected in 59 sites along the natural aridity gradient running from La Serena (30Â°S, 150 mm mean annual precipitation) and Temuco (39Â°S, 1200 mm mean annual precipitation).  These accessions were sown at Cauquenes with the main objective of characterizing their relative phenology and productivity under common garden conditions.  Among many other results, precocity, i.e., time from emergence to first flowering, varied from 82 and 129 days, with a very tight relation existing between latitude of collecting site and precocity.  This trait is of great importance for the long-term persistence of a stand or population of an annual medic under dry farming conditions, since it will often be the critical factor in determining its survival over the annual drought period.  Thus the marked ecotypic variation in this trait could be put to use immediately in a selection and breeding program that has already yielded a number of commercial varieties that will soon be released for Chilean (and foreign) farmers. 

In parallel with the selection of M . polymorpha ecotypes, selection and improvement of rhizobial inoculants also began, with 33 isolates taken from soils of some of the 59 medic accessions.  The two most efficient strains were isolated from collections made at Combarbala, Santa Dolores, and Chanaral alto, and these are all now commercially available from INIA.  A similar effort was also initiated with subterranean clover and several additional species of Trifolium (T . michelianum Boiss. [Balansa clover] , T. incarnatum L. and T. resupinatum L. [ Persian clover] , and T. vesiculosum L.), incorporating a large number of acessions imported from Australia, Spain, and Portugal.  Here again, the objective was to select precocious varieties showing high percentages of hard (i.e., dormant) seeds for use in specific edaphic conditions where M . polymorpha fails to prosper.  After several years of field evaluation in a variety of sites, four Portugese varieties (Santiago de Cacem, Ponte de Ajuda, Sao Romao, and Argelino) and one Spanish variety (Areces) all showed higher DM production that the Australian var. Clare in common use in Chile today.  In addition, a group of precocious varieties, including var. Areces and var. Santiago de Cacem, was identified for use in rotational systems with wheat, e.g., the so-called ley-farming system.  The experimental inclusion of M. polymorpha in existing systems has already been shown to have a dramatic positive impact on organic matter content as well as N, P, and K content in espinal soils.  These results are similar to those obtained in Australia and in Chile under more controlled conditions.  Still more significant results can be expected from the selected cultivars that are just now entering into usage.  More general rehabilitator effects are also apparent in relatively short periods from the use of both annual and woody perennial NFLs. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: So far, experimental introductions of various NFLs has been accomplished, with the goal of eventually encouraging widespread land management practices that will ameliorate structural and biological soil conditions, facilitate the spontaneous reintroduction of native plants, microbes, and animals, and ultimately help improve overall productivity and stability of the espinales. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: In the short-term, revegetation can be too costly for most small land-owners to afford, especially in view of the degraded state of most espinal soils and the ubiquitous presence of voracious rabbits and hares, both of which render tree and shrub planting a somewhat risky and costly affair.  This problem may be ameliorated to some extent by utilizing alternative crop rotation systems designed to improve soil fertility while also increasing cashflow on medium-size farms.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Evidence exists that revised management of NFLs in degraded espinales, including A. caven, will positively affect soil fertility, as well as pasture composition and productivity.  In all subprograms of this project, efforts were made to identify techniques or organisms that could provide short-term benefits to landowners, especially in the form of wood, fuelwood, or forage for livestock.
Only a small proportion of the espinales (~25%) of the secano interior appear to lend themselves to a straightforward restoration process via revised sylvopastoral management and and the reintroduction of selected native trees and shrubs. All the rest of the study area has undergone such degradation and apparent overdomination (shall we say, parasitism ?) by Acacia caven that other responses appear necessary: either rehabilitation or else outright reallocation to new land-use systems bearing no direct relationship to historical formations such as the mixed espinales. This study confirms the hypothesis that NFLs can be found that are adapted to dryland conditions in the secano interior and that can have dramatic and apparently beneficial effects on soils in relatively short periods of time. The two annual legumes and Tagasaste had the most spectacular results, but it should be noted that this latter species also caused a decrease in soil pH and in available P. Its very rapid growth rate clearly causes profound changes in all five soil parameters considered and, no doubt, several others. Management is a critical issue in such a situation. Moreover, it is clear that 5 years is not an adequate period to allow confident predictions of long-term effects. At the same time, it can be imagined that in some restoration scenarios, after an initial period of Tagasaste cultivation used to promote a jump-start rehabilitation effect, it would be advisable to then eliminate this species altogether to make room for more balanced combinations of others, notably native species of trees and shrubs with fodder value or other important attributes.
As a complement to a purely ecological approach, we are convinced that the only hope for the degraded lands of the secano interior requires an economic rehabilitation and reinforcement, so that landowners can devote some portion of their resources to the long-term and costly process of ecological restoration and rehabilitation. Our original hypothesis concerning NFLs has clearly been confirmed to the first 10 years of our program ; over the next 10 years, we shall continue along these lines, while also paying greater attention to the opportunities and constraints for recent integration into global markets. This suggests we must encourage and facilitate ever-greater diversity of farm products as well as flexibility in terms of market fluctuations. Finally, we must accept that tourism will play an increasing role in rural economies and ecology in central Chile, as elsewhere. This is all the more reason to promote greater biodiversity through ecological restoration and rehabilitation. In addition to the various rehabilitation tools we are developing, we are also actively pursuing more conventional R&D designed to develop new crops for the small portions of secano lands that can be equipped with irrigation through small-scale dams and canals. To wit, if high-quality grapes, strawberries, or other cash crops can be grown on, say, 5% of a farm lot permanently reallocated to such intensive activities, this will automatically release pressure on the rest of the landholding and facilitate long-term rehabilitation and restoration efforts. In those parts of the R&D program, it should also be emphasized that improved animal husbandry techniques and systems are being developed for the production of value-added products such as cow, sheep, and goat cheeses and organic grapes and other fruits, all of which are seriously underdeveloped products in central Chile. Water resources, especially rainfall and surface runoff, must also be better managed, so that we do not find ourselves perpetually confined to a secano or dryland farming paradigm. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-utah-the-provo-river-restoration-project/	USA: Utah: The Provo River Restoration Project	United States of America	1992-01-15	2008-01-15	"In 1999, work began on 19 km of the Provo River in the Heber Valley to clean-up, and otherwise restore, the habitat and ecological functions of the middle Provo River. This $45 million effort, called the Provo River Restoration Project (PRRP), has now been completed, and the reconfigured channel is among the most heavily fished streams in Utah. Fish and wildlife, including an endangered species, have thrived following restoration efforts. This project is a nationally recognized effort. No other stream in northern Utah has been the subject of such an intense clean up and restoration activity, yet many streams are in as degraded a condition as the Provo once was. Today, the PRRP is viewed as a model for restoration elsewhere in the state.Other The first permanent settlements in the region were established by the Mormon pioneers who arrived in Utah in 1847. A settlement along the Provo River was established in 1849 and water from the river began to be diverted for agricultural irrigation. Thereafter, more farms were established and the population began to grow. Soon water from the Provo River was diverted to other communities. A small fisheries industry developed on the Provo River and at Utah Lake and its tributaries. In the late 1860s and through the 1870s, commercial fishing waned as more water was diverted for agriculture and the amount of fish declined. Thereafter fishing continued in the Provo River with limitations. Today fishing on the Provo River is almost entirely recreational. Population growth and economic development increased demand for water for agricultural irrigation, domestic use, and industrial use. The populations of the cities that use Provo River water exhibited slow growth followed by increased growth after the introduction of the railroad in 1873. The number of cities that use Provo River water has also grown. Local use of the Provo River water continues, but Salt Lake County and other northern communities now also use the water. As regional economies developed and changed, Provo River water was required for different uses. The construction of Geneva Steel in Orem and other manufacturing operations in the 1940s placed a greater demand on Provo River water for industrial use (Donaldson 2005).
In the 1940s, the Provo River Project began, which has diverted, stored, and delivered large quantities of water from numerous Utah watersheds to help meet the needs of central Utah’s citizens. As part of the Provo River Project, the middle Provo has received additional water from trans-mountain diversions from the Weber and Duchesne Rivers on the south slope of the Uinta mountains. To accommodate the high flows resulting from this diverted water, the middle Provo River was channelized and confined between dikes. As a result of this channel alteration, the complex middle Provo River ecosystem, in which fish and wildlife thrived, was lost. In the early 1990s, the Jordanelle Dam was constructed on the Provo River for storage as a feature of the Central Utah Project (WFHI 2007). Residential growth has also increased demand for water for domestic uses, including lawn and garden care. Water from the Provo River is currently used for recreation, agricultural irrigation, culinary water, and power generation. The Provo River is a popular fishing stream. Floating the river is also a popular activity. The Provo River currently provides drinking water for 50 percent of the population of the state of Utah (Donaldson 2005).
The Middle Provo was significantly impacted by the construction of the two dams that define its boundaries, and by subsequent flood control and irrigation projects. The Middle Provo is that segment of the Provo River that lies between the Jordanelle Reservoir and the Deer Creek Reservoir. Below Deer Creek, the river flows to Utah Lake, which is southeast of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Prior to the 1940s, the middle Provo River meandered freely through the Heber Valley, offering outstanding fish and wildlife habitat. The bends in the river provided deep holes for fish and a dense streamside forest for many species of birds (URMCC 2008). The Provo River Restoration Project (PRRP) is simple in its objective: to create a more naturally functioning river system for the middle Provo River between Jordanelle Dam and Deer Creek Reservoir (URMCC). The project aims to accomplish its restoration mission by focusing on the restoration of natural fluvial processes.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission (URMCC) is federally mandated to assure that mitigation for federal reclamation projects in Utah are accomplished. The URMCC is responsible for implementing the Provo River Restoration Project (PRRP) (URMCC 2008). The PRRP is also being undertaken under the general authority of the Secretary of the Interior to manage and correct problems arising from federal reclamation projects.
When the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation built Jordanelle Dam they were required to acquire 135 acres of private property along the middle Provo River to help provide a public access corridor downstream of the Dam. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) and The Nature Conservancy are cooperators in the acquisition effort (URMCC 2008).
The PRRP has been planned among government agencies, outdoor groups, biologists, local officials and the general public over the last ten years.

Description of Project Activities: Prior to 1992 it was suggested that structures be added to the middle Provo River to create pools and other habitat for fish as a mitigation measure. This resulted in one of the three alternatives: the Instream Structures Alternative. The URMCC expanded upon this obligation in order to meet its ""ecosystem restoration"" standard and developed the Proposed Action (soon to be accepted), which included returning the middle Provo River to a more naturally functioning condition in order to support additional aquatic species and restoration of wildlife habitat, which more fully responds to the need for mitigating impacts on riparian habitats inundated by Jordanelle Reservoir. The Existing Channel Modification Alternative exists between the aforementioned Proposed Action and Instream Structures alternatives in its ecosystem design.  The Proposed Action, also known as the Riverine Habitat Restoration action was soon approved.  It was the design incorporating the most complexity in adding additional channel features as well as meanders, backwater areas and side channels and a broader floodplain.  In addition this design seeks to maintain a river system over time that will provide wildlife habitat without the need for extensive human intervention (URMCC 1997). One of the biggest challenges faced in the restoration design of the middle Provo River was the altered hydrologic regime placed on the river by the Jordanelle Dam and prior imported water patterns. Because the dam placed artificial demands and controls on the middle Provo River ecosystem, it could not be restored to its pre-disturbance condition. Therefore, the restoration design approach focused on the goal of reestablishing the important physical and biological processes that would sustain the ecosystem under this new hydrologic regime (WFHI 2008).

The following provides a summary description and key characteristics of the chosen plan of action for the Provo River Restoration Project (PRRP) (URMCC 1997):

Summary Description of Plan of Action  -  Riverine Habitat Restoration  -  PRRP

 - Reconstructs and realigns most of the existing river channel and floodplain system in a meandering riffle-pool sequence (where there are alternating shallow and fast and deeper and slower sections of water).
 - Removes existing levees; however, 100-year flood protection would still be provided by the expanded floodplain or new setback levees. The new floodplain would be subject to flooding once every 2 years and once every 5 years with velocities capable of scouring surface soils- these conditions are necessary for natural regeneration of cottonwood trees and other riparian vegetation.
 - Allows the river to flood onto the expanded floodplain and to alter its course (the river channel may widen or move across the floodplain in response to natural forces similarly to how it functioned before channelization).
 - Revegetates disturbed areas along the new floodplain with indigenous plants.
 - Constructs side channels and ponds on both sides of the new river alignment. These would create diverse habitat conditions for spawning and rearing of fishes, especially non-game fishes and other aquatic or amphibious species.

The following was to be implemented whether a plan of action had been approved or not.

 - Providing seven new recreation access points along the Provo River between Jordanelle Dam and Deer Creek Reservoir including parking and restroom facilities;
 - Providing pedestrian access for fishing and related or compatible uses along the Provo River between Jordanelle Dam and Deer Creek Reservoir;
 - Fencing of the public access corridor to control trespass problems;
 - Managing the acquired corridor and constructed access facilities through a management agreement with a state or local entity;
 - Maintaining a minimum instream flow of 125 cfs in the Provo River below Jordanelle Dam.

Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Signs of recovery were seen early in the project (e.g., with the project only about 50% complete substantial increases in brown trout abundance were noted) (Weland and Holden 2002). Approximately 11 miles of river have been restored in the Heber Valley between Jordanelle and Deer Creek reservoirs. The restored channel has a natural design with channel features that provide the habitat variability and structure that would be expected to occur in a natural channel with the physical setting of the middle Provo River. The main channel thread, designed with some irregularity, is free to meander on an 800- to 2,200-foot floodplain. Extending off the main channel is a network of cutoff channels and side channels which skip meanders to convey water primarily during runoff. The cottonwood forest is beginning to return and numerous wetlands have been created in the floodplain that was abandoned at the time of channelization.

Habitat improvements and implementation of a minimum instream flow have also significantly improved aquatic life in the middle Provo River. Restored reaches have been recolonized by macroinvertebrates, through both the drift of insects from upstream areas and egg deposition by flying adult insects. An increase in aquatic habitat diversity, such as side channels, undercut banks, and increased cover from stream bank vegetation, has benefited survival of both game and non-game fishes. The density and biomass of brown trout have increased significantly. However, the average size and condition of trout have been decreasing since 1997. This decrease has been attributed to fishing regulations, which have since been altered. Studies have shown that native fish, particularly leatherside chub, have been vulnerable to predation by brown trout in simplified habitats; however, they have been found in refuge habitats in channels other than the main stem of the Provo River. Off-channel habitats such as backwater areas, side channels, ponds, and old channel cutoffs have been suitable habitats where small native fish have escaped predation. One exception has been the leatherside chub, which have not been observed in the side channels, created as part of the restoration project. The few leatherside chub that have been observed have all been on the mainstem river. The creation of wetlands along the Provo River prevented the Columbia Spotted frog (Rana luteiventris) from becoming a federally listed species.  The frog population has increased substantially since restoration efforts began (Hoffman 2007; Otis 2008; WFHI 2008).
   
Early research studies have shown that the greater geomorphic complexity introduced by channel restoration has increased hyporheic exchange. The hyporheic zone is the area next to the stream channel where there is a mixing (exchange) of surface water and ground water. This interface is important to stream ecosystem function because of biogeochemical processes that occur. Hyporheic exchange can dictate patterns in stream flora and fauna due to focused exchanges of surface water and groundwater (WFHI 2008). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Current trends indicate that the most significant long-term problem that must be addressed concerns the long-term need to re-supply the channel with gravel in order to maintain high quality fisheries habitat.  Gravel re-supply will be an essential component of the PRRP because natural re-supply is blocked by Jordanelle Dam.  The Middle Provo was significantly impacted by the construction of the two dams that define its boundaries.  Because the Jordanelle dam placed artificial demands and controls on the middle Provo River ecosystem, it could not be restored to its pre-disturbance condition (WFHI 2008).

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The increasing trout numbers will translate into increased anglers visiting the area who subsequently support local economies in the valley.  Passive recreation opportunities will increase due to the improved stream and floodplain conditions and established access points.
The Provo River Restoration Project is an innovative $45 million project that focused on restoring the entire ecosystem around the river. The initial planning of the restoration had its fair share of opposition. Today, there is virtually no criticism against it (Hoffman 2007) but at least one criticism of design implementation and evaluation was found (Goetz et al. 2007). However, the ultimate fate of the PRRP is still unknown, because the restored ecosystem is continuing to evolve. Two keys to the project’s initial success were the broad mandate to restore fluvial processes rather than produce a specific end product, and the ability to take a design/build approach to the actual implementation. Lessons learned include coordinating plant installation with plant availability and planting site availability, and irrigating during drought (Rice 2006) Monitoring Data and Collection Methods: In keeping with the ecological approach to the Provo River Restoration Project, an interdisciplinary team of scientists have been contributing their expertise to the project by designing and implementing several studies. These biological and physical studies have provided three essential components for restoration. They have: 1) thoroughly described the baseline physical and biological condition of the river; 2) provided a basis for restoration design; and 3) initiated monitoring that will enable planners to detect measurable change due to restoration activities and to make informed management decisions. Because the final phases of Provo River Restoration Project have just been completed, monitoring for effectiveness of the restoration efforts is just underway, and some ecological responses to the restoration efforts may not be measurable for several years (WFHI 2008).

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-california-restoring-bolsa-chica-wetlands/	USA: California: Restoring Bolsa Chica Wetlands	United States of America	19950711	20060811	"The Bolsa Chica wetlands are located in Orange County, CA, surrounded by the City of Huntington Beach. The project site lies adjacent to the California Department of Fish and Game’s Ecological Reserve and consists of 350 acres of habitat within 1300 acres of lowlands, most of which the State owns. The complicated history to restore the Bolsa Chica wetlands stretches back over several decades but began to reach fruition in the mid-1990s. In October 1996, eight state and federal agencies (California State Lands Commission, California Department of Fish and Game, State Coastal Conservancy, Resources Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Marine Fisheries Service, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) and the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach entered into an Interagency Agreement to establish a project for wetlands acquisition and restoration at the Bolsa Chica Lowlands, located along the northern Orange County shoreline. After almost a decade of planning and support activities, on the ground restoration of nearly 600 acres of Bolsa Chica was begun in 2004. In the summer of 2006 seawater flowed into the restored wetland for the first time in over 100 years facilitating the recreation of wetland habitat benefiting a variety of species including several threatened and endangered species. The Bolsa Chica wetland restoration was the largest coastal wetland restorations ever undertaken in Southern California (Amigos 2008).Fragmentation, Other Partially-developed mesas rise at both the upcoast and downcoast ends of the lowlands. Once part of a 165,000 acre Spanish land grant, during the 1700’s to 1800’s ranching and later agriculture in the area may have impacted the Bolsa Chica. By 1900 the tidal nature of the wetland was essentially destroyed when the natural ocean inlet to the wetland was closed to improve duck hunting. Since then, the area has been used for agriculture, cattle grazing, military coastal artillery emplacements and oil production (Amigos 2008). In the late 1940’s the Pacific Coast Highway and State beach facilities were constructed. The 1300 acres of lowlands are a remnant of a complex of approximately 2500 acres of streams and wetlands that has been reduced in size and degraded by agricultural and urban development and by construction of flood management channels, and oil and extraction facilities. The historical site activity as well as urban runoff draining into the Lowlands has resulted in contamination or physical disturbance of the plants, wildlife or their habitat on the site (USFWS 2008). Bolsa Chica was part of an extensive tidal marsh, including a mosaic of vegetated salt and brackish marsh, with associated tidal embayments, sloughs, mudflats and a direct connection to the ocean (USFWS 2008). Primary project goals included: removing oil production facilities and cleanup associated contaminants; protecting and enhancing marine habitat for coastal and estuarine fisheries resources; increasing and enhancing habitat for migratory waterfowl, seabirds, and shorebirds; providing habitat for endangered species; and Incorporating passive and non-intrusive human activity (USFWS 2008).

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
In October 1996, eight state and federal agencies (California State Lands Commission, California Department of Fish and Game, State Coastal Conservancy, Resources Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Marine Fisheries Service, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) and the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach entered into an Interagency Agreement to establish a project for wetlands acquisition and restoration at the Bolsa Chica Lowlands (California Coastal Commission 2005). The Bolsa Chica Wetlands Restoration Steering Committee consisted of representatives from the eight different agencies referred to prior. To assist the USFWS in the management and administration of the project, Moffatt & Nichol Engineers was contracted for construction management. To construct all elements of the restoration project, that included the two bridges, jetties, dredging, earthwork, and groundwater barrier, the Service selected the Kiewit Pacific Company (USFWS 2008). Three citizen groups, the Amigos de Bolsa Chica, the Bolsa Chica Land Trust and the Bolsa Chica Conservancy all play a significant role in restoration efforts of the Bolsa Chica Wetlands.

Description of Project Activities: In October 1996 the Interagency Agreement described a Concept Plan for wetland restoration and addressed: (1) the acquisition of approximately 880 acres of land in the Bolsa Chica Lowlands; (2) the restoration of wetlands, full tidal, and managed tidal habitats in the lowlands; (3) monitoring activities to determine the condition of restored habitats; and (4) the necessary operation, maintenance, and management of project features during and after construction. The Concept Plan included the following planning objectives for the Bolsa Chica restoration project:
 -  Overwintering habitat for migratory shorebirds, seabirds, and waterbirds shall be enhanced.
 -  Nesting habitat for migratory shorebirds and seabirds shall not be diminished and shall be expanded, where feasible.
 -  Habitat for estuarine/marine fishes shall be expanded and species diversity shall be increased.
 -  Nesting and foraging conditions for state and federal endangered species shall not be adversely affected. In addition, implementation of the plan shall contribute to the recovery of the light-footed clapper rail, California least tern, western snowy plover, and Belding's savannah sparrow.
 -  The mix of habitat types shall include perennial brackish ponds, seasonal ponds/sand flats, pickleweed flats, cordgrass intertidal zone, unvegetated intertidal mudflat, and marine subtidal soft bottom.
 -  Modifications to the hydraulic regime (necessary to achieve the above objectives) shall include an ocean inlet, full tidal range (i.e., +7.5 to  - 1.5 feet mean lower low water), and low residence time, and shall emphasize minimized requirements for manipulation and maintenance and not degrade existing flood protection levels.
 -  Interests of contiguous property owners shall be protected.
 -  Once completed, maintenance and management of the area shall maximize native estuarine/marine fish and wildlife habitat of the Bolsa Chica Lowlands in perpetuity, including active removal of detrimental, non-native biota.
 -  Allowable public uses shall include passive and nonintrusive recreation activities focused on peripheral areas, interpretive foci, and trails.
 -  Total removal of oil extraction activities and their past effects shall be conducted in a phased, cost-effective, and environmentally sensitive manner.
 -  Monitoring and evaluation of the success of biological objectives shall be conducted.

Between 1997 and 2004, the state acquired an additional 965 acres of Bolsa Chica, setting the stage for a major restoration project involving nearly 600 acres. Restoration ground breaking occurred on October 6, 2004. Project phases included: Phase 1: A critical feature of the wetlands restoration is an inlet from the sea to supply life-giving tidal flow into the restored wetland.  The first task was the construction of a bridge to allow Pacific Coast Highway traffic to pass over the ocean inlet. To protect the new bridge from storm waves, the bridge had to be raised higher than the level of the original highway. For additional storm wave protection, 31,000 tons of stone were used to build revetments on the west-facing side of the bridge. Phase 2: The 380 acres of the full tidal basin had to be cleared of all oil field remnants:  64 oil wells were removed and capped and 27 miles of pipes, 230 power poles, tons of machinery, brush and contaminated soil were hauled out. In addition, several miles of maintenance roads were leveled. The ecological risk assessment identified the types and concentrations of chemical contaminants present on the site and what chemicals may pose a risk to birds or other wildlife.  The knowledge gained through development of the ecological risk assessment guided successful clean up efforts. Phase 3: Two sandy islands were constructed as nesting sites for the thousands of terns, skimmers and plovers that visit the Bolsa Chica each spring and summer. Phase 4: The full tidal area was excavated with heavy construction machinery down to about sea level. Over 2.5 million cubic yards of sand and soil were eventually removed from the full tidal basin.  The full tidal basin was flooded to about 5 feet of water to float a dredge that would do the final contouring of the basin. A perimeter levee was constructed to contain the water in the full tidal basin once it was open to the ocean. Three culverts were installed to supply the muted tidal wetland with water from the full tidal basin. To protect nearby residences from water intrusion, a 10,000 foot ground water barrier was employed. Phase 5: Dredging of the full tidal basin provided the final bottom contour. 72,000 tons of rock went into the construction of the two jetties to protect the ocean inlet. Phase 6: Of the sand removed from the full tidal basin, 1.3 million cubic yards were used to construct an ebb shoal to provide sand stability to nearby beaches. Phase 7: A third nesting island was completed, bringing the new nesting sites to a total of 20 acres. Limited excavation of the 138 acre muted tidal area was carried out to insure adequate water circulation. Phase 8: In the early morning of August 24, 2006, the inlet was opened to allow tidal water to enter nearly 600 acres of Bolsa Chica. About 190,000 cubic yards of sand taken from the inlet were added to the nearby beach for sand replenishment (Amigos 2008; USFWS 2008). The Amigos de Bolsa Chica have provided off-site programs and guided tours of the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve for thousands and school children and adults (Amigos 2008). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Recovery evaluation and monitoring are ongoing. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The site is surrounded by various sources of potential degradation and contamination including urban roadways (including a state highway), housing, human recreation, oil and extraction facilities, and urban runoff draining into the Lowlands.  All may result in contamination or physical disturbance of the plants, wildlife or their habitat on the site (USFWS 2008).

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The project was especially needed because more than 90% of Southern California's original coastal wetlands have been lost to development, making the remaining wetlands critical for migratory birds along the Pacific Flyway, wildlife and fish. These salt marshes served as nurseries for commercially and recreationally important fish including California halibut (USFWS 2008)
The Bolsa Chica wetland restoration was the largest coastal wetland restorations ever undertaken in Southern California (Amigos 2008). The project restored full and muted tidal wetlands function to almost 600 acres of the Bolsa Chica Wetlands. The increased quantity and quality of open water and intertidal mudflat habitats at Bolsa Chica will provide overwinterintg habitat for migratory shorebirds, seabirds, and waterfowl. A diverse community of marine and estuarine invertebrates will undoubtedly flourish In the full and muted tidal basins. Restoration of full tidal influence will recreate conditions that will be very benenficial for up to 60 species of fish. The project went forward and it appears has a good chance of success in spite of significant sources of disturbance surrounding the area. The Bolsa Chica wetlands are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game. A Beach Monitoring Plan and Long-term Ecological Monitroing Program are in place. These plans describe historical data and studies available for the area, and provide definition of monitoring activities and analyses that are expected to assure adverse impacts to area beaches are mitigated. The purpose of the Bolsa Chica wetlands long-term ecological monitoring program is to document the habitat improvements for fish and wildlife, the success of revegetation efforts, and the use of the site by endangered species (USFWS 2008).
The ecological monitoring objectives are:
– Facilitate evaluation of the effectiveness of the restoration to provide habitat for fish and
wildlife;
– Document changes in the ecology of the wetlands environment over time;
– Provide timely identification of any problems with the physical, or biological
development of the restored area;
– Assist in providing a technical basis for resource management of the restored wetland by
documenting maintenance needs and enhancement opportunities. "

The island has been used in the last decade as a fuel storage depot by three successive companies. Imminent decommissioning of the petroleum activities on the island require that buffel grass control be undertaken to ensure that the weed is contained, controlled or eradicated. Though the lessee is only required under agreement to control buffel grass and revegetate in the leased area (approximately half of the island), they are undertaking a program to try to eradicate buffel grass from the entire island and revegetate areas, where necessary.The aims of this project are to eradicate buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) from Airlie Island, to develop and implement methods to restore indigenous vegetation, and to collect and store seed for future restoration works. The most effective herbicides under these conditions were determined, and extensive field trials indicated the main perennial shrubby species on the island are resistant to the two selected (Roundup and Verdict). The window of opportunity for spraying is only about two weeks. Results of the spraying on Airlie Island indicate that 98% of the original stands of buffel grass has been controlled. Replanting with greenstock is preferable after heavy rainfall, the main shrubby species planted after spraying with Roundup can then be oversprayed, when required, with Verdict. Two to four sprays a year, depending on rainfall events, are required for a period of at least three years (estimated age of soil seed bank) to control this weed with follow up monitoring and backpack spot spraying or hand removal.Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) Buffel grass seed was most likely brought to Airlie Island in soil used in the construction of the lighthouse in 1913. By 1987, buffel grass roughly occupied a 2.5 ha kidney-shaped area around the lighthouse. The initial spread of buffel was relatively slow; however, disturbance events appear to have enhanced its invasive capacity.
On Airlie Island the presence of buffel grass threatens the natural plant communities by replacing, almost entirely, the understory cover of indigenous grasses and herbs. Buffel grass has already become a dominant plant species on the island and other islands along the Pilbara coast. This environmental weed substantially increases the fire risk, which may impact the habitat of local fauna and may cause significant and permanent changes in vegetation structure and diversity. At the start of spraying in 1999, buffel grass formed a near monospecific stand over eight hectares (33%) of the island. This weed may release allelopathic chemicals into the soil that inhibit growth of other species, potentially acting as a key displacement agent for most of the native vegetation. Buffel grass may also be detrimental to the island’s fauna, especially the breeding cycle of shearwaters and the survival of herpetofauna. The rainfall pattern, lack of permanent surface water and small size of the island means the vegetation must be drought tolerant and able to cope with salt-laden wind. Most of the island is dominated by two Acacia species (A. bivenosa and A. coriacea), with Rhagodia preissii, Eulalia aurea and now buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) as the major perennials. Shorelines are dominated by Spinifex longifolius, Ipomoea pescaprae, Sporobolus virginicus and Eulalia aurea. During favourable seasons, a large number of annual species can be found in abundance, including Portulaca intraterranea, Euphorbia spp., Boerhavia repleta, Cleome viscosa, Cuscuta australis and Threlkeldia diffusa. The islands off of the Pilbara coast have a variety of seabird nesting records, including pelicans (Pelecanus conspicillatus), wedge-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus) and pied cormorants (Phalacrocorax varius). Mammal fauna includes the pale field-rat (Rattus tunneyi), little red kaluta (Dasykaluta rosamondae), western chestnut mouse (Pseudomys nanus), and short-tailed mouse (Leggadina lakedownensis). Sea turtle nesting is known to occur, but details are sketchy. Dugongs (Dugong dugon) are relatively common in inshore waters. Phase one of this project was to investigate and research the biology of buffel grass and to develop a control program which will integrate eradication or sustainable control of buffel grass with the reinstatement of indigenous species.
Phase two of the project is the control of buffel grass over the whole island based on the results of Phase one, restoration of indigenous communities, and initiation of a seed collection and storage program for future revegetation works.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The island has been used in the last decade as a fuel storage depot for Western Mining Corporation Petroleum Division, Novus Petroleum’s offshore oilfield projects and by the present lease holder Apache Energy. Imminent decommissioning of the petroleum activities on the island require that buffel grass control be undertaken to ensure that the weed is contained, controlled or eradicated. Though the lessee is only required under agreement to control buffel grass and revegetate in the leased area (approximately half of the island), they are undertaking a program to try to eradicate buffel grass from the entire island and revegetate areas, where necessary.

Description of Project Activities: Phase One

Spray plot sizes were 1x1 m, each separated by a 0.5 m-wide corridor.  Three replicas of each plot were made within each trial site. All plots were sprayed working systematically across the plot and back again in the opposite direction to ensure even coverage. Compressed sheeting was used as a barrier to ensure there was no drift onto other plots. 

Three multi-herbicide trials were conducted, with Roundup Biactive 6 l/ha and Verdict 8 l/ha achieving a high kill rate.  Large-scale (100m2) trials were attempted with Roundup and Verdict, and were aimed at confirming the effectiveness of these herbicides sprayed on a larger scale prior to the implementation phase. 

Phase Two

Roundup Biactive at 8 l/ha and Verdict at 6 l/ha were used.  The strategy employed Roundup in the first spraying operation as there were few annual indigenous plants emerged that might be affected by the spray.  Then Verdict used as a blanket spray as annuals and possibly some native perennial plants are at a susceptible stage.  Each spraying unit requires two operators, one as a sprayer and the other to release and withdraw the hose. In dense stands we used a blanket spray technique, and in other areas spot spray. 

Three rounds of spraying were conducted from 1999-2000.  The first round used Roundup for ease of operations and because it is more cost effective than using Verdict. Herbicide application was following six weeks of heavy soaking rain.  Ideally the spraying program should have been initiated two weeks earlier, as most of the buffel grass had just reached first anthesis and early seeding.  The buffel grass was in rapid growth with some plants beginning to dry out by the fourth day of spraying.  Most of the application was blanket spraying of heavily-infested buffel areas, avoiding as many indigenous plants as possible with very few annual seedlings present.  Previously-sprayed areas were spot sprayed, avoiding contact of Verdict on Eulalia to reduce damage to planted greenstock and annual indigenous plants. Though original trials indicated Eulalia aurea was resistant to the grass-selective herbicides, subsequent trials showed they were very sensitive and future spraying would need to avoid excessive contact with Eulalia. 

The second round of spraying was mainly blanket spraying resprouts and seedlings with Roundup, as there was such a large amount to spray and low levels of annual indigenous plants in the previously-sprayed area.  Some spot spraying with Roundup in outlier areas and spot spraying Verdict over replanted areas was done. 

The third round of spraying followed six weeks of substantial rainfall on the island as a result of a cyclone.  The buffel was in excellent condition for spraying.  About half of the area (low impact area) was sprayed with Roundup, and the remainder (rich herb fields) with Verdict.  Backpack sprayers were used on outlier populations.  A thorough inspection after the spraying operation detected some other plants which were removed by hand.  At this stage we estimate most of the seedlings and over 98% of mature buffel grass plants on the island were eradicated.


All seed for the greenstock propagation portion of Phase two was collected from Airlie Island to ensure only local provenances were utilised.  Plants of A. coriacea, A. bivenosa, Rhagodia preissii and Eulalia aurea were propagated from seed in glasshouses at Kings Park and Botanic Garden and transported to Airlie Island.  Acacia seed were hot-water treated and left to soak overnight.  Seed was sown into punnets and after about six weeks, seedlings were pricked out into tubes.  Seed was sown in summer for planting in early winter of the following year.

Benchmarking (using quadrats and transects) in pristine areas of the island gave a figure of natural plant density and the estimated number of plants required for revegetation of bare areas. This density was doubled to allow for assumed seedling death.  The total area requiring revegetation is estimated at one hectare; this excludes the leased area which is to be revegetated after decommissioning the oil facilities.

The first planting trial in April 1998 consisted of A. bivenosa, A. coriacea, Rhagodia preissii, and Eulalia aurea which were planted into moist soil.  A further trial in June/July used only 200 A. bivenosa.  A large trial in June 1999 used 1400 plants: A. bivenosa and E. aurea in high numbers; A. coriacea and R. preissii in low numbers.  These were planted in very dry conditions.  Planting was in a number of locations in areas previously heavily-infested with buffel grass. After cleaning with bleach and thoroughly rinsing, the spraying units and long hoses were utilised to water the plants in.

The results from the first two planting trials were outstanding, with 89% to 97% of all species surviving and growing vigorously 10 weeks after planting.  The large planting in June 1999 was a failure, with no rain for six months after planting.  Almost all the plants of all species died. Though no exact count was done, a few plants of A. bivenosa are alive in two or three locations, with survival of <1% 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: We estimate most of the seedlings and over 98% of mature buffel grass plants on the island were eradicated.  Seedlings may germinate from the soil seed bank.  However, the viability of the soil seed bank is rapidly declining and sustainable control of buffel grass will depend upon careful monitoring and a judicious ""˜mop-up' spray program. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Some of the key constraints that were addressed were:

-Getting the equipment on the island.  This was trucked up to the remote townsite of Onslow then placed on a barge which goes to the island once a week.  No large, heavy or dangerous items can be carried on the helicopters which take personnel to the island from Barrow Island, the direct flight destination from Perth. 
-No internal combustion engines are allowed on the island (due to possible hydrocarbon contamination/spills), therefore we had to use battery-operated spraying units. Water supply for spraying is from a reverse osmosis supply generated on the island, rainwater also goes into the tanks.  This supply is limited; on one occasion the pipe to the tanks burst and we only had just enough water for spraying operations. 
-Cyclones during spraying operations.  When these develop the island is evacuated and all operations ceased. 
-The 250 litre spray tanks have to be carried to each station by hand, as no vehicles are allowed in the natural vegetation areas. It is therefore necessary to judge very carefully how much material you need in the tank to finish off the area. 
-Coping with the extreme weather conditions (e.g. 36Â°C and 80% humidity during summer spraying operations) and difficult working conditions (e.g. walking backwards when spraying) and abundant dead twigs which fouled boots and clothing.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Outcomes of this study will be directly relevant to the decommissioning of the Airlie Island oil installation while providing benchmark data on the control of buffel grass. The study will therefore be of regional, national and international significance to land managers and conservation agencies where buffel grass is an environmental weed. Information on buffel grass control generated from this program is already being utilised by local land managers on adjacent islands and adjacent mainland as well as other areas in Australia such as Queensland and central Australia.
The research results from Phase one of the program underpinned the implementation phase. A good knowledge of the biology of the buffel plants opened up a narrow window of opportunity for spraying and optimizing kill rates. Knowledge of seed production, soil seed bank and longevity of seed enabled us to plan ahead with a work schedule.
The initial trials provided an appreciation of the problems and how adaptable you have to be with your implementation program, which is entirely dependent on the vagaries of the weather. The spraying results proved to be inconsistent as every trial was different. However, the results from the large-scale spraying program were used as the basis for the implementation phase. The authors are confident that the herbicides, and their concentrations, used in the implementation phase are ideal for the expected varying conditions of the plants. Future operations, due to the recruitment of herbs in the buffel areas, will be using Verdict to avoid damage to these plants. Planting Eulalia aurea should be delayed until the soil seed bank is eliminated, otherwise further spraying could kill or damage Eulalia.
The best time for spraying adult plants is within the range of three to five weeks after sufficient rain has fallen. If spray is applied too early the seedlings are too small to target and with extra rainfall there may be delayed germination. Also, it is not cost-effective to spray twice when one operation can achieve good results. Under quick drying conditions some plants are beginning to get stressed, and may occasionally drop some mature seed before they are sprayed.
Planting greenstock can give excellent results if the ground is moist and there is follow-up rain. We recommend the best time for planting is in late autumn or early winter, though it can also be dry at this time of the year as experienced in the 1999 trial.
The ongoing success of the control of buffel grass and revegetation of Airlie Island with indigenous species depends upon the good aegis of the funding sponsors who manage the island. The program does show that with careful, focussed research, it is possible to achieve effective and timely weed control in the arid zone. Though the spraying program is in hand, the program has identified an urgent need to revegetate bare areas. The dead below-ground biomass of buffel does provide soil-binding to prevent wind erosion for at least three years, in which time revegetation needs to proceed.
High on the priority list is a comprehensive seed collecting and storage program of all species native to the island, with key areas being the rich herb fields between the Acacias and other perennial plants when decommissioning takes place. Some stabilization trials also need to be undertaken as cyclonic winds are a regular occurrence during the summer season. A recent cyclone altered the shape of the island and caused erosion near a flare installation which is being re-stabilized and revegetated by consultants based on the mainland. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-california-restoring-tidal-wetlands-at-sonoma-baylands-san-francisco-bay/	USA: California: Restoring Tidal Wetlands at Sonoma Baylands, San Francisco Bay	United States of America	1986-10-08	1996-10-08	"The Sonoma Baylands project recreated tidal wetlands using 2.0 million cubic metres of dredged material. The design was based upon an extensive review of the first generation of restoration projects in San Francisco Bay and incorporated the lessons learned from these early projects. The Baylands project used dredged material in far lower quantities than previous projects to assure that the fill served as a template for the development of a wetland with an extensive tidal slough system. The project design also included a series of peninsulas to break up wind-driven waves and increase sedimentation rates. The target species for the project were the endangered California clapper rail and the salt marsh harvest mouse. The use of dredged material reduced the time needed for habitat development by several decades. Implementing the Sonoma Baylands project required a change in policy for the Army Corps of Engineers. The actual costs of adding the wetland project as part of the large navigation improvement project at the Port of Oakland resulted in about a 5% increase in overall project costs (Marcus 2000).Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Over the past 150 years as Europeans and Americans settled in the area, they diked off and filled in nearly 80% of these historic marshes. Tidal marshes were reduced to a mere 10% of their historic acreage. This loss of tidal wetlands caused several endemic species to become endangered, most notably the salt marsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys raviventris) and the California clapper rail (Rallus longirostris obsoletus). Over this same time period, populations of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl decreased significantly. The restoration site is an historic tidal wetland, diked and drained around 1900. Two major transportation corridors, a highway and a railroad, cross through the property, separating it into three “˜parcels’ (Marcus 2000). San Francisco Bay is the largest estuary on the Pacific coast of California. It is the single most valuable area for wintering shorebirds using the Pacific flyway (California State Department of Fish and Game, 1979). Migratory waterfowl also depend heavily on San Francisco Bay. All these birds come to the Bay to feed over the winter. Salt, brackish, and freshwater wetlands once formed a broad ring along the bay shoreline (Marcus 2000).
The concept plan identified relatively low existing wetland values for the three parcels. With the exception of the drainage ditches, there were no wetland plants on the hayfields. Agricultural operations did not allow water to pond and the fields were regularly tilled. Ten years of bird counts for the site recorded large numbers of Brewer’s blackbirds, western meadowlarks, and but few shorebirds or waterfowl (Marcus 2000). Following the acquisition of the property, the first phase of the project was the tidal restoration parcel with a goal of creating endangered species habitat. The “˜tidal parcel’ came to be known as the Sonoma Baylands project. The goals of the design were the creation of low cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) marsh for California clapper rail (Rallus longirostris obsoletus) nesting, high pickleweed (Salicornia pacifica) marsh for the salt marsh harvest mouse (Throdontomys raviventris), and intertidal mudflats for migratory shorebirds (Marcus 2000).

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Preparation of the concept plan involved a series of meetings with the two primary wildlife agencies, the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) and the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). These two agencies at first disagreed over target wildlife species for the plan. CDFG was most concerned with increasing brackish wetland habitats for migratory waterfowl populations. USFWS was more concerned with recreating tidal habitats for endangered species and migratory shorebirds. The design team for the project included, Laurel Marcus, who worked for the California State Coastal Conservancy at the time, Joan Vilms of the Sonoma Land Trust, Dr Ted Winfield, a wetland ecologist with ENTRIX, Drs. Philip Williams and Joan Florsheim, hydrologists with Philip Williams and Associates, and Rick Olejniczak, the project dredging engineer with Gahagan and Bryant Associates (Marcus 2000).
The Port of Oakland and the Army Corps of Engineers needed an acceptable site to dump dredged material for an essential channel-deepening project that was encountering costly delays and causing controversy. Laurel Marcus began a campaign to create a coalition of allies (e.g., organized labor, business and development, shipping lines, the individual ports, regulatory agencies, congressional and state legislative staff, and environmental groups [especially the Save San Francisco Bay Association, Sierra Club, and Natural Heritage Institute]) strong enough to persuade the Corps to shift away from its traditional policy that would not favor the use of the dredged material for creation of a wetland. Eventually the U.S. Congress played the most direct role by passing legislation directing the Corps to conduct the project with 20 years of follow up monitoring and remediation if necessary. Numerous other agencies and non governmental organizations had a stake in the Sonoma Baylands Project including the EPA, Regional Water Quality Control Board, and San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (Marcus 2000).

Description of Project Activities: As a part of the purchase of the property, a concept plan was prepared. This plan evaluated the physical features of the site and identified the types of wetlands that could be restored. The goals of the concept plan included having natural processes create the wetland and minimal operation and maintenance requirements. Pumping and manipulating water or other active management schemes were not considered.  The entire Sonoma Baylands property encompasses 336 ha and has two major transportation corridors, a highway and a railroad, crossing through the property, separating it into three ""˜parcels'. The concept plan documented the conditions on the site, including, elevations for each parcel, the elevations of the culverts in the highway and railroad berms, elevations for the nearby bay wetlands and tidal range, vegetation and wildlife on the site, local rainfall and evaporation data, and the compatibility of current agricultural practices with wetland restoration. The three parcels of the Sonoma Baylands were all roughly 0.6 - 1.2 m below mean sea level enclosed from bay water by levees. As the site was farmed, the organic materials in the wetland soils oxidized and shrank, causing the ground elevations to subside 1.5 - 2.1 m below their original wetland elevations. The culverts that connected the two parcels were set below the 0.0-m NGVD. This elevation restriction combined with a maximum linear distance of 2400 m from a tidal source made tidal restoration of the entire site impractical. The concept plan concluded that only the southern 138-ha parcel could be restored as a natural tidal wetland. The rainfall and evaporation data showed that the other two parcels could be restored as seasonal brackish wetlands. The plan also concluded that the site could remain in agricultural use and open space and fulfill its goals; however, the restoration of wetlands and continued operation of the hayfields were not compatible. Based upon the physical constraints on the site, the concept plan recommended both tidal and brackish marsh, allowing both the state and federal wildlife agencies to endorse the plan (Marcus 2000). 

The concept plan also identified relatively low existing wetland values for the three parcels. With the exception of the drainage ditches, there were no wetland plants on the hayfields. Agricultural operations did not allow water to pond and the fields were regularly tilled. Ten years of bird counts for the site recorded large numbers of Brewer's blackbirds, western meadowlarks, and house finches, but few shorebirds or waterfowl. The first phase of the project was the tidal restoration parcel with a goal of creating endangered species habitat. The ""˜tidal parcel' came to be known as the Sonoma Baylands project. The goals of the design were the creation of low cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) marsh for California clapper rail nesting, high pickleweed (Salicornia pacifica) marsh for the salt marsh harvest mouse, and intertidal mudflats for migratory shorebirds. These wildlife species need complex habitat with slough channels, transitional uplands, and varied patches of marsh types and mudflats as found in a natural system. In San Francisco Bay, pickleweed marsh occurs from a low elevation of +1.8 ft NGVD up to the reach of the highest spring tides, and is dominant at MHHW, +3.5 ft NGVD. Cordgrass marsh occurs from MHW at +2.9 ft NGVD, down to MTL of +0.9 ft NGVD. Intertidal mudflats occur from MTL to MLLW at -2.6 ft NGVD. This complex of varied habitats supplies the greatest wildlife values for the project's target species. There is a natural process of sediment movement and accretion that transforms mudflats into low marsh and then into high marsh. The design of the Sonoma Baylands project incorporated recognition that natural processes create and evolve these habitats. The design focused on the physical processes affecting the site that would form, create, and evolve the wetland habitats and evaluated what construction was needed on the site to assist natural tidal processes in creating these habitats. One aspect of the design was the use of dredged mud to increase base elevations on the site to speed up the development of intertidal areas (Marcus 2000). 

A primary component guiding the design was review and monitoring of other restoration projects. Two of these ""˜first-generation' projects at Muzzi Marsh and Salt Pond Three used dredged material as fill and were resurveyed to evaluate how they had evolved since their construction in the mid 1970s. Several other sites, the Dickson Property, Warm Springs Marsh, and Toy Property, did not use fill but were evaluated for their development following restoration. The first-generation projects that used dredge material were evaluated. The approach used in these early projects was to fill the site to the MHHW elevation, the ultimate level of the mature marsh plain. The cover and diversity of plant species in relation to elevation and the density of tidal channels that had developed at various elevations in the site were evaluated several decades after restoration. Slough channel density was measured as the total length of channels (in miles) per square mile of marsh. A natural marsh at the Corte Madera Ecological Reserve had a density of 53.4 miles (89 km) of channels per square mile of marsh. The Salt Pond Three site covers 40 ha of former salt evaporation ponds filled by the Corps of Engineers in 1974. When surveyed in 1988, the upper portion of the site was 1.7 ft above MHHW and had a low density of drainage channels of 8.6 miles per square mile of marsh. The upper area only supported pickleweed. The lower portion of the site had a higher density of channels at 20.8 miles per square mile of marsh and was at an elevation of MHHW. It also supported only pickleweed. Just after restoration, this lower area had supported cordgrass, but the site had rapidly filled in and was dominated by pickleweed. Muzzi Marsh is a 135-acre site restored in 1976. Dredged mud was placed on 26 ha of the site and spilled over into the other portion. The filled area had a channel density of 29 miles per square mile and was at an elevation of +3.4 ft NGVD or about MHHW. This area was largely pickleweed marsh. The lower area had a channel density of 68.6 miles per square mile of marsh and was at an elevation of 2.3 ft NGVD, or about MHW. The lower area had a diverse habitat of channels, cordgrass, and mudflats. It supported clapper rails as well as shorebirds. The Toy Property, Warm Springs Marsh, and Dickson Property were evaluated for the effect of wind and waves on shoreline erosion, sedimentation rates, and development of the tidal plain. These sites, all diked historic baylands, were flooded with tidal water through the breach of a levee and connection to the bay. All three sites had subsided and when tidal flows were restored, they had large areas of open water subject to strong summer and winter winds. These sites showed several problems derived from wind driven waves including erosion of the perimeter levee requiring expensive repair and a lack of sediment build-up. Sediment is brought into the site with the tide, but does not build up if continuously resuspended by wind-driven waves and transported out. The analysis also evaluated the relationship between the size of the connecting tidal breach on tidal flow volumes and marsh development. From this review, the design team formulated several conclusions, 1. Filling the site to create a finished tidal marsh at an elevation of  3.5 ft NGVD results in inadequate development of tidal channels, the circulatory system for the wetland. Development of an adequate channel system is necessary to achieve a fully functional wetland with diverse habitats. Projects that were filled to a lower elevation of +2.0 ft NGVD allowed for the development of an extensive slough channel system and biologically diverse wetland. 2. A construction element was needed to address the wind-driven waves in tidal restoration projects. The structure would break up waves, still tidal water, and increase sediment deposition during the first decade of the opening of the site. The structures should be arranged on the site to reduce wind fetch distances below 300 m. 3. For most of the sites, a stretch of mudflat and marsh separates the restoration site from the deeper areas of the bay. The size of the breach and channel is important for gaining development of full tidal exchange in the restoration site. The opening of the new tidal basin needs to be deeply excavated to remove the compacted material of the old original levee. One of the sites reviewed had a sill of compacted material that was not removed and thus restricted full tidal exchange. The breach should be sized to accommodate the estimated tidal prism for the restored site. The outer entrance channel would scour over time and adjust to this new ""˜back bay' tidal flow if the breach was large enough. 4. Using dredged mud to create an intertidal template could accelerate restoration of tidal marsh habitats. However, to develop and evolve an adequate channel system, the template elevation should not exceed 0.6 m NGVD. With these recommendations, the design for the Sonoma Baylands site was completed in 1991. The design consisted of several elements: 1. Construction of a new flood control levee with a crest elevation of +12 ft NGVD to accommodate the 100-year high tide storm surge event. The wetland side of the levee would have a 5:1 slope. The levee would protect adjacent low-lying lands and freeways from tidal inundation. A set of high voltage transmission towers would be enclosed in the new levee system as well. 2. Construction of a series of wave breaker peninsulas. These peninsulas were oriented to disperse summertime wave patterns. The arrangement of the peninsulas was determined after careful study of local patterns of wind speed and direction. The peninsulas would protect the levee from erosion and increase the sedimentation rates in the perimeter areas of the site. This feature would assist in the development of high marsh along the site perimeter. In the middle of the site closest to the entrance channel, there would be no peninsulas, to allow for greater wind scour and accommodate cordgrass habitat for a longer time. The peninsulas would only be needed for the first decade of the wetland development, when the site was largely open water at high tide. As the site filled in with natural sedimentation, elevations would increase. Vegetation would invade and break up the waves. The peninsulas would be built to the +4.0 ft NGVD elevation and would subside to the elevation of high marsh over time. 3. Placement of up to 2.5 million m3 of clean dredged mud from one of several local dredging projects to create a template at the +2.0 ft NGVD elevation. The levees and peninsulas were also located for facilitating the placement of dredged material. It was preferable to place all of the material in one construction cycle rather than small amounts over many years of construction. For this reason, only large channel deepening projects were reviewed as potential sources of material. The material would be kept wet the entire time it was on site to avoid oxidation and changes in pH. Using the dredged material would decrease the time for developing the marsh habitats by 20 - 40 years over natural sedimentation rates. Natural sedimentation rates for this area of the bay were calculated from measurements for a nearby marina. 4. Tidal flows would be restored by connecting to a natural outboard tidal slough channel. The tidal prism of the restored site would erode the entrance channel to a wider and deeper size over time. Natural erosion was preferable to dredging the entrance channel. 5. Monitoring needed to be a part of the project. A ""˜pilot' project of 16 ha isolated within the site by a utility levee was proposed to evaluate surveying, placement, and monitoring methods for the dredged material. The mud is hydraulically placed in slurry of up to 80% water. Special instruments are needed to determine when the maximum fill elevation of +2.0 ft. NGVD is achieved. Overfilling does not benefit the restoration project. A long-term monitoring program for the physical and biological performance of the site was also proposed. With the design completed and the project parameters set, the project needed institutional funding and political support for implementation (Marcus 2000).

Implementing the project (Marcus 2000):
As part of the design process, a restoration project that used dredge material and one that did not were both evaluated. Since the use of fill would accelerate the development of marsh habitats for the endangered species by several decades, this alternative was pursued. Sources of dredge material were evaluated according to the amount of material the project needed to achieve its ecological goals. 

Dredging controversy in the bay  -  During the 1980s, the Port of Oakland was in the midst of a battle with many interest groups over proposed sites for disposal of some 6.6 million m3 of clean dredged mud. Until acceptable sites were found, the Port could not proceed with an essential channel-deepening project to accommodate larger ships. As the debate over dredging wore on, shipping lines began to use other ports, and Oakland's share of the maritime market dwindled. The Corps of Engineers, which is primarily responsible for dredging in navigable waters, had proposed to dump the mud back into the Bay near Alcatraz Island. It had also proposed disposal in the nearshore ocean, near Half Moon Bay. Both proposals had evoked angry opposition from commercial and sport fishermen, environmentalists, and even bay swimmers. The Half Moon Bay Fishermen's Association won a court battle to protect its productive fishing grounds. By 1989, all sides in the conflict were embittered and angry, and no solution was in sight. Even before the design plan for the Baylands was completed, the Corps and the Port of Oakland began to inquire about the project and the concept of using dredged materials to restore a marsh. The design had concluded that the Baylands could use 2.0 - 2.5 million m3 of dredged mud. The exact quantity would depend upon the ratio of sands, which were larger and took up more room, to the smaller silts and clays. This amount of material was significant; the Baylands project could take over a third of the mud that was to be dredged from the Port of Oakland. Cost estimates for the placement of the fill were encouraging, showing that barging mud 42 km from the Port of Oakland to the Baylands site would be cost-competitive with barging mud to the most recently proposed deep ocean disposal site 70 miles offshore. The primary environmental issue remaining was to assure that all the material placed at the Baylands was clean and passed the rigorous ocean disposal testing. The environmental protection agency (EPA) and the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board oversee testing programs, assure the validity of test results, and determine the suitability of dredged materials for disposal. They base their conclusions on the results of chemical testing and the results of bioassay tests, which evaluate the toxicity of water and sediment from the dredged materials to various species of zooplankton. Only dredged material deemed suitable for aquatic disposal would be allowed at the Baylands. In addition, to make sure that chemicals from Oakland's material did not bioaccumulate in wetland plants and animals, the Corps grew these 380 plants and animals in the sediments for a year in a laboratory. Results of these tests showed no significant uptake and concentration of persistent chemicals, even for dredged materials that were not considered suitable for ocean disposal. These tests assured us that we would not be creating a problem that would appear many years from now. As a matter of fact, much of the dredged material was cleaner than the samples tested from the existing natural marshes near the Baylands site.

Legislative success  -  At a meeting in 1991 for all concerned elected officials, government entities, special interest groups, and the ports, Lauren Marcus presented the Baylands design and how to implement the project as a part of a dredging project. The response was surprising. The Bay Area Congressional delegation, federal and state regulatory agencies, environmental groups, and port authorities expressed support; the Corps of Engineers, however, was not encouraging and reminded everyone that it lacked specific congressional authorization to undertake the Baylands project. At this time, Corps policy did not favor wetland creation as an option for disposal of dredged mud. Bound by a tradition of aquatic disposal and a national policy to implement the cheapest alternative, the Corps was committed to a different philosophy. At this point, L. Marcus began a campaign to create a coalition of allies strong enough to persuade the Corps to shift away from its traditional policy. All parties who held an interest in dredging including organized labor, business and development, shipping lines, the individual ports, regulatory agencies, as well as congressional and state legislative staff were briefed. The goal was to convince them that the Baylands project was the key to resolve the dredging impasse and that their assistance was crucial. The overwhelming support for the project by environmental groups, especially the Save San Francisco Bay Association, Sierra Club, and Natural Heritage Institute, was a clear bargaining chip. These groups had successfully stopped the port of Oakland in its previous attempts at dredging and had steadfastly opposed aquatic disposal. The Port of Oakland cautiously endorsed the Baylands, unsure of how much it might cost, but very willing to help get its dredging project moving. Many different parties came to see the Baylands not just as a good compromise to get the port dredged, but as a good idea for reusing dredged material. Still, it would take an act of Congress to have the project implemented. In 1992, the bay dredging action coalition (BDAC), newly formed by community, business, and labor leaders to resolve the dredging crisis, made the Baylands a cornerstone of its political agenda. The coalition's letterhead listed shipping lines, banks, chambers of commerce, numerous trade unions, and others with an interest in seeing the Port of Oakland channel deepening proceed. The project now had the broad-based backing it needed. While environmental groups supported the project, it was largely this powerful coalition that pushed the Baylands through the system, helping the Bay Area Congressional delegation. In the 1992 Water Resources Development Act, Congress directed the Corps to build the Baylands project. Specifically, it instructed the Corps to complete final engineering designs, build the first stage of the project, including the levee and peninsulas, and place clean dredged material on the site for the purpose of restoring a wetland. The Congressional authorization also included a 20-year monitoring program and remediation of physical functions of the wetland if needed. In 1993, a major push was made to get the Corps begin the work authorized by Congress and have the Baylands ready on the same schedule as the Port of Oakland channel deepening project. The Corps agreed to proceed with the next steps in the process. 

Permitting problems and policy dilemmas  -  Just as the Corps had endorsed the project, a federal agency with responsibility for the protection and recovery of endangered species responded to the Baylands with a negative letter and recommended that the project permits be denied. The USFWS requested a number of additions to the project, the most controversial of which introduced the assumption that tidal marsh restoration required mitigation. Specifically, the Baylands hayfield retained low spots that ponded water in very wet years and thus created ""˜seasonal' wetlands. The Corps had determined that 23 ha of Section 404 jurisdictional wetlands existed on the site. The Corps and the other agencies involved had agreed that a fully tidal 138-ha wetland would provide such high value habitat that it would more than compensate for the loss of these occasionally ponded hayfields. But USFWS recommended that several hundred acres of seasonal wetlands be created as mitigation for restoration of the tidal wetlands. This was an expensive condition to accommodate, and it set a precedent that could eliminate other future restoration projects. Perhaps the most difficult part of this request was its timing. The USFWS had participated in the Baylands project for four years and had contributed to both the concept and the specific design. Why did it only now bring up such a fundamental issue? The other agencies, the EPA, the Regional Water Quality Control Board, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and even the Corps, stood firmly in opposition to the Service's contention that tidal restoration projects required mitigation. Environmental groups, however, were split into two camps by this new requirement. On one side were those who had fought ocean and bay dumping and saw the Baylands as an environmentally beneficial answer to the dredging dilemma. On the other were people passionately concerned about seasonal wetlands, fearful of future restoration projects. After many emotionally charged months of debate, a compromise was reached. Ten hectares of seasonally ponded area was added to the Baylands site. The area between the new levee and the old drainage ditch would be compacted and managed as a high-quality seasonal wetland. The other parcels of the site would also be restored to add to the seasonal wetland acreage. These concessions would not become permit conditions and therefore would not set a policy precedent for requiring mitigation for other wetland restoration projects. Finally, USFWS withdrew their opposition to the project. Economics and cost-sharing on the project was another subject of lengthy negotiation. Under the Corps system, the national economic development (NED) alternative, determines the cost-sharing on a project. In the case of the port's project, the Corps had determined that ocean disposal was the cheapest alternative, despite the distance of 120 km from the offshore site. The Baylands project was required to cost share 25% of the $1.5 million in site-improvement costs for the levee, peninsulas, and utility line changes. The Baylands was also required to cost share the ""˜""˜difference'' between the cost of bringing dredged material to this site and the cost of ocean disposal. This difference was estimated at $3.4 million. Overall the total cost for the Baylands including land acquisition and design was about $6 million, roughly a 5% increase in the overall $100 million estimate for the dredging project. 
Presidential endorsement for the project  -  In December 1993, President Clinton endorsed the Baylands project as a part of the Port of Oakland dredging effort. In the wake of large-scale military base closings, the Port of Oakland was seen as especially vital to the local economy. A White House task force was created to speed the Port dredging and the Baylands projects along. The negotiation of funding and cost share agreements and completion of all the plans and specifications for the project progressed quickly. Throughout all these stages, the ecological goals of the project were preserved; no additional filling or significant changes to the design were allowed.

Construction begins  -  Construction of the levee and peninsulas began in July 1994, following a dedication ceremony with Vice President Gore. The construction required 2 months. Dredging and placement operations from the Petaluma River channel began in
September 1994 and filled the 40-acre pilot project. This operation used resistivity probes to monitor slurry density and control the fill amounts and elevations. Dredging the river channel deepened the landing site for the barges from Oakland, allowing them to be filled with greater volumes of material and reducing unit costs while allowing the testing of the probes. The pilot unit was opened to tidal action in January 1996 after the material had consolidated. Placement of Oakland material began in May 1995 and proceeded smoothly. The resistivity probes worked well at determining fill elevations. Returning water from the site met all water quality requirements. The location of the probes and engineering specifications broke the site into cells where fill amounts were measured. This approach clearly retained the maximum fill elevations and protected the ecological integrity of the project. The main unit of the site was allowed to consolidate for months while the final monitoring plan was being completed. Tidal flow was restored to the site in October 1996.

Monitoring  -  Monitoring of the physical and biological aspects of the site began before opening the sites and will continue for the next 20 years. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Both units were opened to the tidal action of the Bay in 1996, beginning the process of natural marsh formation.  The Sonoma Baylands project began attracting large numbers of shorebirds and waterfowl even before the restoration of tidal action.  Marcus (2000) reported shorebird use was already very high and cordgrass and pickleweed had established at the site through natural colonization.  The tidal channels that connect the project to the open waters of the Bay have gradually expanded, increasing the range of tidal action and the amount of sediment deposition in the restoration area.  Salt marsh vegetation quickly colonized the entire perimeter of the restoration area and is gradually expanding further toward the center of the site as additional sediment is naturally deposited over the dredged material.  The site continues to provide a feeding and resting area for large numbers of shorebirds and waterfowl as development of the young marsh continues to progress (CCA 2008). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Two major transportation corridors, a highway and a railroad, cross through the property, separating it into three ""˜parcels' (Marcus 2000).

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The Sonoma Baylands Project allowed for the easing of a dredging controversy in the bay providing a direct economic benefit as the use of the Port of Oakland had been dwindling.  An additional benefit accrued by creating a 300-acre tidal wetland with significant environmental value (Marcus 2000). Passive recreation values also have stemmed from the project with a later trail project aiming to enhance such opportunities while also conserving wildlife habitat (Gandesbery 2003).
The Sonoma Baylands is more than just a tidal restoration project or a creative answer to a port’s dredging problem. It represents an ideal case “” the transformation of a situation in which animosity and conflict dominate to a peaceful and beneficial settlement “”backed by a successful political coalition. In California, where divisions are often stronger than alliances, the Baylands is a unique victory, demonstrating the ability of people with diverse viewpoints to agree, cooperate, and accomplish great things together. It is also important to note that the Baylands began not as a government-mandated program or policy directive, but as the vision of several people. It became a reality through the hard work of many people in government and private organizations, all of whom were ready to embrace a new and useful idea and to combine efforts to achieve its implementation. The Baylands project was always managed as a collaborative effort with many supporters (Marcus 2000).
The Baylands is also a fine example of integrating the knowledge from past restoration efforts to create a new and better-informed approach. Once defined, the ecological goals were retained in all aspects of the project from design and engineering to construction and monitoring. At no time did the project change from marsh restoration to dredged material disposal. The inclusion of a large-scale marsh restoration in an industrial port dredging project has opened the door for other similar projects nationwide. When evaluated only as a dredged material disposal site, the Baylands costs slightly more (5%) than disposal at the newly designated ocean site 70 miles offshore. However, this economic evaluation does not account for the value of creating a 300-acre tidal wetland. When the value of the habitat is included, the Baylands was the clear bargain compared to aquatic disposal, which produces no environmental benefits (Marcus 2000). The success of the Sonoma Baylands project has provided the basis for a continuing and productive partnership between the California State Coastal Conservancy and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Conservancy, Corps and cooperating stakeholders are currently pursuing several other larger restoration projects in San Francisco Bay (CCA 2008).
Largely in response to the Baylands project, the long-term management strategy (LTMS), a multiagency planning effort for disposal of material dredged from San Francisco Bay, includes wetland creation as a regulatory alternative. The LTMS agencies, the EPA, the Regional Water Quality Control Board, the Corps, and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, have all endorsed the concept of reuse of dredged material. The LTMS proposes to set a policy that 40% of all dredged material in the bay go to sites such as the Baylands. It is important to note that the Sonoma Baylands was first and foremost a wetland restoration development project. Its planning, design, and construction followed ecological goals established without reference to dredging projects or fulfilling policy concepts. The decision to use dredged material at the Baylands was made after a thorough evaluation of the site and the potential benefits of using fill to accelerate wetland development. Not all restoration sites will necessarily benefit from using dredged material. The Baylands project was realized through the collaboration of many parties. The LTMS proposal seeks to regulate the dredging community to institute Baylands-like solutions. There is a fundamental difference in approach between a collaborative development and a regulatory directive. A collaborative approach is far more likely to be successful. The LTMS agencies in implementing their policy directives need to establish sound ecological goals for restoration, and a collaborative approach with the maritime industry and ports (Marcus 2000). The Corps was directed in the 1992 legislation to complete long-term monitoring (20 years) and remediation of physical functions of the wetland if needed. The Corps and Coastal Conservancy are continuing to closely monitor the development of the marsh (CCA 2008). Physical change, such as the erosion of the outboard entrance channel, development of tidal range, development of channel morphology, colonization by vegetation, and use by bird, fish and invertebrate species, is being recorded (Marcus 2000).

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-california-restoration-research-at-red-rock-canyon-state-park/	USA: California: Restoration Research at Red Rock Canyon State Park	United States of America	19910331	20000331	"Red Rock Canyon officially became part of the State Park system in 1968. In 1989, 4000 acres were added to the park in a land transfer with the Bureau of Land Management. The South Flat area was included in these lands, and up until the land transfer had been heavily used by OHVs as a campground with large motor homes, a racetrack and a play area for 4WD vehicles and motorcycles. The State Park staff closed the area in 1989 and fenced the area off preventing further OHV activity. The Soil Ecology and Restoration Group (SERG) at San Diego State University (SDSU) began work at the site in 1991, and native species planting began in 1993.Our efforts for this project were originally focused on the recovery of native annual species, which have been extremely slow to reappear in the more disturbed areas of the South Flat. Desert annuals in the Mojave are an important food source for the endangered desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) and other desert wildlife. Our initial objectives were also to evaluate micro-nutrient availability and mycorrhizal activity along a disturbance gradient and to use these findings to create a restoration scheme that would enhance the establishment of desert annuals.Since Red Rock Canyon State Park had experienced two consecutive dry seasons since 1997 due to the La Niña effect, we were unable to collect adequate annual seed for a field or greenhouse experiment. Thus the scope of the project was modified to continue revegetating the South Flat area with perennials. Seven hundred seedlings were grown from local seed in SERG greenhouses. Five hundred of the seedlings were planted at South flat in March 2000.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Until it was added to Red Rock Canyon State Park in 1989, the South Flat area had been heavily used by off-higway vehicles (OHVs) as a campground with large motor homes, a racetrack and a play area for 4WD vehicles and motorcycles. The State Park staff closed the area in 1989 and fenced the area off, preventing further OHV activity. OHV use produces a damaging effect upon vegetation, and plant rehabilitation efforts often are marginally successful or unsuccessful.Â  An investigation of plant cover loss at OHV use-areas has been found to range from 23% at the location of a one-time OHV event to upwards of 91% and 96% in areas of concentrated vehicle use.Â  Various studies point out that even a single pass by a four-wheel drive vehicle will reduce plant density and outright destroy small-sized plants.Â Red Rock Canyon State Park is characterized by a diversity of desert floral communities and landform features and contains six natural wildlife habitat types, including a biologically critical riparian zone in Last Chance Canyon and within Red Rock Wash. Red Rock Canyon SP is home to a number of sensitive animal and plant species, including the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizi), Mohave ground squirrel (Spermophilus mojavensis), Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus), Townsend’s big-eared bat (Corynorhinus [Plecotus] townsendii), Spotted bat (Euderma maculatum), Red Rock tarplant (Deinandra arida), Red Rock poppy (Eschscholzia minutiflora ssp. Twisselmannii), Charlotte’s phacelia (Phacelia nashiana), Mohave fish-hook cactus (Sclerocactus polyancistrus), creosote clone rings, various unique terrestrial invertebrates, and many others.Â  Some species, most notably the Red Rock tarplant, are endemic to the park.Â  Habitat for these plant and animal species often occur along the main routes of travel in the park. The primary research aim of SERG has been to develop cost efficient restoration methods through various site treatments and revegetation procedures. Efforts for this project were originally focused on the recovery of native annual species, which have been extremely slow to reappear in the more disturbed areas of the South Flat. Since Red Rock Canyon State Park had experienced two consecutive dry seasons since 1997 due to the La Niña effect, it was not possible to collect adequate annual seed for a field or greenhouse experiment. Thus the scope of the project was modified to continue revegetating the South Flat area with perennials.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
This study was performed by the Soil Ecology and Restoration Group (SERG) at San Diego State University (SDSU). SERG began work at the site in 1991. Red Rock Canyon State Park is administered by the California Department of Parks and Recreation.

Description of Project Activities: Soil Sampling ""¨

Soil samples were collected on 12-13 March 1999, 14-15 April 1999 and on 18 March 2000. Samples were collected on three 30 meter transects along a selected disturbance gradient of less disturbed, moderately disturbed and very disturbed soils. Six samples were taken per transect. Soils were analyzed for available nitrate, phosphorus, total nitrogen, pH, organic matter and micro-nutrients.

Available nitrogen was slightly higher in the very disturbed than in the undisturbed and disturbed areas. The higher levels in the relatively undisturbed area were higher than might be expected and may reflect deposition of nutrient rich litter and dust.

Phosphorus levels were high but within previously observed levels. The very disturbed areas also had considerable available phosphorus. This has been observed before and probably results from vehicle oil leaks and detergents used by large camps. 
Desert soil is generally alkaline so the pH results were typical except for the very disturbed area, which was lower than the others. This probably reflects the effects of erosion, with wind blowing away fine calcium particles.
Organic matter levels were typical for desert soils, ranging from 0.7-1.1 percent. The highest levels ever measured at RRCSP were under desert Senna at 2.2%.
For minor nutrients, only potassium, zinc, and possibly boron currently demonstrate a distinct trend, increasing as the disturbance becomes greater. Zinc and boron are probably the result of vehicle operation, with runoff from galvanized materials, gasoline, oils and greases. A fire pit at the south flat measured during an earlier project had 60 ppm zinc, many times higher than the levels observed here. The higher levels of magnesium in the very disturbed site are again probably related to vehicle operation and fires.

Seed Collection and Germination ""¨
Seeds from native perennials and several native annuals were collected on 13-14 March 1999 and 15-16 July 1999 from the South Flat and surrounding areas within Red Rock Canyon State Park. Five hundred native seedlings were grown from this seed in the SERG greenhouse at San Diego State University. Seeds were germinated in flats that were misted twice daily. Once seeds had germinated, seedlings were transplanted into 2x8 inch plant bands and misted 3 times per week. Once established, plants received water on a weekly basis. One month before planting, plants were watered every 10-14 days. The soil mixture was one part organic matter/one part perlite/one part sand.
Revegetation Planting
Plants were placed in the numerous bare areas of the South Flat. Planting occurred on 11-12 and 17-18 March 2000. Planting holes were dug using a power auger and were saturated with water before and after planting. All plants were provided with tree-pees, plastic plant protectors 15-20 cm tall, to reduce herbivory and provide protection from the wind and blowing sand. Watering basins were constructed for each plant.
For the test study, 30 plants (10 Atriplex polycarpa, 10 Isomeris arborea, and 10 Senna armata) were planted along each of the three disturbance transects for a total of 90 plants. Plants were randomly treated with one of the following amendments: fertilizer alone (13-13-13 slow release), fertilizer and microfertilizer (13-13-13 and Azomite), fertilizer and mulch (13-13-13 and cocoa mulch) or no amendments. These plants were also provided with treepees and height was measured for each individual after planting.
Supplemental watering occurred on a monthly basis, unless enough natural precipitation had occurred, beginning in April 2000.  Water was mechanically pumped into containers and plants were hand watered. Each plant received approximately 1/2 gallon of water at each watering. Total amount per plant over the year was about 6 gallons, plus natural precipitation.
On 23 September percent plant survival was measured for total plants and for the experimental plots. Plant basins were reconstructed on an as-needed basis and missing plant protectors that had been blown off were located and replaced. 

Overall survival was 56% with Atriplex polycarpa having the highest survival at 87%. The lowest survival rate seen was for Senna armata at 39%.  Survival at the experimental plots was 55%. Not enough data is available at this time to determine if there is a significant difference between treatments. Of the three species used in the experiments, Atriplex polycarpa did significantly better than Senna armata and Isomeris arborea. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The overall survival rate of 56% is slightly better than most previous restoration projects that have been conducted at Red Rock Canyon State Park, especially since planting occurred in the middle of a two year drought period.  The experimental plot survival rate at South Flat of 55% after six months is also slightly better than most desert restoration projects. The saltbush, Atriplex polycarpa, survived better than the other two species at 83%. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The lack of annual seed due to low rainfall in 1998 and 1999 changed the scope of this project. Revegetating with shrubs became the primary goal, with soil analysis and treatment methods being studied to improve methods used in desert restoration of native perennial species.

When there is little or no rain, the effect of soil amendments is particularly slow to manifest itself because water is necessary for soil microbial actions to occur. It is expected that soil amendment effects may begin to appear in the future, but only if there is sufficient precipitation during the winter months to activate the below ground processes.
OHV and other human disturbances that occur in desert environments may take hundreds of years to recover without active intervention and restoration efforts. SERG has been successful in the South Flat area through a variety of soil and planting treatments. These restoration efforts, coupled with the restriction of OHV activity, has greatly increased the probability of habitat recovery in the South Flat area.
That the two saltbushes, Atriplex polycarpa and A. canescens, had higher survival rates than the other species is to be expected. Saltbush is a very hardy plant that has done well in all our previous Mojave Desert restoration projects, especially on highly impacted soils. The survival rates for the other species are also about average when compared to previous projects in similar habitats. Past experience has shown us that A. polycarpa is an excellent restoration species to use for heavily disturbed areas in the Mojave Desert. It normally has a high initial survival rate and demonstrates quick and heavy growth with minimal water.
Isomeris arborea, though low initial survival rates are common, is also an excellent restoration species. It suffers little from herbivory, being extremely unappetizing to most desert herbivores, and is a prolific producer of seed. As such, it produces many new seedlings through natural recruitment. Once established, it is a fast grower, quickly producing much needed cover and food for wildlife. Hummingbirds have often been found enjoying the flowers of Isomeris on the south flat. The low survival of Senna armata was expected, this species is susceptible to a number of pathogens and is not often found in great numbers.
Several factors from the initial soil sampling data are of interest. First, there are indications that the soil remains adversely affected by the OHV disturbance and camping at the South Flat, even though it has been closed to off-highway vehicle activity for over ten years. Both vehicle operation and camping apparently leave long lasting legacies in changed soil properties. Impacts to desert soils do not quickly heal themselves. The second concerns pH. Desert soils are usually slightly alkaline, having a pH normally above 7.0. Initial results show that soil pH decreases as the amount of disturbance increases. The third item of interest is the apparent increase in zinc and boron as the amount of disturbance increases. All soil samples were within previously observed levels and pose little concern for plant growth, although the elevated levels of boron are approaching the point where they may impact sensitive plants. Proper micro-nutrient availability is important to the growth and survival of all plants and the higher levels of zinc may in fact prove helpful. The lower pH in areas of increased disturbance should also increase micro-nutrient availability and make conditions better for plant establishment. The limiting factor appears to be the changes in soil structure, not nutrients, although the availability of nutrients may be different than the absolute levels. Not enough information is available in such a short time to make any type of judgement concerning the effects of micro-nutrients on plant growth and survival. We will continue monitoring to see what happens in the future. The area will remain closed to OHV use. Vegetation will be monitored and survival and growth over time will be analyzed to determine the effects of differing soil amendments and micronutrient availability. "

This project has been working on ecological restoration activities to achieve the consolidation of a local biological corridor in the northern Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. The goal of this project is the recovery of degraded and damaged ecosystems as well as the replacement of ecosystems that were entirely destroyed. The Nogal-La Selva local Biological Corridor (NSBC) is located in Sarapiquí, in the northern Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica, Central America. The NSBC is an effort which intends to connect forest fragments from the Nogal Private Wildlife Refuge (252 acres), a natural private reserve owned by Chiquita Brands International, to La Selva Biological Station (3,900 acres), an ecological research station owned by the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS). La Selva Biological Station is also linked with Braulio Carrillo National Park (117, 527 acres) one of the largest and one of the most important public protected areas in Costa Rica. The NSBC is also part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, one of the largest bioregional conservation programs in the world that is seeking to consolidate biological corridors from the southern Mexican states to Panama.Ecological, economic, aesthetic, educational, and scientific benefits all accrue from the ecological restoration of the project area. The project has been an important learning process regarding the restoration methods used, the monitoring methods and the community involvement. This project can be considered a model for future efforts in the Caribbean slope of Costa Rica and in other countries because of its relatively low costs and its potential for a social impact regarding environmental protection. This effort has entailed the temporary employment of local people, especially young adults, some of them are high school students who attend school at night. Thus an ecological restoration project has played a complementary role in the income of the people of a rural village. Monitoring of the NSBC is ongoing and relationships have been established between numerous scientiï¬c and environmental organizations to deï¬ne various future research projects.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation, Other The NSBC is located in an agricultural landscape of mostly banana plantations, plantain plantations, hearts of palm plantations, cattle raising farms and human settlements. Other important economic activities in the region are ecotourism, pineapple plantations and timber plantations. Sixteen restoration areas were identified within those properties, the areas were identified by the need for ecological restoration and because of the strategic position to develop linkages such as distance between forest fragments, shape, and other characteristics of the fragments. The previous land uses and/or disturbances to these restoration areas were the following: banana plantations; abandoned banana plantations areas already possessing secondary growth; cattle raising pastures; an area where the superficial soil layers were completely removed to be used to build a dike (the area had problems of erosion and severely compacted soils); protected areas (within the Nogal Private Wildlife Refuge) that were affected by floods from a river, Río Sucio – since these areas are bordered by a dike the flood waters remained much longer than the usual causing many trees to die and fall down fostering the colonization of invasive plants (including exotic invasive species such as Musa velutina) and also the edge effect in the remaining forests – the main stressor in these areas is therefore the floodings from the river; areas adjacent to a secondary road and along a dike where the deforestation and the work of trucks have damaged and compacted the soils. It is important to note that the main stressor of these areas is either the direct or indirect effects of flooding or its implications of anoxic conditions in the substrate. The region has a flat topography of mostly alluvial lowlands with undulating terrain in some areas. The annual rainfall is around 3712 mm to 4000 mm with peaks in December/January and June/July. The average temperature is 25.8 ÂºC and the area is considered a Tropical Wet Forest according to the Holdridge Life Zone system. The soils are mostly Inceptisols and Ultisols with the former predominating near the Río Sucio margins.
Braulio Carrillo National Park extends down to La Selva through a forest corridor that descends in elevation from 2,906 meters at Volcán Barva to 35 meters above sea level at La Selva. This reserve, consisting of both La Selva’s protected environs and the Park, has four major tropical life zones and includes more than 5,000 species of vascular plants, of which more than 700 species are trees. The fauna is similarly diverse. Large predators include jaguars, pumas, and bushmasters. Thousands of arthropod species are being currently recorded at La Selva, and more than 400 species of resident and migratory birds have been sighted in the reserve, representing almost half of Costa Rica’s bird species. The project intends to connect forest fragments from the Nogal Private Wildlife Refuge, a natural private reserve owned by Chiquita Brands International, to La Selva Biological Station, an ecological research station owned by the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS). The main restoration goals of this project are the recovery of degraded and damaged ecosystems as well as the replacement of ecosystems that were entirely destroyed.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
In 2004 the Nature and Community Project (NCP), an effort between Chiquita Brands International, MIGROS (a swiss retailer), GTZ (German cooperation agency) and Rainforest Alliance was initiated. This project has been working on ecological restoration activities to achieve the consolidation of a local biological corridor in the northern Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. The NCP visited each landowner to make a proposal to develop ecological restoration activities within their properties. The most “official” agreement was made with the Monge Leon cattle raising family, a family that has owned a 300 ha (741 acres) farm for over 30 years, the linkage that goes through this property is the largest (4.5 ha = 11.5 acres). Taking into account that there is no legal mechanism to make biological corridors in the Costa Rica’s environmental laws the NCP decided to create an “honor” agreement between Chiquita and the family’s cattle raising company. Ten properties were identified to be used for ecological restoration, including a property owned by Chiquita brands International (where the Nogal Private Wildlife Refuge is located).

Description of Project Activities: To propose and develop the NSBC through ecological restoration, the Nature and Community Project (NCP) has evaluated the landscape by using satellite photographs, a cartographic sheet and systematic field observations. As a result of analyzing the mentioned sources the NCP identified the key sites to develop physical linkages between the major forest fragments through ecological restoration activities. It is important to note that even though the objective of the NCP is to consolidate physical linkages between forest fragments through ecological restoration, primates are considered a focal group. Primates were chosen as the focal group after the results of a research study. The study analyzed monkey populations, Howler Monkeys (Alouatta palliata) and White-faced Capuchin Monkeys (Cebus capucinus), in order to explore future viability under different scenarios. The study found evidence to support greater viability for primate populations under a fully developed biological corridor fusing both forest fragments. It also found that if the refuge's two forest fragments would have been left separated from each other the monkey populations of both monkey species would not have been feasible within 16 to over 30 years. After identifying the key properties necessary to create the linkages through ecological restoration, the project identified ten small and large landowners. Thus the NCP visited each landowner to make a proposal to develop ecological restoration activities within their properties. The most ""official"" agreement was made for the Monge Leon cattle raising family, a family that has owned a 300 ha (741 acres) farm for over 30 years, the linkage that goes through this property is the largest (4.5 ha = 11.5 acres). Taking into account that there is no legal mechanism to make biological corridors in the Costa Rica's environmental laws the NCP decided to make an ""honour"" agreement between Chiquita and the family's cattle raising company. Ten properties were identified to be used for ecological restoration, including a property owned by Chiquita brands International (where the Nogal Private Wildlife Refuge is located). Sixteen restoration areas were identified within those properties, the areas were identified by the need for ecological restoration and because of the strategic position to develop linkages such as distance between forest fragments, shape, and other characteristics of the fragments.  As a result of the negative impacts to the areas project leaders identified the needs for ecological restoration. The management plan for the Nogal Private Wildlife Refuge (Nogal PWR) included within its management programs to ensure the long term conservation of the reserve, the creation of biological corridors and reforestation of surrounding areas.  

To achieve the restoration and landscape connectivity goals the methods to manipulate the biotic and abiotic components were determined and written down in a protocol. This restoration protocol has all the methods performed by the project and has been under updating as more new methods have been practiced. The main interventions made in order to prepare the restoration areas and the maintenance activities are indicated as following: 

 - Selection of tree species for reforestation: 46 native species were first selected between the years 2004 and 2005 for the reforestation. In the following years more species have been added to reach a total of 56 native species (to the region of the country). The following seven species are considered threatened: Jícaro (Lecythis ampla), Corteza (Tabebuia guayacan), Targuayugo (Dussia macroprophyllata), Cedro (Cedrela odorata), Manú (Minquartia guianensis), Campano (Sacoglottis trichogyna) and Almendro (Dipteryx panamensis). The main propagation methods used are seeds. To mark each tree planted a cane pole of Gynerium sagittatum was used, which is actually one of the dominant grass species in target for control. Poles were marked with different colored ribbons to identify monitored trees.

 - Drainages: as the flooding of the local river basin affects the trees planted the PNC made drainages in critical parts where the most intense flooding occurs. This part is in one of the forest fragments of the Nogal PWR. Other smaller drainages were made in other reforestation areas that were prone to floodings (partly because of the damaged soil conditions). 

 - Soil mixing: in one area (area 6) the soil was significantly damaged by exploitation, erosion and compaction. Thus minimal soil mixing was done by using a truck with subsoiler, and then the soil was mixed with chicken manure. 

 - Holes for trees and tree spacing: holes of different dimensions were dug according to the condition of the soils. For normal soil conditions holes of 15-22 cm deep and 10 cm diameter were dug. For compacted soil conditions holes of the following dimensions were made: 45 cm x 25 cm in the latter case organic fertilizer (chicken manure) was applied at the bottom of each hole. As this plantation was for ecological restoration purposes trees were not planted at equal distances. Different spacing distances were used: 3 m x 3 m, 3.5 m x 3.5 m, 3 m x 4 m, 4 m x 5 to 5 m x 5 m. For all the restoration areas a random species distribution was set.

 - Elimination of weeds: the main dominant weed species competing with the planted trees are mostly three: Gamalote grass (Paspalum sp.), Velvet Pink Banana (Musa velutina) and Caña brava (Gynerium sagittatum). The second is an exotic invasive species native to Vietnam. The first species, Paspalum sp., is by far the most dominant, so in order to take a more efficient control a herbicide (RoundupÂ® by Monsanto) was used, but only in areas without any slope or near water sources to avoid contamination. 

 - Fencing: in restoring cattle farms, fencing is vital to protect trees from the livestock damage. As part of the restoration protocol the PNC installs both dead fences (wood poles) of Gavilán (Pentaclethra macroloba) tree wood and live fences of Poró tree (Erythrina spp.), for the latter cuttings were used as propagation method. In the cattle raising family's farm three fence gates were made along the linkage so that they can move the livestock from one side of the farm to the other without having the risk of the animals entering the reforestation areas.

 - Relocation of electrical cables: considering that the Nogal PWR was divided into two separated forest fragments there was a need to link them especially for the viability of primate populations. However the main problem for connectivity was the location of the electric wires that were serving as a functional barrier for the linkages. The NCP decided to pay for the movement and relocation of the wires approximately 100 m away from the former site so that the trees can be planted without the need of having them heavily pruned in the future.

 - Soil management with fertilizers and dolomitic lime: as a result of soil analysis interpretation, for every main area organic and inorganic fertilizers were used to manage soil conditions. Soil analyses were made by the Costa Rican National University's (UNA) Institute of Forestry Services and Research (INISEFOR) and the National Banana Corporation (CORBANA). The products used include: 10-30-10 fertilizer and two organic fertilizers made of chicken manure, and of mule manure and banana waste. Dolomitic lime was used in the most critical areas. 

 - Selective pruning and thinning of preexisting vegetation: some of the abandoned banana plantations which had secondary growth with many ephimeral heliophyte species such as: Lengua de vaca (Conostegia xalapensis), Balsa (Ochroma pyramidale), Guarumo (Cecropia obtusifolia), among others. Pruning and thinning was necessary to eliminate competition and increase growth rate of the planted species (long-lived heliophyte species).  

 - Site clearing: the basic site preparation and maintenance in all the restoration areas consists basically of manual clearings by using a machete which was generally cutting and clearing all the grasses and weeds in the reforested area, but leaving some ecologically important species (see next point). The maintenance clearings involve clearing the weeds in a radius of 1 m around each tree planted. 

 - Passive restoration: for all the restoration areas the project workers left the growth of certain herbs, shrubs and tree species that are vital in tropical ecosystems. That was done when they had no interference with the growth of the planted trees. Those species were mostly of the following families: piperaceae, cecropiaceae, asteraceae, fabaceae, tiliaceae, bombacaceae, anacardiaceae, among others. These species are of special importance for animal pollinators and dispersers such as bats, birds, moths and other insects. For two restoration areas plots for natural regeneration were determined (one of 2,500 sq. m and the other of 5,380 sq. m) and marked so that in the future growth can be compared between passive and active management. 

 - Edge effect management: areas along the Nogal PWR perimeter in the forest edge were managed by clearing selected vine species (that were growing over large trees) and eliminating exotic herbs such as the Velvet Pink Banana (Musa velutina) and other preexisting vegetation. 

Monitoring of the reforestation has been performed every three months since the initial planting. Ten percent of all the planted trees are monitored.  The sampled trees were selected in a zigzag route throughout each reforestation area, only in area 9 selection occurred with a sample of 10% per species of tree planted. The following measurements and observations are carried out in each monitoring session: height, diameter and observations focusing on the general health condition of each tree monitored. As trees grow considerably fast in the tropics, measurement methods needed to be changed in the course of the monitoring activities. For height measurements metric tapes were being used but as trees grew up quickly a telescopic metre (for trees taller than 2 m) and a Haga altimeter (for trees taller than 9 m) were used. For diameter measurements the project crew used a Caliper (0-150 mm) initially and then a diameter tape to measure DBH. Of the number of trees planted in monitored restoration areas (10,713), 9.36% of them were sampled. The total number of trees planted by the project was 15,846. The rest of the trees (5,143 trees) were planted in non-monitored restoration areas that are under proper maintenance procedures. Height measurements were taken from the very base of the tree to the base of the upper bud at the tree top of the tree. The measurements with the Caliper were taken at the base of the tree but as the trees grew in width DBH (1.3 m) measurements needed to be taken with a diameter tape. The measurements are taken by people from the community and three maintenance employees of the Nogal PWR that were previously trained. Supervision of the activities, tree health condition observations, and also measurement taking was also performed by a forestry engineer and a technician in forestry and wildlife management. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The results and the restored areas show by themselves an evident progress towards ecological restoration. The total number of trees planted by the NCP in 20 restoration areas was 15,846 although the monitoring was only done in 16 restoration areas. The total number of trees monitored is 1,484 (9.36%). The growth of tree species varies but the average growth rate for trees of all the restoration areas is remarkable but not unexpected for the lowland humid tropics of Costa Rica. It's important to note that the growth rate of area 9 (which was previously a cattle pasture) is even higher than area 3.2, an area located inside the Nogal PWR, although the latter is occasionally affected by flooding. Abandoned banana plantations (areas 4, 4.2 and 7.2) also show a high growth rate probably because of the nutrients left by the agricultural activities and/or the organic matter developed through the succession process after the abandonment of the plantations. Area 8 showed the highest growth rate, and curiously the highest mortality rate, the area was previously an abandoned pasture in a sloppy and well drained area. Most of the restoration areas have individuals (trees) with diameters ranging from 0 to 60 mm. Area 7.1a & b has the most trees with diameters ranging between 100 mm to 120 mm. The majority of trees where DBH was measured have diameters ranging form 0 to 20 cm. The competition between the planted trees and the preexisting vegetation appears to have forced the trees to grow both in height and width. Also pruning and thinning activities of the preexisting vegetation have encouraged the growth rate. The total mortality rate of all the trees monitored (n = 1,484) was 13.48%. The mortality rate was higher for areas 4 and 8 mostly because of damages caused by animals and competition with vegetation. In these areas the mortality rate exceeded 20% under which mortality is considered very high in tree plantations. The trees in the area 4 were heavily attacked by Leaf cutter ants (Atta sp.) just right after the initial plantation of the trees. Another reason that explains the high mortality rate in this area was the quality of the saplings (size of the saplings and the substrate quality), since the project bought the genetic material and it was not produced by the project's tree nursery.  The main causes of mortality have been the following: damages by White-tailed deers (Odocoileus virginianus) and cows, competition by weeds and vegetation, planting trees that were too short (less than 19 cm in height), accidental cutting of the trees when clearing the sites for maintenance, damages by Stingless bees, Leaf cutter ants and attacks by Shoot-borer moth larvae Hypsipilla, and nutrient deficient soils. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: There are only two officially protected areas in the NSBC, Nogal Private Wildlife Refuge (102 ha = 252 acres) and La Selva Biological Station (1,600 ha = 3,900 acres) which are respectively located at the northern and southern borders of the corridor. There are two other large important forest fragments within the corridor that are not being officially protected. The NSBC is also located in a working agricultural landscape of banana, plantain, and hearts of palm plantations, cattle raising farms and human settlements. Other important economic activities in the region are ecotourism, pineapple plantations and timber plantations. There are six communities that rely on the land which exist within the corridor: Nogal-Guayacán, Caño Negro, El Palmar, La Flamínea, El Tigre y La Trinidad. Flooding of the stream basin can affect recovery. As the flooding of the local basin affects the trees planted the PNC made drainages in critical parts where the most intense flooding occurs. Other smaller drainages were made in other reforestation areas that were prone to flooding (partly because of the damaged soil conditions).

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The management plan for the Nogal Private Wildlife Refuge (Nogal PWR) included within its management programs to ensure the long term conservation of the reserve, the creation of biological corridors and reforestation of surrounding areas. Therefore the following benefits for the ecological restoration activities were identified: 

 - Ecological benefits: creation of a local biological corridor to conserve biodiversity in the long term; the environmental services given by these reforested areas: oxygen production, carbon dioxide fixation, hydric resources protection, etc. At least 76% of the tree species planted have known benefits for wildlife mostly as food sources and refuge.

 - Economic benefits: the biological corridor has the advantage of being potentially important for the ecotourism industry as well as for environmental payment services if the current system is changed in the future.

 - Aesthetic benefits: a reforested and linked landscape with all its wildlife is more pleasant and beautiful than a landscape where degradation and destructive land uses prevail.

 - Educational purposes: there is a strong component of environmental education in the region which is being achieved by the local commission of natural resources (CRENASA) an initiative that groups the main conservation organizations in the region (including the NCP). The NSBC is a great effort to educate and encourage future generations through field educational trips to the linkages and so on.

 - Scientific benefits: by trying to link a biological corridor to one of the world's most famous tropical ecological research centres and through an alliance with OTS the NCP is encouraging the biological monitoring of the corridor by experts from La Selva Biological Station. The ecological restoration efforts also provide impetus to other restoration efforts in the region.
The results and the restored areas show by themselves an evident progress towards ecological restoration. Although the restoration effort was not meant to have a fully scientific approach it is a relatively simple and sensible effort based on technical and scientific knowledge. It is also an important contribution to the local conservation efforts in Sarapiquí, Costa Rica. This effort has been an important learning process regarding the restoration methods used, the monitoring methods and the community involvement. There is a gap when it comes to ecological restoration in the Neotropics that needs to be addressed by conservationists and land managers. This project can be considered a model for future efforts in the Caribbean slope of Costa Rica and in other countries because of its relatively low costs and its potential for a social impact regarding environmental protection. Some of those trees species are not considered of commercial importance as they are not timber species giving to this effort a surplus value in the use of “unknown” native tree species for ecological restoration purposes. Soil chemical analysis and data gathered with the monitorings have been crucial to understanding growth dynamics, mortality, and factors affecting the planted trees in a very simple and matter-of-fact way. This effort also entailed the temporary employment of local people, especially young adults, some of them are high school students who attend school at night. Thus an ecological restoration project has played a complementary role in the income of the people of a rural village.
Some recommendations based on the experiences gathered during the course of this project are of significant relevance to this and other efforts:
– Trying to consolidate linkages in the landscape through ecological restoration (with the use of native species) and with the support of companies and local people can have an interesting and relevant impact that needs to be considered for land managers and conservationists.
– Ecological restoration methods such as vegetation and soil management and continuous maintenance rather than only tree planting are a must when trying to restore tropical degraded ecosystems in an agricultural landscape.
– The maintenance routines (site clearing, fertilizing, and so on) are also necessary for the development of the restored ecosystem and to guarantee sufficient resilience of the restored ecosystem in a shorter term.
– Passive restoration is very important to let ecological processes happen, considering that these processes are very dynamic and complex in tropical ecosystems. In some areas it is important to allow the growth of some herb, shrub and trees species even in the same active managed areas but bearing in mind that such vegetation might need some management to ensure that they do not interfere with the planted trees that may have a special long term importance for the ecosystem.
– The management of edge effect in tropical rainforests may have a very relevant role in ecological restoration in the future so these activities must be continued to produce some experience. But more research on this topic will be of special interest for forestry ecologists.
– It is important to train the field work staff in order to develop motivation and commitment as well as precise data. The standardization of monitoring methods needs to be well considered before the start of any restoration project.
– For the reforestation monitoring it is recommended that the standardization and the use of a bigger sample size per species and for each restoration area. Such things need to be considered before the start of the project. Monitoring of the NSBC is ongoing and relationships have been established between numerous scientiï¬c and environmental organizations to deï¬ne various future research projects. They include a detailed study of the monkey population in the area to determine their long-term viability and a study of how plants and wildlife are affected by annual ï¬‚oods. Another study will assess which environment wildlife prefers – induced reforestation or natural regeneration – to determine which method should be used to restore other areas.
Planting native trees within the degraded areas may have an additive affect on natural regeneration of forest areas via natural mechanisms. Researchers found that plantations of native species at La Selva Biological Station (Costa Rica) were effective in attracting seed dispersal agents from nearby forest patches, thus facilitating regeneration of degraded pasturelands. To facilitate long term conservation the management plan for the Nogal Private Wildlife Refuge (Nogal PWR) included the creation of biological corridors and reforestation of surrounding areas. "

The Iraqi Marshlands are a crucial part of intercontinental flyways for migratory birds, support endangered species, and sustain freshwater fisheries, as well as the marine ecosystem of the Persian Gulf. In addition to their ecological importance, these Marshlands are unique from the global perspective of human heritage. The area’s natural beauty is thought to have been the inspiration for the Bible’s description of the Garden of Eden and have been home to indigenous communities for millennia.Satellite images of the Marshlands in the early-mid-1970’s showed around 20,000 square kilometers of water surface and wetland vegetation (although diversion of flow has been ongoing through human history in the region especially following the 1950’s). In one generation, the marsh area shrank to a tenth of that size, as did an indigenous population that once numbered a half-million. As an environmental disaster it has been compared in scale to the drying up of the Aral Sea in Central Asia and to the deforestation of the Amazon. “The impact on biodiversity has also been catastrophic,” states a 2004 United Nations study on the marshes. The depletion of the marshes has led to species extinctions with many others at risk. The fisheries, which provided a large share of Iraq’s overall catch, crashed. The effects of the destruction radiate far beyond southern Iraq. No longer cleansed by the marshes, the salty and polluted waters flowing into the Persian Gulf from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are playing havoc with marine life there, including the lucrative shrimp business and coastal fisheries. The marshes were once the permanent habitat for millions of birds and a flyway and staging area for millions more migrating between Siberia and Africa.The UNEP Marshlands project – “Support for Environmental Management of the Iraqi Marshlands” – is helping Iraqi partners to restore the Marshlands and manage them sustainably. Opportunities for practical cooperation are continually identified and evolving during discussions between representatives of Iraqi authorities (at the national, governorate, and local levels), UN agencies, bilateral organizations, and other stakeholders. UNEP has been involved in coordinating activities of donor countries, as well as those of other agencies, and various organizations involved in the restoration and sustainable management of the Marshlands. UNEP’s responsibilities include coordinating these activities with the work of Iraqi governmental entities. Various entities have endorsed the liaison role of UNEP and its contribution as a key partner, especially in the case of activities concerned with the ecological aspects of marshlands management. The development goal of the Iraqi Marshlands project is to support the sustainable management and restoration of the Iraqi Marshlands. The UNEP Marshlands project has been underway since 2003.As the former regime ended, people began to open floodgates and break down embankments that had been built to drain the Marshlands. Satellite images and analysis revealed by UNEP in 2006 showed that almost 50 percent of the total Marshlands area has been re-flooded with seasonal fluctuations. Many areas are seeing the return of native plants and animals, including rare and endangered species of birds, mammals, and plants. The rate of restoration is remarkable, considering that reflooding occurred around 2003. Although recovery is not so pronounced in some areas because of elevated salinity and toxicity, many locations seem to be functioning at levels close to those of the natural Al-Hawizeh marsh, and even at historic levels in some areas. Recent field surveys have found a remarkable rate of reestablishment of native macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, fish, and birds in reflooded marshes. Monitoring and evaluation of UNEP pilot projects and the state of the wetlands ecosystem is ongoing with reports and publications continuing to be produced by various research teams and stakeholders.At least three major questions remain to be answered: (1) Will water supplies needed for marsh restoration be available in the future, given the competition for water from Turkey, Syria, and Iran, as well as competing water uses within Iraq itself? (2) Can the Marsh Arab culture ever be reestablished in any significant way in the restored marshes? (3) Can the landscape connectivity of the marshes be reestablished to maintain species diversity? What is clear is that water supply alone will not be sufficient to fully restore all the marshes, and thus a goal of management should be to establish a series of marshes with connected habitats of sufficient size to maintain a functioning wetland landscape (Richardson and Hussain 2006; Lawler 2005; Richardson and Hussain 2005; UNEP 2006, 2007).Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry, Other For at least 5000 years, humans have widened and dredged channels, dried and flooded fields, and built reed houses atop artificial islands of reed bundles within the Iraq Marshlands. The lifeblood of this wetland was the spring floods coming down the Euphrates and Tigris river systems with most of this water originating outside Iraq. Beginning in the 1950s, governments began diverting that flow, first by creating natural lakes within Iraq and later by building large dams on both rivers. There are now nearly three dozen major dams, with eight more under construction and a dozen in the planning stages. The result of this half-century of water management has been dramatic. The spring flood is barely noticeable. The maximum flow of the Euphrates during May has dropped by two-thirds since 1974, when dam building began in earnest. Even before the 1991 Gulf War, many experts feared the result would irreparably harm, and eventually destroy, the Iraq marshlands. Severe deforestation from overgrazing upstream, combined with more than a decade of drought in the Middle East, exacerbated the environmental problems to the point at which Minister Latif believes the marshes would soon have been history even without Saddam Hussein’s regime. However, it was Hussein’s regime that delivered the coup de gráce. Part of the Iran-Iraq border runs through the wetlands, and during the 1980s war, both sides built causeways and drained marshy areas for better access to the front. After the first Gulf War and the unsuccessful uprising of Shiite Muslims in the south, the Iraqi government set about draining the remaining marshes. Its goal was to remove the threat of insurgency and replace the marsh culture of fishing and rice production with dry agriculture. Massive dikes and canals were built to divert water from the marshes, quickly turning them to desert (Lawler 2005; Richardson and Hussain 2005; UNEP 2006, 2007).
The sheer scale of the destruction has been likened to biblical proportions. As an environmental disaster it has been compared in scale to the drying up of the Aral Sea in Central Asia and to the deforestation of the Amazon. In one generation, some 20,000 square kilometers of marsh shrank to a tenth of that size, as did a population that once numbered a half-million. The marshes are actually three distinct regions, each with its own particular ecosystem. The once vast Central Marsh, which covered more than 3000 square kilometers in 1973, has shrunk by 97%. Most of what remains are reeds growing in irrigation canals. Another marsh, called al-Hammar, lost 94% of its area, and al-Hawizeh, which borders Iran, is two-thirds smaller than 3 decades ago. Even the Hawr al-Azim Marsh, which is the Iranian extension of al-Hawizeh, is less than half its size due to reductions in water flow from Iraq. As the marshes turned to desert, local peoples fled or were forced from their homes. Left behind were vast salt flats laced with insecticides and landmines. “The impact on biodiversity has also been catastrophic,” states a 2004 United Nations study on the marshes. The depletion of the marshes has led to the extinction of an otter, bandicoot rat, and a long-fingered bat particular to the marshes, and 66 species of water birds and other animals are at risk. The fisheries, which provided a large share of Iraq’s overall catch, crashed. The effects of the destruction radiate far beyond southern Iraq. “The wetlands were like a vast sewage treatment plant for the Euphrates and Tigris system,” says Hassan Partow, who helped write the U.N. report, “they were the kidneys”, without them, the patient is imperiled. No longer cleansed by the marshes, the salty and polluted waters flowing into the Persian Gulf from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are playing havoc with marine life there, including the lucrative shrimp business and coastal fisheries. The marshes were once the permanent habitat for millions of birds and a flyway and staging area for millions more migrating between Siberia and Africa (Lawler 2005; Richardson et al. 2005). The Iraqi Marshlands are one of the world’s largest wetland ecosystems and constitute the largest wetland ecosystem in the Middle East and Western Eurasia. Satellite images of the Marshlands in the early-mid-1970’s show around 20,000 square kilometers of water surface and wetland vegetation (although diversion of flow has been ongoing through human history in the region especially following the 1950’s). The Marshlands, consisted of interconnected lakes, mudflats and wetlands in the lower part of the Tigris-Euphrates basin of Iraq and Iran. The Iraq Marshlands are a crucial part of intercontinental flyways for migratory birds, support endangered species, and sustain freshwater fisheries, as well as the marine ecosystem of the Persian Gulf. In addition to their ecological importance, these Marshlands are unique from the global perspective of human heritage. They have been home to indigenous communities for millennia (Lawler 2005; Richardson and Hussain 2005; UNEP 2006, 2007). The development goal of the Iraqi Marshlands project is to support the sustainable management and restoration of the Iraqi Marshlands (UNEP 2007), with the following immediate objectives: (1) to monitor and assess baseline characteristics of the marshland conditions, to provide objective and up-to-date information, and to disseminate tools needed for assessment and management, (2) to build capacity of Iraqi decision makers and community representatives on aspects of marshland management, including: policy and institutional aspects, technical subjects, and analytical tools, (3) to identify EST options that are suitable for immediate provision of drinking water and sanitation, as well as wetland management, and to implement them on a pilot basis, (4) to identify needs for additional strategy formulation and coordination for the development of longer term marshland management plan, based on pilot results and
cross-sectoral dialogue.

Monitoring Details: Monitoring is continuing to assess the recovery, and additional efforts are now being focused on measuring plant and fish production, changes in water quality, and specific populations of rare and endangered species. Unfortunately, no research is under way to assess how agriculture and the marshes can share scarce water supplies, to identify toxic problem areas, to study the problems of insecticide use by local fishermen, or to conduct a complete survey of the marshes to determine optimum restoration sites, because of limited funding and increased violence in the area. However, the long-term future of the former Garden of Eden really depends on the willingness of Iraq’s government to commit sufficient water for marsh restoration and to designate specific areas as national wetland reserves. Political pressure from the international community to maintain water supplies flowing into Iraq will also be critical to the restoration of the marshes (Richardson and Hussain 2006).



Following the end of this pilot project in 2009, UNEP and UNESCO established a joint project titled ""Natural and Cultural Management of the Iraqi Marshlands"" that builds upon the successful model of the pilot. UNEP notes that previous monitoring of water quality, biodiversity, and vegetative cover have provided a snapshot of historical environmental conditions. Project leaders have transferred the necessary equipment to Iraqi stakeholders and provided training in order to allow continued monitoring. 



The project aims to guide and support Iraqi stakeholders through the development of a sustainable management plan for the Iraqi Marshlands that complies with the World Heritage inscription process.

Iraqi authorities and donor governments have engaged in dialogue and coordination activities concerned with the restoration and sustainable management of the Marshlands since 2003. United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and other UN groups play an increasingly active role in promoting such activities. Opportunities for practical cooperation are continually identified and evolving during discussions between representatives of Iraqi authorities (at the national, governorate, and local levels), UN agencies, bilateral organizations, and other stakeholders. UNEP has been involved in coordinating activities of donor countries (including Canada, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom and United States), as well as those of the World Bank, other UN agencies, and various organizations involved in the restoration and sustainable management of the Marshlands. UNEP’s responsibilities include coordinating these activities with the work of Iraqi ministries and other relevant Iraqi bodies including the Ministry of Environment (MOE), Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR), and the Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works (MMPW). Various entities have endorsed the liaison role of UNEP and its contribution as a key partner, especially in the case of activities concerned with the ecological aspects of Marshlands management.
Other agencies and non-governmental organizations involved in aspects of the restoration of the Iraqi Marshlands and/or the people and culture associated with this area include groups such as Eden Again, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Center for Restoration of the Iraqi Marshes (CRIM) (an organization of several Iraqi ministries). Universities and scientists both within and outside of Iraq have played a role in the various specific projects surrounding the restoration of the Marshlands and their native inhabitants. Iraqi communities, community leaders and their citizens, especially those surrounding the project region, have played an integral role in the restoration, planning, and implementation of project aspects (Lawler 2005; Richardson et al. 2005; UNEP 2006).

Description of Project Activities: Extensive ecological damage to the Iraqi Marshlands area, with the accompanying displacement of much of the indigenous population, was identified by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations/World Bank Needs Assessment Initiative for the Reconstruction of Iraq as one of the country's major environmental and humanitarian disasters.  In 2001, UNEP alerted the international community to the destruction of the Marshlands when it released satellite images showing that 90 percent of the Marshlands had already been lost. Experts feared that the Marshlands ecosystems would be completely lost within three to five years unless urgent action was taken.  UNEP has continued to be the leading agency reporting on the condition of the Marshlands.  As the former regime ended, people began to open floodgates and break down embankments that had been built to drain the Marshlands. Re-flooding has since occurred in some, but not all, areas.  Satellite images and analysis by UNEP show that approximately up to 50 percent of the total Marshlands area has been re-flooded with seasonal fluctuations (UNEP 2006).

Water quality problems include contamination by pesticides, by untreated industrial discharge, and by sewage originating upstream. Pollution and the high salinity levels of both water and soil are in part due to the limited flow of water through the Marshlands.  A 2003 UN inter-agency assessment and a public health survey conducted by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) indicated that safe drinking water had become the inhabitants' most critical need. While some people could buy tanker water, many others had no choice but to drink untreated, unfiltered marsh water. UNEP's dialogues with the local communities and government officials confirmed that provision of safe drinking water was the number one priority for the local population.  To protect human health and livelihoods and to preserve the area's ecosystems and biodiversity, the Iraqi authorities included water quality and Marshlands management on the priority list for reconstruction under the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) Iraq Trust Fund and made direct appeals to donor governments for assistance (UNEP 2006).

In July 2004, the Iraq Trust Fund Steering Committee of the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) approved the Marshlands project and implementation began the same year.  Additional funding has been provided by numerous sources.  UNEP was requested to play a coordinating role in the Marshlands management activities of various UN and bilateral agencies, and of Iraqi institutions.  The International Environmental Technology Centre (IETC), located in Japan, is carrying out project implementation.  IETC promotes and implements Environmentally Sound Technologies (ESTs), including management systems, for: disaster prevention; production and consumption; water and sanitation.  IETC is part of UNEP's Division of Technology, Industry and Economics (UNEP DTIE) (UNEP 2006).  

Phase I (2004 - ) of the Marshlands project is being implemented within the framework of the UNDG Iraq Trust Fund.  Work during Phase I focuses on: safe drinking water; sanitation and wastewater treatment; and wetland and water quality management.  There is a strong emphasis on providing Iraqi partners with specialized training.  Continuous information exchange takes place with Iraqi stakeholders, including ministry representatives, professionals associated with academic institutions, and community leaders.  The Arabic-English Marshlands Information Network (MIN) is a web-based platform used to share data, analysis, and analytical tools.  Websites created by Iraqi partner institutions exist in both languages.  A number of individuals in ministries, governorates, and non-governmental bodies are using this platform.  To foster greater environmental awareness among Marshland inhabitants, UNEP was also able to support three community level initiatives in southern Iraq.  The initiatives were proposed, implemented, and reported on by community members.  Monitoring of the initiatives was overseen through a unique collaboration among the local Environment Directorates, the Governing Councils, and the Arab Marshlands Councils (UNEP 2006).

Phase II (2006 - ) is now running in parallel with Phase I and building on its success.  Planning for Phase II was carried out with the Iraqi Ministries of Environment (MOE), Water Resources (MOWR), and Municipalities and Public Works (MMPW).  Phase II-A: strategy formulation and coordination; baseline data collection and assessment; capacity building.  Activities supported include: coordinated data collection and analysis of water, environmental, and socio-economic parameters; expanded use of the MIN to share and manage data; provision of additional hardware, software, and training.  Phase II-B: drinking water provision and water quality management; pilot implementation and community level awareness; and awareness raising.  Activities supported include: a pilot project for drinking water provision in another community; an additional training course; an International Workshop, to be held in Kyoto in December 2006; continued initiatives at local community level; the update of awareness raising materials (UNEP 2006).

The involvement of Iraqi communities in decision-making on projects that directly impact them is growing.  Meaningful improvement of the Marshlands depends on community support and initiatives. UNEP therefore introduced small-scale community level initiatives in the three southern governorates.   Example 1: The Marsh Arab Council of Thi-Qar undertook an initiative to raise awareness of the dangers of fishing using poison within the Marshlands Environment.  To address this important issue, the Marsh Arab Council launched a public awareness campaign.  Short training courses were given to tribal chiefs and religious leaders.  The Marsh Arab Council and Ministry of Environment sought the assistance of the newly trained tribal chiefs and religious leaders to help explain the adverse affects associated with fishing by poison to local fishermen and their families.  The overall rationale behind the campaign was to begin to create an atmosphere in which using poison for fishing will become unacceptable within Marshlands society and will lead to the elimination of this practice.  Example 2: The initiative to Develop an Understanding Among Marshland Residents in Missan on the Importance of the Marshland Ecosystem had two components, the second was a training course for young people, on the importance of the Marshlands environment.  The purpose of this course was to stimulate interest in environmental issues and to begin the process of viewing the Marshlands as a common good requiring trans-generational management (UNEP 2006).

Beginning in 2004, a series of ten training courses within Phase I and two additional courses within Phase II were organized by IETC, responding to needs identified by relevant Iraqi institutions.  Each course was designed to enhance Iraqi participants' knowledge of developments in areas such as environmental policy and institutional aspects; technical capability; and data and IT management.   These courses supported practical capacity building, with linkages to pilot project implementation, policy analysis and development, and data management.  Courses consisted of lectures in English and Arabic, demonstrations, and group exercises.  Participants took an active part in discussions and other activities.  Most courses included site visits.  Training manuals were prepared in Arabic and English. Course material was organized under three headings: policy and institutional; technical; and data management and analysis.  The training courses corresponded to elements of UNEP's Marshlands project.  Courses were designed using the ""train the trainers"" model. I n this way, participants can pass on the knowledge acquired to their colleagues.  UNEP provides support for ""secondary training,"" including provision of training materials and funding for course organization.  Five secondary courses have been organized in Iraq so far by the Ministry of Environment (MOE), the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR), and the Universities of Basrah and Thi-Qar.  Trained personnel from the earlier courses helped to organize and deliver lectures for the secondary training (UNEP 2006). 

In June 2006, as a Phase II-A activity, IETC organized a meeting with technical experts from the Iraqi Ministries of Environment (MOE), Water Resources (MOWR), and Municipalities and Public Works (MMPW).   The meeting's overall purpose was: to assist Iraqi ministries in effectively analyzing, presenting, and sharing available data using the Marshlands Information Network (MIN); to develop a strategy for initial data collection efforts concerning basic demographic and socioeconomic data and solid waste management in the Marshlands.  At the meeting, Iraqi officials (in collaboration with IETC staff) accomplished the following: developed plans for each ministry to coordinate data collection inside the Marshlands, to continue the upkeep and updating of the MIN, to further develop effective reports using existing and forthcoming data, and to expand use of the MIN as a tool to share and manage data; used existing data provided by ministries as examples of how to analyze, share, manage, and upload effective reports; completed reorganization and streamlining of the MIN site structure for the ministries' MIN web sites.  The Marshlands Information Network (MIN) provides a forum for information and data sharing.  All institutions taking part in the Marshlands' restoration and management have access to this cost-effective, internet-based tool through a version of the Environmentally Sound Technology Information System (ESTIS) in Arabic.  ESTIS is an innovative, multi-language e-service developed by IETC in 2003 (UNEP 2006).

Monitoring and evaluation of UNEP pilot projects and the state of the wetlands ecosystem is ongoing with reports and publications continuing to be produced by various research teams and stakeholders.  One example is a recent study by Richardson and Hussain (2006) that sought to assess the level of marsh restoration.  The vast amount of former marsh area prevented the authors from completing a detailed ecological analysis of all the reflooded sites.  The researchers covered the three historic marsh areas (Central, Al-Hawizeh, and Al-Hammar), we selected four very large marshes: Al-Hawizeh, the only natural remaining marsh on the Iranian border; the eastern Al-Hammar marsh; Abu Zarag (western Central marsh); and Suq Al-Shuyukh (western Al-Hammar). From 2003 until 2005, the researchers monitored water quality, water depth and transparency, soil chemistry conditions, and ecological indicators of plant and algal productivity; and surveyed the numbers and species of birds, fish, and macroinvertebrate populations (for a detailed analysis of the field and laboratory chemistry methods and statistical analyses used in this article, see Richardson et al. 2005 and others).  This original work was done in conjunction with Iraqi scientists to assess the ecological and environmental conditions present where the dominant flora and fauna in the natural Al-Hawizeh still existed and to compare these conditions with those of three marshes reflooded in 2003.  To provide an estimate of overall ecosystem health, the researchers completed an ecosystem functional assessment (EFA) to determine restoration progress to date and to establish how the newly reflooded marshes were functioning compared with the natural marsh and with historical values.

In the EFA method, indicators of ecosystem function are grouped into five ecosystem-level functional categories: hydrologic flux and storage, biological productivity, biogeo-chemical cycling and storage, decomposition, and community/wildlife habitat.  Next, a carefully chosen set of variables representing these five functional categories are selected as key indicators to be measured in the affected ecosystems and in a set of reference ecosystems.  Key indicator values obtained in the field from the affected ecosystem are scaled against those from reference ecosystems to determine whether there are significant shifts in these indicators.  The EFA analysis of the marshes was somewhat compromised in terms of the collection of the most appropriate key indicators for each function because of the difficulty of sampling in remote and dangerous areas of Iraq.  Thus, these estimates of ecosystem health are less quantitative than a standard EFA. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Satellite images and analysis revealed by UNEP in 2006 showed that almost 50 percent of the total Marshlands area has been re-flooded with seasonal fluctuations.  Many areas are seeing the return of native plants and animals, including rare and endangered species of birds, mammals, and plants.  The rate of restoration is remarkable, considering that reflooding occurred around 2003.  Although recovery is not so pronounced in some areas because of elevated salinity and toxicity, many locations seem to be functioning at levels close to those of the natural Al-Hawizeh marsh, and even at historic levels in some areas.  Recent field surveys have found a remarkable rate of reestablishment of native macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, fish, and birds in reflooded marshes (UNEP 2007; Richardson and Hussain 2006). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Uncontrolled releases of Tigris and Euphrates River waters after the 2003 war have partially restored some former marsh areas in southern Iraq, but restoration is failing in others because of high soil and water salinities.  Although the uncontrolled reflooding is welcome news, it presents potential problems and challenges regarding the quality of water including: the release of toxins from reflooded soils that are contaminated with chemicals, mines, and military ordnance; flooding of local villages and farms now developed on the edges of formerly drained marshes; and a false sense of security regarding the volume of water that will be available to restore the marshes in future years.  Of concern is the potential for the bioaccumulation of toxic elements such as Se up the food chain, which could result in severe toxic effects in the marshes for higher trophic levels.  Finally, it is unknown if sufficient water supplies can be made available, especially in drought years, to maintain long-term successful marsh restoration over large areas (Richardson et al. 2005). 

Water:

Approximately 70% of the water entering Iraq comes from river flow controlled by Turkey, Iran, and Syria. Annual rainfall only averages around 10 cm in southern Iraq, while evapotranspiration rates can reach nearly 200 cm.  Groundwater sources are highly saline and not useful for drinking or irrigation without expensive treatment. A series of major trans-boundary water issues include the completion of the massive Southeastern Anatolia Irrigation Project (GAP) in Turkey, with 22 dams supplying irrigation water to 1.7 million hectares (ha) of agricultural land, and the Tabqa Dam project in Syria, supplying water to 345,000 ha of irrigated land.  In addition, the dike being built by Iran to cut off the Iranian water supply to the Iraqi portion of the Al-Hawizeh is nearing completion (Richardson et al. 2005). The water from the Iranian project reportedly will be sold to Kuwait, which suffers severe freshwater supply problems. The AtatÁ¼rk Dam, built in Turkey as part of GAP in 1998, can store more than the 30.7 billion cubic meters (m3) of water that flows annually through the Euphrates from Turkey into Iraq; this dam alone could almost dry up the Euphrates (Richardson and Hussain 2006). 

There are now nearly three dozen major dams, with eight more under construction and a dozen in the planning stages. Turkey alone can store up to 91 billion cubic meters of water and will need more to irrigate its dry eastern provinces. Iraq and Syria can store as much as 23 billion cubic meters. The 2003 war and its aftermath halted plans to build additional dams in Iraq--there are currently a dozen large ones--but Iran recently embarked on a major dam-building effort on tributaries of the Tigris. The result of this has been the spring flood is barely noticeable. The maximum flow of the Euphrates during May has dropped by two-thirds since 1974, when dam building began in earnest. Severe deforestation from overgrazing upstream, combined with more than a decade of drought in the Middle East, exacerbated the environmental problems to the point at which Minister Latif believes the marshes would soon have been history ""even without Saddam."" (Richardson and Hussain 2006).

Projected future demands for water for agriculture and other human uses are enormous, with estimates of Iraq's water needs close to 95 billion m^3 by 2020; however, only 48 billion m^3 are estimated to be available after Turkey and Syria complete their dams.  It is estimated that to restore 10,000 km^2 of marshes will require from 20 billion to 30 billion m^3 of water, nearly 50% of Iraq's available water after the completion of the water projects and dams in Turkey and Syria.  It is clear from these estimates that there will not be enough water to meet the projected needs of Iraq's population and agriculture; thus, the marshes will be in direct competition for water. This will be especially true in drought years. However, some of the used agricultural water may be adequate for use in the marshes, but that has not been studied in terms of elevated salinity and long-term nutrient and pesticide effects (Richardson and Hussain 2006).

Given the competition for water among cities, agriculture, and marshes, serious shortages will exist, especially in dry years.  Another problem will arise when areas that have been partially restored after water has been released into them have their water supplies cut off during drought-year shortages. This will result in further destruction of soil structure and overall loss of biota. To prevent this, a set minimum yearly water allocation should be made to the most viable former marsh areas.  Bottom line, given the fast pace of dam construction in countries upstream and the possibility of another drought, though, renewed desertification is likely.  In Iraq, the Center for Restoration of Iraqi Marshes will need to work closely with all the ministries, especially the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Agriculture, to maintain future water supplies for the marshes. The wild card in this plan is the Ministry of Oil, which has not actively participated in the marsh restoration program; vast quantities of oil are reported to exist under former marsh areas in southern Iraq (Richardson and Hussain 2006).

Water Quality:

It is not clearly understood by many engineers and water managers that reflooding does not equal wetland restoration.  While the presence of adequate water is critical to marsh restoration, the restoration of wetland functions requires also the proper water hydroperiod (period of time water is at or near the surface), hydropattern (distribution of water over the landscape), and good water quality. These conditions are complex in nature. Restoration projects that do not take this complexity into account can at first seem to be successful, but they are later recognized as failures because conditions promoting important ecosystem functions have not been adequately restored.  Water flow through the year in some areas kept the salinity concentrations low and prevented the buildup of potentially toxic elements, such as selenium and salts, that was seen in the diked areas of Al-Sanaf.  Now, dams, dikes, and canals prevent the overflow of water at the marsh edges, thus reducing the historical inundation pattern of the marshes.  The restricted water outflows in the Al-Sanaf, coupled with high regional evapotranspiration rates, have resulted in extremely high ion concentrations, pH, and TDS, values similar to those measured in highly salinized portions of the Jordan River. Results from Al-Sanaf suggest that simply adding water to former marshes without providing for continual flushing will result in excessive salinity and toxicity problems (Richardson and Hussain 2006; Richardson et al. 2005).

Toxic levels of sulfides and salts have been reported in a few areas of the reflooded marshes.  Minefields exist throughout the marshes along the border of Iran, and a number of villages were flooded by the destruction of dikes and dams.  Marsh restoration has been further complicated by the construction of more than 30 dams and several thousand kilometers of dikes in Iraq during the past 30 years. This infrastructure has resulted in the retention of large volumes of water in the central portions of Iraq for cities and agriculture, as well as in the reduction of new sediment accumulation in the marshes.  During the past two years, high snowmelt from the mountains of Turkey and Iran has resulted in near record flows on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, resulting in vast amounts of excess water being available for re-flooding of the marshes, but it is unknown how long this pattern of increased water release will last.  Regardless, restoration may be difficult in some localized areas, because soil conditions and water quality in the drained and diked (as compared with the reflooded and natural) marshes clearly demonstrated massive shifts in ion chemistry and structure. For example, many areas of the marshes were severely burned after drainage. The intensity of the burns in some areas, with high surface organic matter covering sulfidic pyrite soils beneath, resulted in soils being greatly altered chemically and then exposed to oxygen for decades of draining, resulting in the formation of sulfuric acid.  These highly oxidizing conditions liberate iron (Fe), Ca, Mg, and trace elements like copper as well as producing toxic conditions and sodic or calcic soils when reflooded.  Moreover, X-ray scanning electron microscopy work suggests that the burned soils where iron sulfide (FeS2) has been converted to iron oxide maghermite (Fe2O3) now have a texture like ceramic, meaning that the soil will not rewet and cannot support plant life.  The soil chemistry analysis results suggest that reflooded and drained marsh areas can be restored, but some locations will have excessive salt accumulation problems, toxic elements, and severe water quality degradation, with a concomitant loss of native marsh vegetation.  It is imperative that these areas be identified so that the limited water supplies can be used to restore those areas with the most promise for full restoration (Richardson and Hussain 2006; Richardson et al. 2005).

Connectivity:

Wetland habitat fragmentation (disconnected patches), one of the most commonly cited causes of species extinction, and ensuing loss of biological diversity are quite evident when surveying the distance between reflooded marshes.  The sparsely vegetated reflooded areas are very scattered compared with the contiguous wetland landscape found in 1973.  In addition, many of the former water flow connections between marsh patches are now blocked by dikes and canals. The Al-Hawizeh, the only remaining natural marsh, is under current threat from a large Iranian dike.  Landscape connectivity, the inverse of landscape fragmentation, is now considerably reduced, which can have significant effects on population survival and metapopulation dynamics for macroinvertebrates, fish, amphibians, and even plants (Richardson and Hussain 2006; Richardson et al. 2005).

Politics and People:

Coming up with a common vision--and financing--in an unstable nation may prove even harder than collecting data. ""This is a scientifically difficult and tremendously complex effort,"" says Edwin Theriot, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers official who has advised the Iraqi government. ""We're having difficulties with the Everglades and in Louisiana--and we're supposed to have all the resources we need.""  It is clear the political climate in Iraq is still volatile.  In fact, for at least one study, Iraqi scientists declined to be interviewed about their work, fearing reprisals from insurgents - but one such scientist went on record as saying data collection is ongoing.  Although he also stated that researchers are still harassed at times by the bandits who roam the region.

One interesting turn following the fall of last regime are that many believe the marsh people are not interested in restoring all the marshes, wanting some restored and some left dry for agriculture.  Peter Reiff, an anthropologist who works on the marsh issue as a USAID contractor, notes that local Marsh Arabs have abandoned their old way of life cultivating rice and using water buffalo: ""They are becoming farmers, and they get better returns with sheep, wheat, and cattle."" And he accuses outsiders such as Alwash of possessing ""a wistfulness about the marshes that is almost romantic. You are not going to make this into an ethnographic museum."" Iraqis themselves are divided. Minister Latif says he is ""not very keen on the word ""restoration""--restoring does not help the population."" He favors a plan that focuses on health, education, and transportation needs.  And the long-suffering local people appear to want it all. During two recent conferences on the marshes held in southern Iraq, participants urged that the wetlands be restored--and that new schools, clinics, and roads be built to lift them out of their dire poverty.  CRIM is supposed to bring all these disparate parties together. But some doubt it has the political and financial muscle to do so. ""CRIM is understaffed, under-resourced, undertrained, if well-intentioned,"" says one foreign scientist involved in its creation.  And negotiating a deal with Turkey, Syria, and Iran on water rights--a crucial element in any restoration plan--poses a daunting diplomatic challenge. ""It is quite obvious that there isn't enough water to restore all the desiccated marshes,"" says Farhan.  Even the enthusiastic Alwash--who calls the Eden Again project ""his mistress""--acknowledges that full restoration is unrealistic, given the constraints of water, money, and political will (Lawler 2005).

And on""¦

What is clear is that water supply alone will not be sufficient to fully restore all the marshes.  Iraq must also use water more efficiently and cut waste if the country is to have enough water to meet its future needs.  For example, the continued use of the ancient method of flooding vast agricultural fields from open ditches, coupled with extremely high evapotranspiration rates, results in massive losses of water to the atmosphere and increased soil salinity problems.  Modern drip irrigation approaches used throughout other parts of the Middle East need to be employed to preserve Iraq's dwindling water supply.

Monitoring is continuing, unfortunately no research is under way to assess how agriculture and the marshes can share scarce water supplies, to identify toxic problem areas, to study the problems of insecticide use by local fishermen, or to conduct a complete survey of the marshes to determine optimum restoration sites, because of limited funding and increased violence in the area. However, the long-term future of the former Garden of Eden really depends on the willingness of Iraq's government to commit sufficient water for marsh restoration and to designate specific areas as national wetland reserves.  Political pressure from the international community to maintain water supplies flowing into Iraq will also be critical to the restoration of the marshes (Richardson and Hussain 2006; Richardson et al. 2005).

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: As the former regime ended, people began to open floodgates and break down embankments that had been built to drain the Marshlands.  Re-flooding has since occurred in some, but not all, areas. Satellite images and analysis by UNEP show that approximately up to 50 percent of the total Marshlands area has been re-flooded with seasonal fluctuations.  To protect human health and livelihoods and to preserve the area's ecosystems and biodiversity, the Iraqi authorities included water quality and Marshlands management on the priority list for reconstruction under the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) Iraq Trust Fund and made direct appeals to donor governments for assistance.

With both phases of the UNEP Marshlands Project underway, the following benefits can be identified: * ESTs are being introduced and implemented, making use of Iraqi expertise: up to 22,000 people in six pilot communities (Al-Kirmashiya, Badir Al-Rumaidh, Al-Masahab, Al-Jeweber, Al-Hadam, and Al Sewelmat) have access to safe drinking water supplied by common distribution taps; by the middle of 2006, 23 kilometres of water distribution pipes and 86 common distribution taps had been installed; partly because drinking water was made available through this project, people are returning to pilot site areas; as stability returns, possibilities for finding employment and rebuilding life in the marsh ecosystem are increasing; a sanitation system pilot project is being implemented in the community of Al-Chibayish.  The EST, constructed wetlands, aims to serve approximately 170 inhabitants, who face health hazards from discharges of untreated wastewater to a nearby canal; wetland rehabilitation and reconstruction initiatives are being implemented in cooperation with the Center for the Restoration of Iraqi Marshlands of the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR). * Input is being provided for a long-term management plan to benefit people and ecosystems in Southern Iraq. This input includes: experience with suitable management options; recognition of local communities as stakeholders; assessment of policy and institutional needs; identification of (and engagement with) evolving and emerging Iraqi institutions associated with marshlands management; provision of analyzed data, gathered through water quality testing, satellite image analysis, and remote sensing.  * The capacity and knowledge of Iraqi decision-makers, technical experts, and community members are being enhanced. Policy and institutional elements, technical knowledge, community engagement, and analytical methods are among the aspects being addressed.  * Employment opportunities related to assessment, pilot applications, awareness raising, and monitoring are being developed at professional and community levels. 

Using Environmentally Sound Technologies (ESTs), safe drinking water is being provided to the inhabitants of six pilot Marshlands communities and a sanitation system (""constructed wetlands"") is being introduced in another community.  The EST pilot projects were planned and carried out with full stakeholder involvement.  In view of their desperate need for safe drinking water, residents of the Marshlands have responded overall with great satisfaction.  Previously, inhabitants drank unclean marsh water (associated with a high rate of disease) or purchased drinking water trucked in from distant locations.  In these pilot communities there is increased optimism and a desire to renew life within the Marshlands.  The presence of the pilot water treatment plants has encouraged many households to return and begin rebuilding their lives here.  This is reflected in increased livestock numbers, contributing in turn to the production of dairy products, reed crafts, and other items that can be sold in market centres.  Water treatment plant operators are satisfied with the equipment's ease of operation.  Extensive training is not required in order to operate it.  The project faced many challenges and constraints at the outset, principally due to lack of understanding of the project's potential health and economic benefits.  However, the timely completion of pilot projects supplying safe water is having a tremendous impact with respect to building confidence in this project within communities.  

Meaningful improvement of the Marshlands depends on community support and initiatives.  UNEP therefore introduced small-scale community level initiatives in the three southern governorates.  Beginning in 2004, a series of ten training courses within Phase I and two additional courses within Phase II were organized by IETC, responding to needs identified by relevant Iraqi institutions.  Courses were designed using the ""train the trainers"" model. In this way, participants can pass on the knowledge acquired to their colleagues (UNEP 2006).

A functioning marsh ecosystem will undoubtedly benefit the people of Iraq in numerous direct and indirect ways.  Release of water in many areas is resulting in the return of native plants and animals, including rare and endangered species of birds, mammals, and plants.  The rate of restoration is remarkable, considering that reflooding occurred in 2003.  The marshes were once famous for their biodiversity and cultural richness. They were the permanent habitat for millions of birds and a flyway for millions more migrating between Siberia and Africa.  More than 80 bird species were found in the marshes in the last complete census in the 1970s.  Populations of rare species which had been thought close to extinction, were recently seen in a winter bird survey.  Coastal fish populations in the Persian Gulf used the marshlands for spawning migrations, and the marshes also served as nursery grounds for penaeid shrimp and numerous marine fish species.  The return of marsh areas will likely help restore this function.  This also goes toward the marshlands serving as a natural filter for waste and other pollutants in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, thus protecting the Persian Gulf.

Some of the former Marsh Arabs have chosen to return to the marshes. On several trips researchers noted an increasing number of families returning to Suq Al-Shuyukh and Al-Hammar. When asked why they returned, they simply stated that they had no other place to go and that the marsh provides some protection and food.  Moreover, many of the former Marsh Arabs are now successfully farming on the edge of the marshes. For the first time in their lives, many are making a meager living by farming wheat, rice, and barley (Richardson and Hussain 2006).
The restoration of southern Iraq’s Mesopotamian marshes is now a giant ecosystem-level experiment. Uncontrolled release of water in many areas is resulting in the return of native plants and animals, including rare and endangered species of birds, mammals, and plants. The rate of restoration is remarkable, considering that reflooding occurred around 2003. Although recovery is not so pronounced in some areas because of elevated salinity and toxicity, many locations seem to be functioning at levels close to those of the natural Al-Hawizeh marsh, and even at historic levels in some areas. At least three major questions remain to be answered: (1) Will water supplies needed for marsh restoration be available in the future, given the competition for water from Turkey, Syria, and Iran, as well as competing water uses within Iraq itself? (2) Can the Marsh Arab culture ever be reestablished in any significant way in the restored marshes? (3) Can the landscape connectivity of the marshes be reestablished to maintain species diversity?
What is clear is that water supply alone will not be sufficient to fully restore all the marshes, and thus a goal of management should be to establish a series of marshes with connected habitats of sufficient size to maintain a functioning wetland landscape. Iraq must also use water more efficiently and cut waste if the country is to have enough water to meet its future needs. For example, the continued use of the ancient method of flooding vast agricultural fields from open ditches, coupled with extremely high evapotranspiration rates, results in massive losses of water to the atmosphere and increased soil salinity problems. Modern drip irrigation approaches used throughout other parts of the Middle East need to be employed to preserve Iraq’s dwindling water supply.
Monitoring is continuing to assess the recovery, and additional efforts are now being focused on measuring plant and fish production, changes in water quality, and specific populations of rare and endangered species. Unfortunately, no research is under way to assess how agriculture and the marshes can share scarce water supplies, to identify toxic problem areas, to study the problems of insecticide use by local fishermen, or to conduct a complete survey of the marshes to determine optimum restoration sites, because of limited funding and increased violence in the area. However, the long-term future of the former Garden of Eden really depends on the willingness of Iraq’s government to commit sufficient water for marsh restoration and to designate specific areas as national wetland reserves. Political pressure from the international community to maintain water supplies flowing into Iraq will also be critical to the restoration of the marshes (Richardson and Hussain 2006). Input is being provided for a long-term management plan to benefit people and ecosystems in Southern Iraq. This input includes: experience with suitable management options; recognition of local communities as stakeholders; assessment of policy and institution needs; identification of (and engagement with) evolving and emerging Iraqi institutions associated with marshlands management; and provision of analyzed data, gathered through water quality testing, satellite image analysis, and remote sensing (UNEP 2006, 2007).

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-new-jersey-the-restoration-of-an-urban-floodplain-in-rahway/	USA: New Jersey: The Restoration of an Urban Floodplain in Rahway	United States of America	1994-11-21	2005-11-21	"The highly urbanized Rahway River watershed in New Jersey suffers from frequent flooding due to extensive development and destruction of riparian wetlands and floodplains. A diverse group of stakeholders worked together to restore a 1.8 ha site on the floodplain to riparian wetland with the goals of providing wildlife habitat, filtering pollutants from stormwater runoff, providing stormwater retention to minimize flooding, and providing public access for passive recreation as well as education about wetlands and watershed management. This wetland restoration site has been incorporated into the Union County Parks System as the Michael S. Bezega Wetlands Observation Area. Due to the urban setting (14 houses were removed from the site), the project design and implementation were very complex. Developing the water budgets required analyses of the tidal Rahway River as well as stormwater runoff from local drainage areas. Funding was obtained from six different funding agencies, and the project was constructed largely with city and county public works personnel. Native plants were installed by volunteers who continue to do invasive species management at the site. Key factors contributing to the success of this project include extensive involvement of a diverse partnership of stakeholders, a multi-disciplinary project team, thorough up-front design and engineering analyses, careful selection of vegetation palettes based on analyses of reference wetlands, and extensive on-site supervision of the construction crews by personnel who could make design decisions in the field (Obropta and Kallin 2007).Urbanization, Transportation & Industry, Other Since the early 1600’s, when the British first colonized the area between the early settlements of Perth Amboy and Rahway, the Rahway River watershed region has supported the longest continuously urbanized communities of New Jersey. The man-made landscape and its impacts to the watershed have been dramatic. During the nineteenth century the project area was a farm, and filling and plowing probably modified the natural geology. At the beginning of the twentieth century, roads and houses were built. As additional houses were built, more fill was probably added to this area.
Comparing data from 1922 to about 1970 and then 1970 to the present, it is clear that the hydrodynamic characteristics of the Rahway River have fundamentally changed. Destruction of wetlands, channelization, and increasing development within the watershed have resulted in the basic hydrology becoming much flashier, with lower average base flows and much higher, more frequent flood events (Obropta and Kallins 2007). Rahway City maps dated 1787 show the restored area as a wetland along the Rahway River. Early colonists and seafarers spoke of the abundance of wildlife, a sea of meadows and mature forests that graced the shores of the Rahway River. The ultimate goal was to restore the floodplain to its predevelopment condition. The restoration goal was to provide wetland mitigation, enhanced and expanded wildlife habitat, and green space in the urban center (Obropta and Kallins).

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
This restoration effort benefited from a diverse partnership that continued to grow during the project. State, local, and federal agencies joined with local environmental organizations, church groups, and large corporations to help fund the design and construction of this restoration effort. The first and most important step in the project was building a strong partnership of stakeholders. The partnership was built on the collaborative efforts of James Lynch of the City of Rahway’s Redevelopment Department, Steven Barnes of the NY/NJ Baykeeper’s office, a local non-profit organization that has championed environmental restoration projects, and Christopher Obropta, a consultant from the environmental consulting firm TRC Omni Environmental Corporation. Chris Obropta grew up in the area and was particularly interested in giving back to the community. The three worked together to recruit support from the Union County Parks and Recreation Department, the Mayor of Rahway, and the Union County Freeholders. A landscape architect from an engineering firm, the Reynolds Group, and an engineer from TRC Omni worked together to draft a short report including a rendering of the concept. These efforts were enough to sell the project to Union County and the City of Rahway. The project was also presented to New Jersey’s Wetlands Mitigation Council.

Description of Project Activities: During the project's first year of action in 2000, 13 houses were razed and their foundations filled in.  Care was taken to preserve any trees during these demolitions, and the areas were reseeded with annual rye grass (Lolium sp.) to control erosion.  As a result, the vegetation over most of the site was essentially turf grass and shade trees, with approximately 0.27 ha of woods along the northwest corner of the site, along the river's edge, and in the drainage swale in the southeast corner.  During the initial survey, all trees over 25 cm diameter were marked and identified.  There were 93 trees, the predominant being red maple (Acer rubrum), silver maple (Acer saccharinum), pin oak (Quercus palustris), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima).  Soil borings and test pits verified the presence of native soils.  The native floodplain soils were located wherever the elevation was less than 2 m and were detected under the fill layers at approximately that elevation.  Soil samples were tested for nutrients, pH, and organic matter, and the results indicated that the substrate soil had to be amended to increase organic content.  Union County has a leaf composting facility nearby and provided compost as a soil amendment.  Two major elements are required for the water budget at this site: runoff from precipitation over an area of approximately 4.7 ha and inundation from the river itself. Two stormwater outfalls discharged directly to the Rahway River, one just upstream and the other in the middle of the site.  The original design called for these outfalls, as well as overland flow from streets and parking lots, to be rerouted to forebay areas in the wetlands.  Runoff from 1.86 ha was to be discharged to a wet meadow in the northwest quadrant of the site.  After flowing through the wet meadow, any water not infiltrating or evaporating would enter the first wet pond.  Overflow from there would seep through the center wet meadow and scrub-shrub wetland into a second wet pond or emergent wetland and eventually to the river.  Runoff from approximately 2.8 ha to the south and west enters the site via a swale off the end of Allen Street near the center of the site.  This runoff flows overland through the lower wet meadow scrub-shrub area.  Water budgets were calculated separately for the upper wet meadow and pond and the lower wet meadow and pond using average monthly precipitation from the last ten years obtained from the New Jersey State Climatologist at Rutgers.  Seepage rates were based on pre-construction percolation tests performed near the wet pond locations (Obropta and Kallin 2007).   Additional details on the water budget calculations can be found in Obropta and Kallin (2003).  

The water budget for the inundation due to the Rahway River was a bit more complicated.  The U.S. Geological Service (USGS) has had a gauging station on the Rahway River approximately 880 m upstream from the site since 1922, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has conducted two major hydrological studies of the Rahway.  Comparing data from 1922 to about 1970 and then 1970 to the present, it is clear that the hydrodynamic characteristics of the Rahway River have fundamentally changed.  Destruction of wetlands, channelization, and increasing development within the watershed have resulted in the basic hydrology becoming much flashier, with lower average base flows and much higher, more frequent flood events.  Using channel profiles and stage measurements taken during the previous USACE studies and an estimated inflow elevation (the depth when water from the river would overtop the banks and enter the wetland) of 2 m, Manning's equation was used with a range of reasonable roughness parameters to estimate the flows required to overtop the bank at this level.  These calculations indicate that, depending on the roughness parameter used, a flow of 13.5 to 24 cubic meters per second (cms) is required to reach this stage.  The daily flow data for the past ten years were analyzed to determine how many days each year's flows exceeded these levels.  These data show that at 18 cms, the site would be inundated from one to ten (average 5.3) times during the year.  This reflects a minimum number of days when the river would inundate the site, since it would typically take two to three days for the water to recede or infiltrate after each flooding event.  Project leaders figured this would be adequate to maintain wetland conditions, supported by the fact that areas on the site and on the floodplain on the other side of the river with elevations below 2 m have wetland vegetation, soils and hydrology.  Based on calculations project leaders set the elevation of the inlet swale at 2 m.  The invert of the outlet pipe from the lower wet pond was set at 1.7 m so that water would ""back in"" from the lower wet pond during high flow events.  As a result, when the water comes in over the inlet swale in the northwest quadrant of the wetland, the wetland is already full and erosive forces are significantly reduced. As the water recedes, the wetland drains slowly from the discharge pipes at the lower end of the wetland.

A wetland seed mix was applied to the wetland areas, and a wildflower/warm season grass seed mix was applied to the transition areas and upland areas.  In addition to seeding the entire site, 10,000 herbaceous plants (in 5-cm peat pots) were planted throughout the wetland.  The planting plan also specified 5,000 shrubs in the transition areas around the wetlands.  These shrubs were purchased in 3.8 L and 7.6 L containers and planted 0.9 to 1.8 m apart, depending on the species.  In addition to the herbaceous plants and shrubs, 25 larger-diameter trees were installed.  The plant species were chosen to emphasize diverse and flowering plants, using the existing forested floodplain wetlands upstream as a reference site, as well as the Wetlands Floodplain Forest and Red Maple-Hardwood Swamp sections of a local planting guide (see reference in Obropta and Kallin 2007).  Most of the species listed in the guide were present on the nearby island and floodplain.  

The design also included an invasive species control plan.  Project designers located the emergent wetlands in heavily shaded areas to discourage purple loosestrife, and established dense colonies of native sedge and rush species to resist invasion.  The ongoing monitoring program, to be carried out by the Union County Parks Department, will target the identification and control of invasive species.  

Owing to the river herring spawning run, the majority of the construction could not begin until July 1, 2002.  Over 3,000 cubic yards of anthropogenic fill was taken from the site to a local landfill where it was used as capping material. Approximately 2,300 cubic meters of compost material was brought into the site to amend the soil.  A local contractor was hired to assist in the excavation, hauling, and removal of concrete debris.  Apart from a walking path, stone retaining wall, and stormwater routing from the upper outfall, construction was completed by September 2002.  Over 350 volunteers contributed four intense days between September 11 and September 14 planting more than 7,000 herbaceous plugs and 3,500 trees and shrubs.  The second phase of the construction, in spring 2003, involved the walking path, stone retaining wall, and additional plantings.  A mason from the Parks Department provided guidance and quality control.  In May 2003, the site was officially incorporated into the Union County Parks Rahway River Greenway and dedicated as the Michael S. Bezega Wetlands Observation Area.  The final phase of construction took place in fall 2005.  The original design called for routing the discharge from a stormwater catchbasin just upstream to a swale at the northwest corner of the wetland.  Unfortunately, an easement could not be obtained from one of the property owners at an affordable price.  This meant that instead of 1.9 ha draining to the upper wet meadow, only 1 ha was contributing runoff to the site, which was sufficient to maintain wetland conditions in the wet meadow, but the pond was frequently dry.  To increase the amount of water flowing to the upper wet pond, project designers modified the design to include a pipe between the river and the upper wet pond. This pipe included a one-way valve to allow flow from the Rahway River.  The invert of the pipe was set at 1.68 m, which means that a flow of approximately 15 cms in the Rahway River will result in water flowing to the pond if there is less than 15 cm of water in the pond.  Based on historical flow data, this should occur roughly once a month.  This will increase the amount of stormwater treated by the wetland since the river is predominately stormwater when flowing over 15 cms, and will serve to keep water in the upper wet pond virtually all the time.

Rutgers University, in conjunction with the volunteer effort of the Rahway River Association, has implemented a post-construction monitoring program.  In addition to monitoring the plants as required by the NJDEP wetlands permit, the pollutant removal efficiency of the wetlands will be studied via water quality sampling and soil sampling.  With the bulk of the planting effort completed in fall 2002, the vegetation monitoring program began in 2003.  At each site project leaders took photographs and recorded the coverage of dominant and invasive plant species. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: At the end of the first full growing season, the wetland easily achieved well over 85 percent coverage of target hydrophytes.  The wet meadows were dominated by willow-weed, or curlytop knotweed (Polygonum lapathifolium), a native annual forb that was not in any of the seed mixes but may have been included in the compost that augmented the soils in these areas.  It is also possible that seed was carried by a flood event.  At the upper wet meadow and pond, coverage of willow-weed approached 80 percent, interspersed with a diverse mixture of tussock sedge (Carex stricta), bluejoint grass (Calamagrostis canadensis), fox sedge (Carex vulpinoidea), soft rush (Juncus effusus), smooth bur-marigold or beggartick (Bidens laevis), and nodding bur-marigold (Bidens cernua). The edges of the swales were dominated by boneset (Eupatorium perfoliatum), blue lobelia (Lobelia siphilitica), and New York aster (Symphyotrichum novi-belgii [= Aster novi-belgii]).  The wet pond areas were dominated by swamp rosemallow (Hibiscus moscheutos), pickerel weed (Pontederia cordata), and duck potato (Sagittaria latifolia).  The shrubs along the sides of the pond include buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) and redosier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera).  A small stand of broad-leaved cattail along the northern edge of the upper pond covered approximately 3 percent of the pond area.  At the end of the second growing season in 2004, the major change noted in the vegetation was a significant decrease in willow-weed dominance.  Coverage was no more than 10 percent anywhere. The dominant vegetation in the wet meadows was the nodding and smooth bur-marigolds, with nearly 80 percent cover.  Boneset and New York ironweed (Vernonia noveboracensis) were common throughout both wet meadows (10 percent cover). Significant new species included sweet flag (Acorus calamus) in the upper wet pond and center wet meadow and spatterdock (Nuphar lutea ssp. variegata) in the lower wet pond.  Chufa, or yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus), was noted in both wet meadow areas. The patch of cattails had spread to cover slightly less than 5 percent of the upper wet pond, and scattered plants (over 1 percent) were present in the upper wet meadow.  The lower wet pond had been colonized by both common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus heteroclitus). Of note, a pair of black-crowned night herons (Nycticorax nycticorax), a threatened species in New Jersey, nested in a tree adjacent to the wetland.  By the end of the third growing season in 2005, the wet meadows had developed into a very diverse ecosystem.  Spotted Joe-Pye weed (Eupatoriadelphus maculatus), sweet flag, and swamp milkweed (Asclepias incarnata) were common, especially in the upper meadow. The upper portion of the center wetland meadow/swale area was dominated by boneset, tussock sedge, and chufa, while boneset and New York asters dominated the edges of the swale. Coverage by target hydrophytes was 100 percent. There were numerous scattered cardinal flowers (Lobelia cardinalis) and blue lobelia. A few common reed and purple loosestrife plants scattered throughout the center wet meadow were pulled up by the roots and discarded off-site.  Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) invaded along some of the swale edges, but mostly in the transition area and not in the wetter areas.  The patch of cattails in the upper wet pond had spread slightly but still covered less than 5 percent of the pond area.  The black-crowned night herons returned to nest a second year (Obropta and Kallins 2007). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The Michael S. Bezega Wetlands Observation Area is surrounded by a highly urbanized setting.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The restoration project was preceded with an economic buyout of private property and houses in a troubled floodplain zone.  Further restoration activities of the site helped provide flood mitigation, enhanced wildlife habitat, retained and filtered stormwater runoff, and provided opportunities for public recreation and education in an urban setting.
Rutgers University, in conjunction with the volunteer effort of the Rahway River Association, has implemented the post-construction monitoring program.

With the bulk of the planting effort completed in fall 2002, the vegetation monitoring program began in 2003. At each site Obropta and Kallin (2007) took photographs and recorded the coverage of dominant and invasive plant species. Success criteria for constructed wetlands in New Jersey require 85 percent cover by target hydrophytes and less than 10 percent invasive species. Relevant invasive wetland species listed by NJDEP included Japanese knotweed, purple loosestrife, common reed, and broad-leafed cattail (Typha latifolia). The restoration site has been incorporated into the Union County Parks System and will be managed by the Union County Parks, Recreation, and Facilities Department. "

This distinct desert ecosystem supports hundreds of plant and animal species that are closely associated with, and often dependent upon, the area’s unique wetland and aquatic habitats. Among these species, 24 are found only in Ash Meadows, constituting the largest concentration of endemism for an area this size in the continental United States. Twelve species are currently listed under the Endangered Species Act.
Historical land use has altered the landscape and habitat of these springs. Agricultural activities, road-building, and earth removal for water diversions and dams have resulted in large-scale disturbance to surface soil and vegetation, as well as large-scale hydrologic changes. This disturbance has allowed the proliferation of invasive species. A goal for the refuge is to restore spring sources and outflow channels and associated riparian habitat.Â  In order to accomplish this goal, the primary restoration actions have included 1) returning spring flows from former agricultural diversion and drainage systems to natural drainage networks, 2) removing hydrologic alterations such as berms, impoundments, and levees, 3) and controlling and eradicating invasive plant and animal species such as tamarisk, knapweed, star thistle, bass, convict cichlid, crayfish, and bullfrog. To date, restoration work has been completed on two springs. As funding allows, more restoration work is planned on other springs on the Refuge.Agriculture & Livestock, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Historical land use has altered the landscape and habitat of these springs. Agricultural activities, road-building, and earth removal for water diversions and dams have resulted in large-scale disturbance to surface soil and vegetation, as well as large-scale hydrologic changes. In addition, this disturbance has allowed the proliferation of invasive species. Of particular concern for the native fishes has been the introduction of non-native fish species such as mosquitofish, and sailfin molly, which have preyed on native fish larvae and/or competed for habitat. Non-native crayfish have also preyed on native fish larvae. Non-native plant species, such as tamarisk, also compete with native species for the scarce water resources within the Refuge, and have drastically altered the habitat. Ash Meadows NWR supports at least 24 endemic plants and animals – the highest density of endemic species in the United States. Ash Meadows NWR is inhabited by six endangered and eight threatened species, the majority of which are found nowhere else in the world. In addition, the refuge supports numerous organisms that are characteristic of desert riparian habitats of the American southwest. Therefore, it is of extraordinary value to biodiversity and to the preservation of unique habitats.
Listed species in the refuge include an endangered plant, the Amargosa niterwort (Nitrophila mohavensis); six threatened plants, the spring-loving centaury (Centaurium namophilum), Ash Meadows ivesia (Ivesia eremica), Ash Meadows blazing star (Mentzelia leucophylla), Ash Meadows milkvetch (Astragalus phoenix), Ash Meadows sunray (Enceliopsis nudicaulis var. corrugata), and Ash Meadows gumplant (Grindelia fraxino-pratensis); a threatened invertebrate, the Ash Meadows naucorid; and four endangered fishes, the Devils Hole pupfish, Warm Springs pupfish (Cyprinodon nevadensis pectoralis), Ash Meadows Amargosa
pupfish (C. n. mionectes), and Ash Meadows speckled dace. Ash Meadows NWR has a recovery goal of ecosystem and species restoration. Recovery criteria for meeting this goal involve restoration of the natural distribution of habitats, as well as self-sustaining populations of all species throughout the Refuge. In 1990, a recovery plan was written for Ash Meadows NWR, which listed the recovery needs for 12 listed species. It also identified tasks necessary to down-list/de-list these species. Although emphasis was placed on endangered species, the plan recognized the necessity for recovery of the ecosystem processes on which these species depend. The Recovery Plan identified the following objectives in the service of down-listing/de-listing endangered fish:
1. Eradicate all non-native species from essential habitat.
2. Protect the Ash Meadows aquifer.
3. Reestablish flow to historic channels.
4. Protect essential habitat from human disturbances.
5. Restore historic fish distributions.
6. Create and maintain refugial populations of the Devil’s Hole pupfish.
7. Maintain populations of Devil’s Hole pupfish at a minimum of 300 in winter and 700 in summer.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: To date, restoration work has been completed on Kings Spring and Jackrabbit Spring.Â  As funding allows, more restoration work is planned on other springs on the Refuge.

Kings Spring 

Restoration actions at Kings Spring included reconstruction of the spring pool and outflow channel.Â  Local rock was used to create rock shelves in order to create breeding and foraging habitat for the Ash Meadows pupfish (Cyprinidon nevadensis mionectes).Â Reshaping Kings Pool required a reduction to the size of its original perimeter, an increase in the slope of its bank, and the armoring of the bank with slabs of caliche rock, in order to limit re-establishment of cattail.

The Kings Spring outflow channel was designed and constructed to accommodate the discharge from Kings Spring as well as the occasional flooding due to overland flow from an adjoining alluvial fan.Â  The restoration of the connection of the alluvial fan to the outflow channel was critical for the delivery of coarse sediment which is the preferred substrate for the endangered Ash Meadows naucorid (Ambrysus amargosus).Â  In addition, the occasional channel scour associated with flooding from the alluvial fan is critical for the maintenance and creation of spring channel habitat at Kings Spring.Â  Three ephemeral washes, which were historically part of the Kings Spring watershed, were reconnected to the Kings Spring channel by removing the berm that blocked their access and regrading the washes to their original slope.

A mesquite-ash dominated system was re-established by placing excavated topsoil, then transplanting and seeding native vegetation along the stream banks and floodplain. Nursery-grown trees and shrubs were also planted in the floodplain.

Jackrabbit Spring

The first 1,500 feet of channel downstream from the spring source was semi-natural as historical channelization for irrigation was abandoned and the channel began to adjust toward sinuosity after maintenance of the ditch ceased.Â  The channel had a low width-to-depth ratio with a slope which allowed higher-velocity channel flow  -  conditions favorable to native Ash Meadow speckled dace.Â Given this, the reach was used as a general reference for the channel reconstruction design downstream.Â Â  The channel reconstruction took place on 1,500 additional feet of stream channel, beginning approximately 1,500 feet downstream from the spring source.Â  

""¨""¨Channel reconstruction began with draining of agricultural impoundments, removal of berms, filling of the impounded areas with coarse material, and recontouring the site to its natural topography ""” the approximate slope of the upstream reference reach.Â  Design objectives for the channel reconstruction were to create a narrow (18- to 24-inch-wide), swift (1-1.5 feet per second), and deep (6- to 18-inch) channel  -  dimensions similar to other channels in which Ash Meadows speckled dace had thrived.Â  The higher velocity was also important in preventing the channel from filling in with vegetation.Â  Confining the channel was important in preventing sheet-flow, maintaining the thermal load of the stream, and minimizing the development of cattail marsh.Â  Coarse sediment has been added to the excavated channel, and rock and log structures were installed to create riffles and pools, allowing for drift-feeding stations for the Ash Meadows speckled dace.Â  ""¨""¨Restoration efforts also included mechanical removal of salt cedar, revegetation within the outflow channel corridor, and culvert replacement.Â  The previous pipe culvert was approximately 2,500 feet downstream from the reconstructed channel.Â  It was undersized and had a 12-inch drop at the outlet, which created a barrier to upstream movement of speckled dace.Â The new concrete box culvert was installed to improve fish passage and to reduce the amount of cattail marsh created by the backwater effect of the former culvert.

""¨""¨Vegetation restoration was completed on 1,120 acres within the burned area around Jackrabbit Spring Creek.Â  It included control of non-native invasive weeds using herbicide and mechanical treatments, and planting of native species.  Noxious weeds, including Russian knapweed, salt cedar, Maltese star-thistle, Russian olive and hoary cress were chemically treated. In April 2006, mechanical removal of invasive salt cedar and chemical treatment of five-hook bassia and Russian knapweed took place. Removal of salt cedar was done by SWEAT. ""¨

Native grasses/forbs, shrubs and trees were planted within the perimeter of the burned area during September through October 16, 2006. A total of 250 acres were planted and seeded. Â Plants were propagated from native seeds.Â  Cuttings were collected from the Refuge during Fall 2005 and Spring 2006, and grown by the Community College of Southern Nevada in Las Vegas. Seed which was not used for plant propagation was spread in disturbed areas to enhance natural recovery of native plants. Velvet ash, willows, mesquite, bunch grass, and salt grass represented the bulk of the species planted. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Proactive restoration efforts in Kings Spring drainage of the Ash Meadows NWR has promoted control of non-native fish populations and a swift return of native fish populations to desirable levels. There was a significant shift in species composition of the channel. Prior to restoration, native fish were only 23 percent of the total fish population. Five years following restoration, native fish were 91 percent of the total population. This percentage is expected to increase once the marshy habitat downstream of the project area is restored.

In the Jackrabbit Springs drainage, initial observations show that Ash Meadows speckled dace have moved downstream from the natural channel and are using the reconstructed channel. It is too soon to evaluate the progress and results of weed management and revegetation efforts. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Early observations of the reconstructed channel in Jackrabbit Spring conclude that the channel has widened and become more shallow. In the majority of the stream, the banks have sloughed into the channel due to either insufficient compaction or other characteristics of the soil used. Additional work will be done this winter to narrow and deepen the channel, including adding rocks, logs, and willow wattles for bank stabilization. Juniper and mesquite fenceposts are also being collected from the NWR and used for bank stabilization.
Research provided critical understanding of habitat preferences of native versus non-native fish. Understanding these habitat preferences within the refuge allowed a sound restoration design that promoted native fish over non-native fish. The sailfin molly and mosquitofish, typical invaders of thermal springs of the American Southwest, prefer lentic conditions. The restored channel configuration of Kings Spring drainage included maintaining the spring’s elevated temperature and establishing a conversion of Kings Spring Pool outflow from marsh to warm water lotic habitat. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service monitoring of Ash Meadows native fish have taken place since 1989. The monitoring protocol has typically involved a single annual sampling run to limit research impacts on fish health, using minnow traps at major springs. Mark-recapture estimation has been repeatedly conducted and has been used to estimate the population size of each target species. In addition, notes on the numbers of non-native fish, crayfish, and other species have been recorded.
Restoring native vegetation at the Kings Spring site and across the Refuge has been a challenge. Non-native species continue to be a concern. A revegetation plan is being written for Kings Spring and additional funding will be sought. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-arizona-north-simpson-habitat-restoration-project/	USA: Arizona: North Simpson Habitat Restoration Project	United States of America	2000-01-01	2030-01-01	"The North Simpson Habitat Restoration Project is a project of Tucson Audubon Society on lands owned by the City of Tucson, Arizona. The project involves the planting of numerous native tree, shrub, grass, and forb species on the floodplains of a near-perennial riparian area that came into existence since the 1970s as a consequence of municipal effluent discharge. The project’s design is to use the newly available water resources to improve riparian habitat to offset riparian habitat elsewhere in the Tucson basin that was lost due to groundwater pumping , mis-management of the Santa Cruz River, and  destroyed by urban development. The site itself did not historically  have perennial water,  but had been a very wide xero-riparian forest before the river was channelized and bermed to support extensive agriculture at the project site. The intention of project managers is to create ecosystem functions that mesh with the now-available water resources, as well as structural diversity of the habitat to benefit wildlife in the area. Tucson Audubon has conducted classes in restoration at the site, offered birding tours, does ongoing monitoring of completed projects within the site to provide a clear picture of the results of their work and is continuing to work on new areas within the larger project site.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation, Other By the mid-twentieth century, the Simpson Farm site had little or no native vegetation remaining on it, the Santa Cruz River that bisected the property was channelized to control the intermittent flows in response to stormwater, and the surrounding floodplain was functionally disconnected from the river for all but the largest storm events. After the site was retired from agricultural use in the 1970s, it sat fallow until the project began. During this time, due to soil sterilization, compaction, and floodplain disconnection, the site failed to regenerate substantial native vegetation that had been on site before the industrial agriculture phase. Before the 1880s, the Santa Cruz River was comprised of a number of perennial stream stretches through the Tucson Basin with accompanying cottonwood-willow riparian forest immediately along the channel, and mesquite bosque in the adjacent floodplain.  After an ill-conceived canal caused extensive downcutting of the river,  decades of groundwater overdraft, and agriculture on the near floodplain, the river dried up. Extensive stretches of riparian vegetation died due to lack of water availability and to provide wood for the growing city. The location of the Simpson Habitat project is at the very downstream end of what is historically known to have contained riparian habitat – habitat supported by intermittent flows in response to storms in a channel that migrated laterally up to a mile or more with regularity. Cottonwood-willow habitat with mesquite surrounding is the habitat that today is found to have the highest density of breeding bird populations in Southern Arizona. This project, though, cannot follow the traditional approach of aiming to replicate a reference habitat due to the functional mismatches that occur between the water availability, soil conditions, and floodplain connectivity. Instead, project managers are aiming to create a novel assemblage that provides the maximal habitat value and long-term functional sustainability within the particular extant site constraints. The Simpson Habitat Restoration Project aims to improve ecological connectivity to other ecologically rich ecological corridors such as the Brawley/Los Robles Wash, which passes through the Buenos Aires Wildlife Refuge in the Altar Valley and within a mile of the Simpson Site, and to extend the wildlife corridor connecting corrridors between the Waterman Mountains of the Ironwood Forest National Monument, and the other surrounding mountain ranges including the Tucson Mountains, the Santa Catalinas, the Tortolitas, and the numerous ranges further afield that are connected by the main stem of the Santa Cruz River and its numerous tributaries. Central to the mission of the Tucson Audubon Society was the goal to restore vital bird habitat to the Santa Cruz River valley. The habitat enhancement strategy for the river stretch focuses on widening and diversifying the vegetation growing along the channel and increasing floodplain connectivity where possible, to make more and richer wildlife habitat.

Monitoring Details: Avian monitoring is done quarterly following the Arizona Important Bird Areas protocol and has allowed us to track species diversity and population size response within the project area. Specific new project components are monitored for establishment rates as well as diversity, density, and stand structure.
Beginning in the 1970s, the City of Tucson began discharging treated effluent into the Santa Cruz River channel. In the 1970s and 1980s the City of Tucson purchased 23,000 acres of adjacent farmland for groundwater rights and subsequently retired the farmland. Tucson Audubon Society became involved in the project in 2000, signing a 99-year right-of-entry lease with the city, with the agreement to restore habitat and monitor wildlife on the initial 1,700 acres.

Description of Project Activities: Tucson Audubon Society developed a site assessment and work plan, before they began spreading seed and planting trees and shrubs. Once the initial work plan was established, Tucson Audubon utilized a large pool of volunteers though restoration work days at the site to build irrigation systems, water harvesting swales, and to plant trees, shrubs, and grasses.  Employing a wide pallet of species, work at the Simpson site has planted a wide variety of trees including: mesquite, palo verde, elderberries, desert willow, walnut, cottonwood, and willow.  Habitat restoration at the Santa Cruz River Habitat Project also involved a complete plant pallet (shrubs, grasses, cacti, annuals, etc., in addition to trees) to fully restore the known historical diversity among the riparian and floodplain communities.  In addition, students from Sunnyside, Tucson and Desert View High Schools and from other schools throughout Pima County were involved. Seed is pelletized by mixing it with native clay and water, and then rolling it into balls or pushing it through a mesh that breaks it up into small pieces. In this innovative technique, the clay dries around the seed and provides a protective coat that reduces predation by birds, insects, and rodents. In the next heavy rainfall the clay dissolves and exposes the seed precisely when germination conditions are most favorable. Plant species were chosen for the site based on their historical presence in the area, successful use in other restoration efforts, recommendations from experts, suitability to site soil, their benefit to wildlife, and other criteria. The mix of plant species was also important and all new plants were arranged in groups and tucked in around existing plants to create ""guilds"" (an association of plants that benefit each other and enrich the entire habitat). Through the use of 'restoration workshops', the staff of Tucson Audubon was able to gain hundreds of hours of volunteer labor for the project while also providing an educational outreach component to their work. Plants were irrigated so that they can be watered for several years until they can survive on their own. Since making the system self-sustaining was another important goal, plants were placed in deep earthen basins with stout downhill berms so that rainwater will be concentrated around them. The use of deep organic mulch reduces evaporation from the soil, and gradually breaks down to add nutrients. The main strategy has been to use trees and shrubs that will do well on the river berms away from direct influence of the stream. These species will broaden the swath of vegetation along the river corridor but will be able to survive on rainwater alone. These include mesquite (Prosopis velutina), blue palo verde (Parkinsonia florida), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), graythorn (Ziziphus obtusifolia), alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides), and many others. The abandoned farm fields surrounding the river have very low vegetation diversity and density. Here we plant and sow seeds of a similar array of native, drylands species. The basin holding the plants also fills with water during heavy rains, focusing runoff from surrounding areas around the roots of the plant.  The project also does large-scale imprinting on old farm fields. This involves pulling a cylinder implement with protrusions over the fields with a tractor, leaving a pattern of shallow indentations in the ground. Then another tractor spreads seed on the imprinted land, which tends to settle into the indentations along with finer sediments and blown organic materials. The indentations also help focus rainwater on the seeds which then have a greater chance of surviving and growing. How this project eliminated existing threats to the ecosystem: Tucson Audubon Society developed a site assessment and work plan before they began spreading seed and planting trees and shrubs. Once the initial work plan was established, Tucson Audubon utilized a large pool of volunteers through restoration work days at the site to build irrigation systems, water harvesting swales, and to plant trees, shrubs, and grasses. Work at the Simpson site has planted a wide variety of trees including: mesquite, palo verde, elderberries, and desert willow, and, immediately adjacent to the effluent flow, cottonwood, and willow. Habitat restoration at the Santa Cruz River Habitat Project also involved a wide functionally diverse pallet (shrubs, grasses, cacti, annuals, etc., in addition to trees) to restore both the known historical diversity of the floodplain communitie, as well as to create the riparian gallery forest newly allowed by the increased water resources of municipal effluent. Through the use of 'restoration workshops', the staff of Tucson Audubon was able to gain hundreds of hours of volunteer labor for the project while also providing an educational outreach component to their work. Plants were irrigated so that they can be watered for several years until they can survive on their own. Since making the system self-sustaining was another important goal, plants were planted in shallow water-harvesting basins with stout downhill berms to concentrate available rainwater to their roots. 

The abandoned farm fields surrounding the river had very low vegetation diversity and density. The main strategy has been to focus on the habitat of the broadly disconnected floodplain by using trees and shrubs that will do well on the river berms away from direct influence of the stream, but that can survive intermittent flooding. These species broaden the swath of vegetation along the river corridor but will be able to survive on rainwater alone. These include mesquite (Prosopis velutina), blue palo verde (Parkinsonia florida), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), graythorn (Ziziphus obtusifolia), alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides), and many others.  In the early stages of the project the managers tried a range of arid-land techniques touted for their successes in other areas including pelletizing seed and imprinting the soil. Though both techniques came highly recommended, they were not shown to be successful at this project site. The likely cause is the very infrequent periodicity with which sufficient rainfall occurs to establish perennial plants from seed - roughly a decadal event. Direct irrigation of both seeded and container stock was the only establishment technique shown to have a high likelihood of success. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: To date, the work at the Simpson site has seen thousands of plants established via miles of irrigation line installed while hundreds of acres were seeded--with little result. Habitat has improved at North Simpson with increased plant diversity, density, and structural diversity--all made possible only by direct restoration efforts; the previous 30 years of being fallow had seen none of these improvements. Improvement has also resulted from the absence of cattle, which were fenced out in 2001. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Because the Santa Cruz River at the Simpson site was not an historically perennial stream, recovery is a tricky term in its usage here. With the growth of urban Tucson and a tightly developed floodplain, the Santa Cruz River through the city has little chance of being broadly restored. The habitat enhancement efforts downstream, with the newly available effluent water resources represent a physical translocation of what has been largely lost within the city. However, huge berms, both legal and illegally created, hem the river in at the project site and have thus far only been breached in a few target areas to re-establish some minor levels of floodplain connectivity. Further breaching of these berms to re-establish broad connectivity is the primary limiting factor hampering the re-establishment of a broad floodplain vegetation community at the site.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The decline of the riparian vegetation along the Santa Cruz river was a phenomenon not limited to Tucson alone. Along long distances of its reach, the Santa Cruz has undergone drastic vegetative change, with significant sections being completely developed in the latter half of the twentieth century. The reestablishment of large sections of riparian forest is extremely valuable for bird populations in an important region for bird migration and nesting. The loss of bird diversity has coincided with 80-90 percent riparian habitat across the state of Arizona. The restoration of riparian habitat is critical for bird species throughout the arid southwest. Tucson Audubon's efforts to involve the public in restoration efforts has broadened the understanding and appeal of restoration throughout Tucson. The effort to involve a large slice of the community has increased the visibility of the project, making it valuable for educating the public about the need for further restoration in the Santa Cruz watershed.
The primary lesson learned through the many years of this project  has been that the success of seeding is directly dependent on annual rainfall…and that, while much cheaper than planting stock or seed with irrigation, it has been in most years a waste of time, effort, and money. When it works, it is amazing, and doesn’t need the intensive effort inputs of imprinting or creating clay seedballs to succeed.
Another critical element of the Simpson site has been its grant-funding mandated monitoring of birds. The objective of the bird monitoring was to document changes in bird numbers and diversity. Seasonal surveys along the 1.4-mile survey are an effective monitoring approach allowing analysis of differential site use and importance to differing suites of birds by season, as well as allowing documentation of changes in site use through time as the habitat has developed.  We have been able to show statistically significant responses, through time, in terms of increases to both diversity and density of birds using various portions of the property, and that the multiple habitat types within the large project area are valuable at different times of year to differing species. The edges of the project, most disconnected from any flood flows, are supporting more grasses and desert upland plants and play a much more important role during the winter to wintering sparrow species while the riparian gallery is significantly more important during the summer breeding season.
To assess the impact of our work on the broader floodplain,  we utilized two survey transects that were set up when the project was first initiated – one north of and one south of the Santa Cruz River. Both surveys went through retired agricultural fields which had been fallow for the same duration (since the late 1970s) and neither survey included the gallery forest along the river which has been outside the restoration area. While the north and south sides of the river were not completely identical in original conditions, they’re about as similar as can be found. South of the river served as the control, no restoration work had been done there at the time of the surveys. To the north of the river, we had been working constantly; planting trees, shrubs, grasses and annuals to improve habitat value. Both transects were surveyed synchronously numerous times though the winter (October 03,2012—April 05, 2013)– one pair of surveyors on the north, one pair on the south. Our methodology minimized differences between the two areas making the results of the surveys more clearly contrast the habitat value for birds. Over the course of the  surveys we recorded an average of 14.6 species at each survey point south of the river while in the restored area to the north we recorded an average of 24.9; a whopping 70.6% increase. We also looked at the density of native birds utilizing the habitat. More than 2.2x as many native individuals utilized the restored area than were recorded to the south. A decade of hard work is paying off for the birds in a big way. Tucson Audubon holds a 99-year right-of-entry lease with the City of Tucson for the North Simpson Site and as such has specific requirements for long term monitoring of bird populations as well as habitat conditions for other wildlife species. Additionally, new projects continue to be implemented on site. Long-term monitoring will help determine the overall success of plantings at the restoration site, and how they are affecting wildlife. Regular avian surveys are carried out to see whether habitat is really being enhanced in a way that increases numbers and diversity of birds. Project managers are also monitoring survivorship of plantings, changes in vegetation coverage and diversity, and changes in the river channel morphology to determine site stability over time. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/australia-returning-the-botanical-richness-of-the-jarrah-forest-in-restored-bauxite-mines-in-western-australia/	Australia:  Returning the Botanical Richness of the Jarrah Forest in Restored Bauxite Mines in Western Australia	Australia	1966-01-01	2007-12-01	"Alcoa World Alumina Australia operates two bauxite mines at Willowdale and Huntly in the Darling Range of southwestern Australia, 80 – 140 kilometers south of Perth. The mine pits range in size from one hectare to tens of hectares. Alcoa has been rehabilitating its bauxite mines since 1966; today some 550 hectares are mined and rehabilitated annually. The technology of rehabilitation has been improved continuously over the years – from plantations of exotic pine trees to a sophisticated state-of-the-art rehabilitation program. Alcoa’s aim after bauxite mining in these areas is to re-establish all the pre-existing land uses of the forest: conservation, timber production, water production and recreation. Re-establishing a jarrah forest on the mined areas that is as similar to the original forest as possible was determined to be the best way to achieve this goal.Alcoa has been successful in reaching its goal. In 2000, the company documented that, on average, 100 per cent of the indigenous plant species found in representative jarrah forest sites would also be found in a 15-month-old rehabilitation, with at least 20 per cent of those found being from a recalcitrant species priority list. The goal now is to maintain this good record and thus the botanical richness of mined areas after mining operations have ceased.Mining & Resource Extraction There are currently approximately 1.8 million ha of intact Jarrah forest in Western Australia, about 65% of the total compared to pre-European settlement. Currently, Alcoa mines and rehabilitates 500-600 ha of this forest each year at open-cut mines located between 55 and 130 km south of Perth (pop. 1,500,000), the capital city. Because of the close proximity to the capital, bauxite mining is being done on lands subject to multiple usage. These uses include urban water catchment, timber production, and recreation.
Bauxite mining occurs in isolated pods of 1 – 100 ha in area, averaging 10 – 20 ha. Usable timber is extracted by contractors prior to mining. After timber harvest, the mining sequence involves: clearing the remaining vegetation, removing the soil, blasting the cemented bauxite layer or ripping it with a bulldozer, and removing and crushing the bauxite before transporting it to the refineries. Containing at least 784 plant species, the jarrah forest is renowned for its diverse flora. It is one of the most plant-species-rich forests in the world outside of tropical rainforests. Alcoa’s research and monitoring has shown that there are approximately 300 plant species among the vegetation types in areas mined by the company.
The jarrah forest is classified as medium open forest on the basis of height and canopy density (10-30 m in height, 30-70% canopy cover). It is dominated by the jarrah tree, and marri (Corymbia calophylla) also occupies a large part of this area. In contrast to the floristic paucity of the tree strata, the jarrah forest floor is covered by a diverse sub-shrub and shrub layer to 2 m in height. The vegetation superficially appears uniform. More realistically, it forms a complex multi-dimensional continuum of overstory and understory species responding to a number of changing environmental variables.
The region is a centre of endemism for plants (e.g. Eucalyptus marginata), has a locally patchy biota despite the geological and geomorphic uniformity of the lateritic plateau, and is a refugia for many threatened species of flora and fauna. Rare or threatened species in the jarrah forest ecosystem include: orchids (Drakaea confluens, Caladenia bryceana subsp bryceana), birds (Muirs Corella, Western Whipbird, Western Bristlebird, Noisy Scrub-Bird), mammals (Potorous tridactylus gilbertii, and Isoodon obesulus, Dasyurus geoffroii, Parantechinus apicalis, Phascogale calura, P. tapoatafa, Setonix brachyurus, Myrmecobius fasciatus, Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi, Macropus eugenii derbianus and Pseudocheirus occidentalis), frogs (critically endangered Geocrinia alba and Geocrinia vitellina, Spicospina flammocaerulea) and the Baumea reed beds of freshwater wetland in forest areas. Alcoa’s general rehabilitation objective, after mining activities cease in a particular area, is to re-establish a self-sustaining jarrah forest ecosystem, planned to enhance or maintain water, timber, recreation, and conservation values.
A more specific target set for each restoration site is that “The average number of indigenous plant species in 15 month old rehabilitation is 100% of the number found in representative jarrah forest sites, with at least twenty percent of these from the recalcitrant species priority list.”

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Most research and rehabilitation activities are funded and carried out solely by Alcoa, although some projects have been performed with the involvement of universities and other research organizations.

Description of Project Activities: The ï¬rst step in the rehabilitation process is to batter down the pit walls and landscape the mines to blend into the surrounding forest topography. The overburden and topsoil are returned in the correct sequence, and the pit is then contour ripped to approximately 1.5 m using a winged ripping tine. Ripping with the winged tine encourages water inï¬ltration, reduces the risk of erosion, and relieves soil compaction that could restrict root growth. 

Following the earthworks, the areas are seeded with a mix that includes the two dominant tree species and approximately 50 to 90 species of the ground flora.  More than two tons of native seed are used annually mine restoration; all of this seed is collected within about 20 km from the mine where it is to be used.  Using local or ""˜provenance correct' seed ensures the genetic diversity of the restored areas is maintained.

There are many species where seed collecting and subsequent broadcasting is impractical, very expensive or even impossible.  For many of these, the natural seed in the returned topsoil is the best re-establishment option.  Research has led to the following recommendations to maximize the contribution of the topsoil seed store to restoration:

 - Strip and return the soil in the dry season (summer-autumn in this case)
 - Direct return the topsoil (don't stockpile it)
 - Rip in the dry season (summer-autumn)
 - Keep the top layers on the top (double strip and avoid burying topsoil during ripping)
 - Screen out some of the inert gravel fraction and apply the ""˜concentrated seed fraction' to areas that did not receive fresh topsoil.

Plant species that are not amenable to reestablishment from topsoil or broadcast seed are propagated by tissue culture or cuttings in Alcoa's Marrinup Nursery and planted in winter (200 - 500/ha). Those that are susceptible to grazing are guarded. Finally, 500 kg/ha of a fertilizer mix based on diammonium phosphate with added potassium and micronutrients is applied by helicopter in spring.

Early rehabilitation techniques involved planting exotic pine trees (e.g., Pinus pinaster) or eastern Australian eucalypt species in rows with no understory seeding. Sites rehabilitated after 1976 were seeded with an understory comprising mainly native legume species (e.g., Acacia pulchella, A. urophylla). In the early 1980s, rehabilitation sites were planted with a mix of native and eastern Australian dieback-resistant eucalypt species. It was unknown if jarrah dieback disease (caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi) would kill jarrah trees established in rehabilitated mine pits. However, research showed that the survival rate of jarrah in rehabilitated mine pits was high, irrespective of the presence of P. cinnamomi. Since 1988, a native overstory has been established in rehabilitation sites by seeding the indigenous forest dominants, jarrah and marri. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: All measured indicators show that our restored areas have the building blocks and processes in place to successfully re-instate the jarrah forest ecosystem.  There has been a continuous improvement in recovery results.  Paying careful attention to handling and timing of topsoil movement, developing and applying new technology, putting new initiatives in place, and improving the broadcast seed mix and its method of application saw a gradual improvement in species richness in mined plots to over 80% of unmined plots' richness  by 1995.  By further improving soil handling methods, improved seed technology, and by planting recalcitrant species, the target was exceeded and a value of 101.4%  was achieved at Alcoa mines in 2001 restored areas.  Late soil ripping in the wet season saw lower richness results for 2002 and 2003, and a very dry year in 2001 produced poor natural soil seedbanks which also affected richness in 2002 and 2003.  2004 achieved 96%, while 2005 again fell to 90% due to closure of a mining region and the subsequent lack of opportunities to carry out direct return of topsoil.  2006 results will be available at the end of 2007. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: As seen in the reduced richness measurements in 2002, 2003, and 2005, there are a number of variables that could be seen as factors limiting recovery, at least temporarily.  A very dry year in can affect natural soil seedbanks in following years, as can logistical restraints on the timing of soil ripping and topsoil return.  Directly returning topsoil to a rehabilitated area greatly increases botanical richness, but planning for direct topsoil return can be complex, and operational constraints can result in topsoil being stockpiled. Part of the challenge is to improve planning processes and to implement plans to maximize the direct return of topsoil. Improvements had to be made at all stages of rehabilitation. This involved refining existing practices, developing new practices, developing better mine planning tools, developing new technology and further increasing environmental commitment.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The intact jarrah forest has high conservation and biodiversity value, is the basis of a major sawmilling industry, and is widely used for recreation pursuits.

Considerations for the mining operation directly related to human well-being are water catchment protection, loss of timber production, and impacts on local communities such as noise, dust and access to forest.  All of these issues are addressed to some extent by a successful restoration effort.
Five important components of Alcoa’s approach to restoring the jarrah forest are worth noting:
– Identify opportunities to improve the number of plant species.
– Select research projects. Some projects were major investments, with the involvement of universities and other research organisations; other research took place solely within Alcoa.
– Build the infrastructure and equipment. In the development phase, infrastructure such as a micropropagation laboratory was built, and equipment such as mechanical seeders and large-scale soil screens were designed and constructed.
– Track changes to botanical richness. Monitoring occurred every year using a scientifically based sampling regime.
– Set clear targets. Stating an objective for the rehabilitated areas – to restore a functional jarrah forest ecosystem that matched the pre-mining land uses – was a significant step forward for the company.
The areas restored under this program are still young (mostly less than 30 years old) and full ecosystem restoration may take centuries. However, all measured indicators show that the areas restored under this program have the building blocks and processes in place to successfully re-instate the jarrah forest ecosystem. To measure and monitor botanical richness, Alcoa developed a rigorous, scientifically based sampling system to be performed annually. Each spring, when each rehabilitation area is 15 months old, fifty 80m2 plots are randomly placed at each mine. All local plant species in each plot are identified and counted, and identical control plots in the unmined forest adjacent to each mine are used to make the comparisons against. "

The majority of the work has been focused in the Greater Mount Trumbull Ecosystem within the Grand Canyon/Parashant National Monument. This innovative
collaboration between Department of Interior (BLM, NPS, BIA), state (Northern Arizona University, Game and Fish, State Forestry) has resulted in one of the foremost development and application sites for designing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating restoration-based hazardous fuel reduction
and ecological restoration projects. The work at Mount Trumbull represents an expansion and enhancement of collaborative partnerships and worked specifically in four project areas: piñon-juniper restoration, piñon-juniper herbaceous revegetation, cheatgrass abatement and monitoring, and ponderosa pine restoration.1. piñon-juniper restoration””although piñon-juniper woodlands form an important vegetation type on millions of acres of Federal lands, surprisingly little research and testing has been done to restore degraded, fire-susceptible habitats. BLM and ERI designed and implemented piñon-juniper restoration and fuels management experiments in association with the Greater Grand Canyon/Parashant Ecosystem and related sites. The experimental sites
include treatment and control areas, with permanent plots to measure vegetation and fuels. The range of natural variation (reference conditions) of the piñon-juniper forest structure is being established and used to guide treatment design.2. Piñon-juniper herbaceous revegetation””experimental trials to revitalize the native plant community and stabilize soils through increased plant cover. This work was designed to monitor, implement, and evaluate alternative methods of plant community restoration, utilizing by-products of thinning treatments such as slash and mulch. The efficacy of seeding and soil amendments is being contrasted in a controlled, two-factor study. Evaluation and monitoring results will be useful for large areas of piñon-juniper woodlands on the Arizona Strip and the Colorado Plateau.3. Cheatgrass abatement and monitoring- Cheatgrass is a serious symptom of poor land health. Cheatgrass out competes valuable forage and increases the risk of wildfire. This project will monitor the response of cheatgrass to different management scenarios and analyze the role of the biophysical environment to its spread. The goal is to provide management recommendations to land managers and other stakeholders that will help avoid ongoing and future invasion by cheatgrass.4. Ponderosa Pine Restoration and Hazardous Fuel Reduction Monitoring- permanent monitoring plots in restoration-treated and control landscapes were re-measured in 2005, five years after the completion of thinning and burning treatments. Changes in forest structure, large tree mortality, tree growth, regeneration, and fuels were assessed.Agriculture & Livestock, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Mining & Resource Extraction, Other With the widespread arrival of the Mormon settlements in the 1870s large-scale grazing completely altered the abundance of grasslands in the region. The elimination of fine fuels by grazing immediately altered the fire regime of the region, eliminating an essential component for fires to move across the landscape. Continued fire exclusion through the late twentieth century coupled with continued grazing during that time was responsible for the extensive growth of small-diameter ponderosa that choked the forests by the 1990s. The Uinkarets are distant from anything, even today, and as a consequence saw little early impact on the overall structure of the ponderosa forests found there because of logging. The distance and lack of infrastructure or rail links precluded widespread logging, although in the late 1800s small-scale logging operations were undertaken, providing some larger logs for the Mormon temple in St. George, Utah. Few ponderosa piness larger than 50″ in diameter were extracted at the time because of the limitations of the saws being operated. However, once truck logging took off in the early 1900s the Uinkarets saw significant timber extraction. The elimination of fuels and then continued fire suppression can best be seen with the data that in pre-settlement times tree density has been figured at 32-40 trees per acre, while forest density was 280 to 1200 trees per acre by the 1990s. Another consequence of the extensive growth of small-diameter ponderosa were marked decreases in both plant abundance and diversity. In the piñon-juniper woodlands aerial photography taken in the 1940s and again in the 1990s indicated significant encroachment of the overstory trees which had a marked influence on the abundance of understory vegetation. Various lines of evidence, including these historical and contemporary aerial photographs, diameter and age distributions, and dendrochronological reconstructions indicated a transition from previously more open stand conditions existing in the late 1800s to closed conditions found in the 1990s. These changes appear to be linked to intensive livestock grazing, exclusion of naturally occurring fire, and climate. Site characteristics suggested degradation of ecological integrity in two main forms: (1) low plant species diversity with communities dominated by dense pinyon and juniper overstories; (2) reduced soil O horizons, particularly in intercanopy openings. The historic structure of the ecosystem mirrored that of most semi-arid ponderosa ecosystems in the southwestern United States, with widespread grassland understory vegetation coupled with open, park-like forests of ponderosa pines. The old-growth ponderosa often exceeded 30 meters in height and there was a significant component of oak scattered throughout. The ecosystem is a mixture of Great Basin cold desert species like piñon pine and sagebrush with more ponderosa, oak, and blue grama. Growing in elevation driven bands of vegetation, the lower elevations of the Uinkarets were dominated by piñon-juniper woodlands. These woodlands were likely less dense than contemporary woodlands and had a higher abundance of grasses and forbs. The forest restoration prescription in the ponderosa pine forest was designed to rapidly emulate the historic forest structure, pre-dating European settlement and fire exclusion that began around 1870. In the later piñon-juniper restoration the objective of the project was to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in reducing stand density to levels similar to presettlement conditions and increasing understory diversity, and to look at the constraints and limitations that might hinder similar restoration attempts.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Arizona Strip, which surrounds and includes the Uinkaret Mountains, is largely managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). In 2000, President Clinton designated part of the Uinkarets as part of the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, leaving the management of the monument to the BLM. In 1995, the Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern Arizona University initiated the collaboration with both the BLM and the Arizona Game and Fish Department. The underlying interest in the overall project was to reduce the severe wildfire danger posed by the explosive growth of the ponderosa pine trees since Euro-American settlement and restore historic reference conditions.

Description of Project Activities: Four experimental blocks were established, representing the heterogeneity of the landscape in terms of vegetation, topography, and past management history.  Each block was divided into two units, randomly assigned to be either a control or restoration treatment. Briefly, block 1 (EB1) was dominated by ponderosa pine on shallow lava soils.  Block 2 included abundant Gambel oak on basalt-derived clay soils.  Block 3 was pine-oak forest at the highest elevation on cinder soils.  Block 4 consisted of dense, young ponderosa trees and some pinyon (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), on basalt-derived clay soils.  New Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana) was scattered across most of the units. Twenty permanent monitoring plots were established in each control and treatment area, for a total of 40 plots per experimental block. Overstory trees taller than breast height (4.5 ft) were tagged and measured on a fixed-area plot.  Measurements included species, diameter at breast height (dbh), and condition class Trees below breast height and shrubs were tallied by condition and height classes on a nested subplot.  Dead woody biomass and forest floor depth were measured on a 49.9 ft planar transect in a random direction from each plot center. As they proceeded to the treatment phase, all living trees predating 1870 were retained.  Wherever evidence of pre-1870 remnant conifer material was encountered (i.e., snags, logs, stumps, stump holes), three younger trees of the same species within a 30-60 ft radius were selected as replacements. Fire-susceptible deciduous species, oak and locust, were not thinned.  Thinning was carried out by commercial contractors and BLM crews in 1999.  Block 4 was so dense that not all the trees marked for retention could be safely thinned and burned. Slash was lopped and scattered. Deep duff layers were raked 1-3 ft away from boles of all pre-1870 trees and snags.  Treatment units were burned in the winter of 1999-2000. All plots were remeasured in May-July, 2000, and five years later, May-June, 2005.   Measurements of tree height and crown base height were added, and crown scorch and bole char were measured. 

In the piñon-juniper restoration, ERI based their restoration treatment on an approach described by Jacobs and Gatewood (1999, 2002), because of their demonstrated success at reestablishing understory diversity in a piñon-juniper ecosystem of New Mexico.  The process entailed thinning trees to low densities, scattering slash, and seeding with native grasses. ERI modified the prescription, however, in order to focus on restoring site-specific overstory density and spatial arrangement.  Additionally, it was desired to establish a broad array of understory life forms (i.e., grasses as well as forbs and shrubs). The treatment implemented on restoration units was the following: 1) thin piñon and juniper trees less than 25 cm DRC, except for trees retained to replace presettlement evidence (i.e., dead tree structures >25 cm DRC) at a 2:1 ratio by species; 2) lop slash to 1 m (3.3 ft) or less in length and scatter material to cover bare soil; 3) seed with native plant species.  Using tree increment cores, linear regression of establishment date and DRC data suggested that piñon pine trees less than 25 cm DRC were likely to be less than 130 years of age and therefore postsettlement in origin. Age-diameter relationships for juniper were and cores did not cross-date well.  Retaining two postsettlement-aged trees to replace each dead presettlement structure was used as a conservative approach to restoring historical densities and also allowed for posttreatment mortality.  Selection of replacement was based on species, size, form, and proximity to structure being replaced.  Thinning was completed November, 2003. Selection of native plant species for seeding was based on observations of local occurrence, baseline data from belt transects, and community data reported in relict site literature. ERI researchers selected four common grasses, one forb, and four shrub species. Grasses: Bouteloua curtipendula ,Bouteloua gracilis, Elymus elymoides, Oryzopsis hymenoides, Sporobolis cryptandrus  Forbs: Lupinus argenteus  Shrubs: Amelanchier utahensis, Atriplex canescens,  Ephedra viridis, Rhus trilobata. Researchers broadcasted the seed at a rate that approximated common standards for range rehabilitation. However, they chose to seed both in early spring and late summer in order accommodate germination and establishment requirements for both cool and warm season species.  Using site preparation methods such as plowing or disking before seeding was not feasible.  Nor did they harrow or rake the restoration units after the seed was broadcast, but instead utilized thinning slash to provide cover and mulch for the seeds. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Five years after completion of the initial phase of forest restoration treatments at Mt. Trumbull, forest structure was substantially altered by tree mortality.  Many of the changes were not statistically significant, however. Basal area, tree density, and canopy cover in the treated units declined not only in the immediate treatment period but also in the subsequent five years. Declining tree density per se was not inconsistent with the treatment objectives because a surplus of ponderosa pine trees was retained.  Compared to pre-fire-exclusion reference conditions (1870), basal areas in the treatment units were still >100% or more higher in 2005 indicating that the thinning prescription left an adequate margin of replacement trees. Although tree mortality in general does not necessarily constitute a problem, mortality of larger and older ponderosa pine trees is of concern, because these trees form important habitat elements, conserve genetic diversity over centuries, contribute to aesthetic qualities of the forest, and simply take a long time to replace. Future development of forest structure will depend on the balance between continued mortality, growth of surviving trees, and new regeneration.  Lingering effects of treatment-related damage may cause additional mortality, but most studies of fire-caused mortality indicate that the great majority of deaths are evident within 3 years after fire so it is expect that future mortality in the treated units would not differ from that in the controls. Regeneration was highly skewed toward sprouting species, which commonly respond vigorously to disturbance and may come to dominate the forest, although they are susceptible to fire and can be controlled with repeated burning. Since ponderosa seed trees remain well distributed across the Mt. Trumbull experimental sites and duff depth was significantly reduced by treatment, facilitating pine seedling establishment, it is likely that ponderosa regeneration will be successful in the coming years. The findings of post-treatment mortality and limited pine regeneration may be applied to suggest changes in treatment methods.  For valued and vulnerable ecosystem components such as old trees, it would be useful to adopt any practices that might reduce the stress of treatment activities. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: An extended and severe drought period emerged from 1996 to 2002 and even under these difficult circumstances, however, overall forest structural impacts were relatively controlled, suggesting that restoration treatments may help pine-oak, and piñon-juniper forests persist through climatic shifts. An unintended response to these restoration treatments was a rapid expansion of nonnative cheatgrass into the treated areas.  This invasion occurred between the summers of 2002 and 2003.  There are two additional factors that might be relevant to the invasion of cheatgrass at Mt. Trumbull.  First, the summer of 2002 was a severe drought year.  Second, cattle were reintroduced onto Mt. Trumbull that same summer for the first time since the initiation of the restoration treatments. Throughout much of the treated landscape, cheatgrass has become the dominant understory species.  Cheatgrass infestations of this magnitude and extent have not been documented in any other Southwestern ponderosa pine site, even following severe wildfires. However, within the matrix of cheatgrass domination, there remain patches of native-dominated vegetation. Data suggest that a narrow suite of native species are dominating these remnant patches.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: This work explicitly served the stated goals of both the Clinton and Bush Administrations, the Department of Interior, the Bureau of Land Management, the Healthy Forest Initiative, Healthy Forest Act, National Fire Plan, and Western Governor's 10-year Comprehensive Strategy by developing the scientific basis for restoration-based hazardous fuel reduction and transferring that knowledge to the various stakeholders responsible for developing treatments.  The large-scale nature of the project allowed for extrapolation to larger ecosystems and has become influential in planning across the western United States.
The findings of post-treatment mortality and limited pine regeneration may be applied to suggest changes in treatment methods. For valued and vulnerable ecosystem components such as old trees, it would be useful to adopt any practices that might reduce the stress of treatment activities.
Even though ERI found no correlation between delayed mortality and heat effects (canopy scorch, bole char), prescribed burning of broadcast slash has been experimentally linked with tree death in other Mt. Trumbull study sites. This source of damage can be controlled by slash compression before burning or by removing or piling slash. A possible approach to the death of big trees would be to retain additional large trees during thinning, either through raising the ratio of replacement trees or through a diameter cap on cutting. However, there are tradeoffs to consider, because the spatial pattern of restoration thinning was designed to emulate the clumpy pattern of pre-fire-exclusion forests. One ERI researcher presented a stem-mapped example from the Mt. Trumbull area to illustrate how the selection of young replacement trees within a specified radius of remnant pre-1870 material resulted in the retention of trees close to where tree patches had been before as well as the re-opening of historical forest gaps. Understory plant productivity in such gaps can reach orders of magnitude higher than productivity under trees. Since the biggest trees within the search radius were already the ones selected for retention, a rule specifying retention of more large trees would inevitably result in crowding or eliminating many gaps. The thinning guidelines already successfully discriminated between pre-1870 and younger trees, conserving the former category, and retained trees displayed high growth rates.
In the case of the piñon-juniper restoration there is still much that is not known regarding the historic ecosystem structure and dynamics at the two piñon-juniper sites at Grand-Canyon Parashant Monument, the implemented treatment appeared to be effective at reducing stand density and altering overstory species composition to levels more characteristic of the late 1800s. The treatment was also an attempt to gain conditions generally desired by Bureau of Land Management staff and the public. These conditions included a productive, diverse plant community, reduced fuel hazard, and conservation of large, old piñon and juniper trees. Results indicated that live canopy fuel levels were reduced, which likely reduced crown fire hazard. Old trees were also conserved. These additional goals represent a balance between strict-sense emulation of historical patterns and consideration of present human values. Taken as whole, therefore, this experiment can be described as a “good” restoration. The only planned future treatment for the experimental units in ponderosa pine is repeated prescribed burning. Concern about the possibility of additional damage to old trees must be weighed against the role of surface fire in thinning the fire-susceptible oak and locust sprouts. Although in an idealized situation it might be attractive to view fire as the natural agent for maintaining open forest structure with minimal human guidance, the Mt. Trumbull forest is still quite removed from reference conditions and prescribed burns differ in many ways from the free-burning wildfires of the past. Therefore it may make sense for managers to use fire gently by minimizing it near vulnerable old trees, perhaps focusing on thinning sprouting trees with spot or ring ignition patterns. Continued monitoring will be essential for evaluating the progress of the restoration activity. In most respects, the results have been positive in terms of forest structure, except for the undesired mortality of a relatively high proportion of large pine trees and the low level of pine regeneration.
In pinyon-juniper ecosystems, plant community development is relatively slow and five to ten years is a likely minimum time over which to monitor treatment effects. Permanent plots established in the study allow for future measurements to be conducted and more definitive evaluations to be made concerning these restoration goals. "

The first effort was undertaken from February 1995 through June 1996, and involved the testing of restoration methods and procedures at the Vertical Short Takeoff and Landing (VSTOL) site. The second effort conducted under this five year program, begun in 1996 and conducted jointly with the Soil Ecology and Restoration Group (SERG) at San Diego State University (SDSU), involved the testing of restoration and revegetation methods and procedures on a heavily disturbed tank trail. The results from the Tank Trail research confirmed the use of ripping as an inexpensive method for narrow, moderately disturbed areas, such as dirt roads and parking lots, also seen in the original VSTOL restoration project. This method, combined with imprinting and direct seeding of large disturbed areas, can provide a low cost, efficient method of revegetating disturbed desert site within the MCAGCC. However, the low survival rates experienced during the first two years of the Tank Trail project, compared to the extremely high survival rates of the initial VSTOL project, highlight the impact and importance of the El Niño phenomenon to desert restoration. As part of an effort to develop revegetation procedures for the VSTOL runway, SERG also designed an experiment to determine the effect of changing the C:N ratio in disturbed soils using a variety of soil treatments and the addition of ammonium nitrate. The results of this experiment suggested that the addition of fertilizers on disturbed soils as a plant growth enhancer is impractical, and, although not apparent during this experiment, will probably benefit nonnative plant species more than native plant species.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The first and third studies under this five year program took place at the VSTOL site, an abandoned landing strip with runways and aircraft parking areas treated with Soil Sement, which forms a hard concrete-like surface. The area adjacent to the restoration site has a fairly loose, sandy substrate, while the site itself suffers from extreme compaction through both the impact of wheeled vehicles and the use of Soil Sement to help build the aircraft runway and taxi areas.
The second study involved the testing of restoration and revegetation methods and procedures on a heavily disturbed tank trail. This tank trail had become unnecessarily wide and was increasingly encroaching on adjacent undisturbed creosote bush scrub habitat. The site suffers from extreme compaction with a top layer (2-10 cm deep) of extremely fine dust caused by the weight of both wheeled and track vehicles over many years of use. Even under a harsh climatic regime, there is a wide diversity of flora and fauna at MCAGCC. In addition to the Mojave species, many species of plants and animals common to the Sonoran Desert are found interspersed with more northerly species. The Tank Trail site is located alongside an area that is dominated by creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) and white bursage (Ambrosia dumosa), typical Mojave Desert scrub habitat. The Mojave is also home to many rare endemic species. Floristically, 25% of the species are endemic (found nowhere else), with annuals exhibiting 80% endemism. Seven rare plant species have been identified and an equal number are suspected to occur at MCAGCC. MCAGCC has at least 240 vertebrate species, birds comprising the majority of the aforementioned. Approximately 169 of the bird species are neotropical migrants which pass through MCAGCC during spring and fall migrations.
The Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) is MCAGCC’s only species federally listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended. The desert tortoise is also a state listed species. The Swainson’s hawk (Buteo swainsoni), Gilded flicker (Colaptes chrysoides), Bell’s vireo (Vireo bellii), Willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii) and the Golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) are State listed species which have been observed at MCAGCC. All, with the possible exception of the Golden eagle, are seasonal migrants. The purpose of this study was to test various procedures such as site preparation, soil manipulation, irrigation methods, and plant protection to develop the most efficient methods for the restoration of native plant communities throughout the base. These techniques could be used to create suitable desert tortoise habitat on the base, while simultaneously controlling erosion and dust.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
This project was initiated by the National Resources and Environmental Affairs Directorate (NREA) at the MCAGCC as an effort to develop and test methods of native plant revegetation in disturbed areas while simultaneously controlling erosion and dust. The project was carried out by MCAGCC, along with the SERG at SDSU.

Description of Project Activities: Pilot Study

Three plots were established: the Tower Plot to test procedures to be used for restoration of areas disturbed by vehicle use such as roads and staging areas; the Runway Plot to test procedures for use on areas heavily disturbed by construction of the actual runways and aircraft parking areas; and an Undisturbed Plot located outside the VSTOL site to use for comparative analysis. Both disturbed plots were ripped, contoured and planted with seedlings grown from locally collected seeds. Seedlings in both plots were randomly selected to receive a plant protective device or to serve as a control. The Runway Plot was treated with wood chips to reestablish the impacted mineralization system, while the Tower Plot seedlings received either deep pipe or surface irrigation methods.

Results demonstrated that the type of irrigation received did affect seedling growth, depending on the species involved. The addition of a soil amendment (wood chips) showed no effect, though previous experiments have shown results after two growing seasons.  Numerous volunteers were seen on the Tower Plot and no volunteer plants were seen on the Runway Plot, demonstrating the lack of a viable seed bank in the heavily impacted area.

Unit One

To investigate different soil preparation techniques, half of the experimental quadrats were ripped to reduce soil compaction, and half were not ripped. Within these quadrats, some sections were imprinted, some were pitted and some left untreated to serve as controls. Once the soil preparations were complete, half of each treated area was seeded using a mix of native seeds.  Bark mulch was applied to randomly selected quadrats. It was anticipated that mulched areas would enhance seed germination, catch organic matter, and increase water retention.  A portion of the ripped and unripped quadrats were planted with Larrea tridentata and Ambrosia dumosa. 

Since the conventional watering regime yielded an average survival of only 13% for the 1996 plantings, replanting was conducted in March and April 1997.  Three experimental irrigation treatments were implemented:  flood irrigation into a watering basin, flood irrigation into a watering basin lined with a layer of punched straw mulch, and diffusion irrigation using porous ceramic capsules.

In January 1998, a portion of the Tank Trail site was again replanted. The supplemental irrigation methods were abandoned and replaced with shallow basins. The different irrigation methods which had been applied to these plants at the original replanting in March and April 1997 had become irrelevant over time due to the loss of straw mulch to wind, and because the five-gallon reservoir systems had proven ineffective in the long term due to a lack of durability and a tendency to become clogged.

Overall survival in the Unit One plantings was 78%. There was a significantly higher coverage of non-seeded native species in the ripped areas than in the non-ripped plots. There was a significantly greater number and coverage of seeded native plants, and lower number of nonnative species, in the imprinted plots compared to both the pitted and control plots.  There was a higher percent cover of seeded native plants, a greater number of non-seeded natives, and a greater number and coverage of nonnative plants in the non-mulched plots.

Twenty-four mesquite mounds, approx. 6 ft. high and 12-15 ft. long, were constructed in February 1996.  Half of the mounds were constructed on a non-ripped section of the trail, and half on a ripped section. Six mesquite seedlings (Prosopis glandulosa) were planted on each mound. Due to low survivorship, the mesquite mounds were replanted twice from 1996 to 1997.  In the first replanting, each seedling received Driwater placed in contact with the root zone, and a large volume deep pipe to facilitate and improve the effectiveness of future watering.  Driwater was not used in the second replanting.  A small area within the mesquite mounds was used to compare the survival of three native species, each with and without native mycorrhizal inoculum. Species used were Hymenoclea salsola, Atriplex canescens and Encelia farinosa.

Survival in the mesquite mounds was 67%, with no significant difference in survival between the ripped south section and the non-ripped north section.  80% of the original plants in the mycorrhizal study survived, and a significantly higher number of inoculated Atriplex canescens plants died than did non-inoculated A. canescens.  

Unit Two

This area was planted in October 1997, using a variety of irrigation methods.  The initial planting used a series of 55 gallon containers with sections of irrigation tubing extending from near the bottom of each container.  Each section of tubing was branched, with each branch terminating in a ceramic capsule buried near the root zone of each plant. 

In the next planting, a three inch diameter flexible perforated plastic pipe was used as the water delivery medium. The intent was to experiment with providing water below ground where it would be both needed and less susceptible to evaporation.

In a natural basin area in Unit Two, ten Chilopsis linearis (Desert willow) were planted without supplemental irrigation. This is a wash-inhabiting species that tends to do relatively well in low-lying areas which collect water. In an extension of this idea, a group of catchments were created near the center of Unit Two.  Each catchment consisted of two berms forming a water collection point at the low corner of each. 

The last planting in Unit Two used a variety of irrigation devices, including deep pipes of both 2 and 4 inch widths, deep pipes with ceramic containers attached at the bottom, ceramic containers alone, and controls which received no treatment. 

The watering regime was typically every three weeks, never exceeding one month between waterings except during the wet season (November through March). The gravity feed system had a survival rate of 81%, and the perforated pipe section had a survival rate of 87%.  80% of Chilopsis plants planted together in the basin area survived, 100% of the catchment plants survived, and 79% of the group of plants with various individual watering mechanisms survived.

Vertical Short Take-off and Landing (VSTOL) Site Nitrogen Study

This experiment consisted of three plots, each containing four soil treatments; alfalfa straw mulch, wheat straw mulch, sawdust mulch and a control. The different mulch materials represent a gradient in carbon:nitrogen ratios. Half of each plot was also fertilized with Ammonium nitrate.  Within each of these eight subplots, four Ambrosia dumosa were planted.  Each subplot was seeded over a one meter square area with both native and exotic seeds.  The data collected included soil nitrogen levels above and below ground levels. Nitrate and ammonium levels were measured in each subplot.

Ten months after planting, overall survivorship of Ambrosia dumosa at the VSTOL site was 78%. Soil treatments had no significant effect on plant survivorship, height, NO3 or percent moisture. Soil treatments did have a significant effect on the other dependent variables: higher NH4 in the alfalfa plots; higher percent organic matter in the soil amended plots; and higher pH in the control plots. With the exception of one Isomeris arborea, no seedlings were observed growing in the seeded areas. 
Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The principal limiting factor in this project is the availability of water.  The low survival rates experienced during the first two years of the Tank Trail project, compared to the extremely high survival rates of the initial VSTOL project, highlight the impact and importance of precipitation and the El Niño phenomenon to desert restoration. If low-cost methods can be scheduled for completion during years that are predicted to experience an El Niño winter with its above average precipitation, then the survival rates will probably be well above acceptable minimums. If such efforts are accomplished during La Niña years, then survival rates will be greatly reduced.

There has not been enough time, as of yet, to accurately analyze the effects of adding mulch to a restoration site. Though previous research has shown mulch to be of benefit to the reestablishment of native shrubs in slightly more mesic habitats, the lack of rainfall and moisture at Twenty-nine Palms appear to have slowed down the mineralization rate of the recalcitrant mulch to where any benefit will not be apparent for quite some time. As such, it appears that the one noticeable effect the mulch has had on the Tank Trail restoration site has been to prohibit the germination of seedlings, from both direct seeding and windblown seeds.
Results from the Tank Trail experiments demonstrate the benefits of ripping a compacted area to enhance the site’s ability to revegetate. By reducing the soil strength through ripping, both water infiltration and soil mineralization increases and a plant’s ability to move its roots through the soil improves. It is highly recommended that any site suffering from heavy compaction be thoroughly ripped before any other restoration activity is conducted. In certain situations, such as heavily used but narrow roadways, ripping may be all that is required, with volunteer seedlings becoming established on the site from nearby seed sources.
Tank Trail results also indicate that imprinting a large area in preparation for direct seeding can greatly improve both initial germination and overall success rates. The shallow depressions formed by the imprinter apparently enhance a direct seeding effort, but do not seem to aid in the establishment of native volunteer seedlings. It is recommended that any restoration effort that is to rely on direct seeding as the primary source of revegetation include the use of an imprinter during site preparations. If the imprinting and seeding effort can be timed to occur during a wet winter season, results should be excellent with a minimum of money and effort being expended.
Mesquite seedlings suffered heavily from initial die-off and were slow to become established. The primary reason for this problem is believed to be the timing of the mounds’ construction and planting. The first group of mesquite seedlings were planted during the La Niña season of 1996-97, with little subsequent rainfall. This not only led to large die-off of seedlings, but little growth of those that survived. It was only during the wet 1997-98 winter season that any growth was noted. Those seedlings that survived and have demonstrated a belated growth spurt have been the ones with deep pipe irrigation systems. Dri-water and surface irrigation was not successful on the mesquite mounds.
The use of perforated pipe as a method to deliver water to native seedlings has shown to be the most efficient and least expensive irrigation procedure tested so far. Survival rates were greater with perforated pipe than other methods, and the system has been virtually maintenance free. The only change recommended is to use solid pipe and punch the drip holes into the pipe at specific locations near the newly planted seedlings, so that water will be delivered only to those points. Though ceramic capsules appear to have excellent possibilities, problems with loose fittings and system leaks have yet to be overcome. The use of catchments for groups of plants appears to be a successful method of irrigation, and can lead to high seedling survival rates, but is not the most efficient use of water. Much is lost to evaporation during the hot summer months when water is most necessary. Due to the need for such large amounts of water, the use of catchments is recommended only for small restoration efforts located near an available source of water. It is recommended that data continue to be collected on the mulch plots to determine if the benefits may appear over a longer period, and that the mesquite mounds continue to be monitored to determine if those seedlings that survived and have shown growth over this last year will continue to develop into the type of well covered mounds that once thrived over much of the Twenty-nine Palms area. Continued research should also be done on the use of ceramic capsule irrigation systems; with further experimentation, ceramic capsules may yet prove to be a cost efficient irrigation method for desert restoration.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-arizona-gus-pearson-natural-area-restoration/	USA: Arizona: Gus Pearson Natural Area Restoration	United States of America	1992-01-01	2014-01-01	"Initiated in 1992 with National Science Foundation funding, the Gus Pearson Natural Area Restoration was an experimental project of Nothern Arizona University’s Ecological Restoration Institute and is located approximately 7 miles (20 km) northwest of Flagstaff, AZ. The original experiment’s aim was to compare three treatments: 1) tree thinning to emulate predisruption forest structure, followed by fuel reduction and prescribed burning (composite); 2) tree thinning only, without fire (thinning); and 3) control. The study also attempted to examine the response of the treatments to different “patch types” at the site, including presettlement stands, postsettlement stands, and remnant grassy patches. GPNA is the site of the Ecological Restoration Institute’s oldest ecological restoration treatments utilizing thinning of small trees to emulate presettlement forest structure prior to reintroducing low-intensity fire (though the study site itself had to be decommissioned as a part of the GPNA to allow for cutting trees).Mining & Resource Extraction, Other Aside from some light logging in 1894, the site has never been commercially harvested, and so it retained its complement of mature ponderosa pines, as well as a dense growth of young pines originating from the seed crop of 1919. The absence of logging and the growth of young pines caused an accumulation of excessive fuel loads, creating hazardous fire conditions. Open, park like ponderosa forest with well-developed grassland and frequent low intensity fire regime. The natural area originated as a control site, a remnant of virgin forest to be used for comparison against other studies in the Fort Valley Experimental Forest. The site was heavily grazed by domestic livestock prior to the establishment of the station, which caused the interruption of the fire regime. The goal of the composite treatment was to recreate as closely as possible the structure and function of a ponderosa pine forest prior to Euro-American settlement and the initiation of fire exclusion (about 1876), and the small size of the project area allowed for the use of relatively labor-intensive methods to effect this result. The original experiment’s aim was to compare three treatments: 1) tree thinning to emulate predisruption forest structure, followed by fuel reduction and prescribed burning (composite); 2) tree thinning only, without fire (thinning); and 3) control. The study also attempted to examine the response of the treatments to different “patch types” at the site, including presettlement stands, postsettlement stands, and remnant grassy patches.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The United States Forest Service and specifically the Coconino National Forest owns Gus Pearson Natural Area, the Rocky Mountain Research Station, and the School of Forestry at Northern Arizona University. By the early 1990s the Forest Service had become increasingly concerned about increasing fuel loads and decreasing forest health in the ponderosa pine forest type. The Forest Service decommissioned a small area as a firebreak adjacent to the buildings of the experimental station when the project was initiated.

Description of Project Activities: First most of the small, postsettlement trees were cut and removed from the site, with some left to replace trees which had died or been cut since 1876.  Recent leaf litter was raked aside, and the accumulated duff from the past century was removed, then the recent litter was replaced.  Finally, to replicate the composition of fine fuels which would have been in place in presettlement times, native grass hay from nearby Hart Prairie was collected and scattered across the site before burning.  The composite units were burned in the fall of 1994, and have since been repeatedly burned on a four-year rotation.  The thinning units received the same level of tree thinning, but had none of the forest floor manipulation, and of course were not burned. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: More than a decade after the treatments were completed, the composite and thinning treatments appear to have made substantial recovery towards the structure and functioning of an undisturbed presettlement ponderosa pine forest.  The mixture of large, yellow-bark pines and young, vigorous blackjacks in clumps across the site approximates the structure of the original forest, and the open spaces between clumps are dense with native grasses (including squirreltail, mountain muhly, Arizona fescue, and pine dropseed) and forbs (such as American vetch, Wheeler's thistle, and silvery lupine).  The strongest response in the understory vegetation was seen in the patches where all the young postsettlement trees were removed. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The project at Gus Pearson was driven by a desire on the part of Forest Service managers and scientists to develop methods to apply management techniques on larger landscape scales.  Because of its small size (4 hectares) the work at Gus Pearson Natural Area was able to accomplish significant restoration that required detailed labor-intensive methods.  The applicability of such intensive methods on larger scales has always been a question for researchers.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: By exploring solutions to the health crisis in southwestern ponderosa pine forests, the Gus Pearson project set researchers on a path toward successful ecological restoration techniques in these ponderosa forests.  Restoration experiments have provided a scientific basis for political decisions being made by forest managers to thin areas in Urban-Wildland interface in similar forest types for fire protection.  In nearby Flagstaff, Arizona, the experiments at Gus Pearson provided necessary understanding to encourage strategic thinning projects to protect the city from the threat of wildfire.
While originally conceived of as a project for fire protection, the restoration experiment was developed in part because of the results from the interval burning studies. Other projects in the area in the 1980s and early 1990s suggested that prescribed fire alone was insufficient to restore presettlement forest structure, indicating that additional thinning and then raking of the extensive litter layer away from the bases of large trees would be required. Research at this experimental site has generated valuable insights about stand age structure and the effects of restoration treatments. Fifteen years after thinning, old ponderosa pine trees in the stand continue to respond positively in terms of leaf physiology and insect resistancee. Herbaceous understory vegetation has responded to restoration treatments but the responses differ between patches in the open and under the canopy and among functional groups and species. Other studies have examined the effects of treatments and patch types on soil chemistry, nutrient fluxes, and soil microbes. The long-term strategy is to try to maintain the experiment by maintaining the fenced exclosure, maintain the no-treatment/no-disturbance status of the control area, and burn the thin + burn treatment every 4 years indefinitely into the future.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/jordan-restoring-the-azraq-oasis-wetlands/	Jordan: Restoring the Azraq Oasis Wetlands	Jordan	1994-01-19	1997-01-19	"The Azraq Oasis in Jordan’s Badia region is a unique mosaic of wetland ecosystems set in the middle of an arid desert. As the only such source of permanent freshwater within some 12,000 km2, the oasis provides crucial habitat for a multitude of avifaunal species, and is an indispensable part of the local economy. Increasing populations in the nearby cities of Amman and Zarqa, along with growing demands from the agricultural sector, have resulted in the intensive exploitation of water from the oasis and the near-total destruction of its ecosystems. Upon the complete cessation of flows from the four main springs feeding the oasis, the Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan solicited UNDP/GEF funds to begin a restoration project. Flows were restored to the site in June 1994, albeit greatly reduced, and re-establishment of wetland revegetation began shortly thereafter. To promote a more expeditious and complete recovery, local land managers took steps to exclude the site from harmful grazing activities and develop a management plan that would outline strategies for more efficient use of scarce water resources. Recovery of the site has proceeded gradually, and monitoring surveys have indicated an increase in terrestrial vegetation, aquatic vegetation, aquatic insects, and avifauna. Despite optimism garnered by the resurrection of the Azraq wetlands, socioeconomic and demographic factors continue to demand more water, and the future of the site remains uncertain.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The Azraq wetlands have been heavily over-exploited as a result of escalating water needs for agriculture, industrial development, tourism, and urban growth. Ever-increasing demands for water, particularly in the rapidly growing city of Amman, have precipitated large-scale pumping from the Azraq Basin. In fact, pumping for urban needs increased from about two million cubic meters (m3) in 1979 to about 25 million m3 in 1993. Furthermore, a huge expansion in agriculture in the region has drained an additional 25 million m3 per year from the basin. This level of exploitation is approximately double the annual natural recharge rate of 25 million m3 per year, and has had a devastating impact on the wetlands.
Discharge from the four main springs that feed the reserve fell rapidly during the 1980s (from 10.5 million m3/year in 1981 to less than 1 million m3/year in 1991), and in 1987, the two northern springs dried up completely. The southern springs ceased flowing in August 1992, and by December 1992, the wetlands were completely dry. Marsh vegetation died off, and slow-burning fires began moving through the ground in areas that were formerly deep swamps. The groundwater level dropped by 20m, and in 1993 and 1994, the spring-fed pools were almost dry too.
The intensive exploitation of water resources has further jeopardized ecosystem function and biodiversity by causing salinization of the basin. Growing pockets of saline waters exist adjacent to freshwater, and studies have demonstrated that a continuation of pumping at the present rate will most probably lead to the salinization of the entire basin.
In spite of the ecological impacts already witnessed, the low per capita water availability in Jordan (less than 160 m3/year), coupled with population growth, has meant continuing exploitation of water from the Azraq Basin. Consequently, groundwater levels continue to drop at a rate of 0.5-1 m/year. The Azraq Oasis is designated a RAMSAR Wetland of International Importance and an Important Birds Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. Until recently, the wetlands comprised a large complex of spring-fed marshes and seasonally flooded mudflats covering about 12,000 ha. The three principal systems were as follows: (1) a small area of freshwater marshes fed by two springs near the village of Druze or North Azraq in the northwest (31051 ‘N, 36Â°50’E); (2) a large area of fresh to brackish marshes and pools fed by two large springs near the village of Shishan or South Azraq in the west (31Âº49’N, 36Â°49’E); (3) a large seasonally or intermittently flooded mudflat or playa wetland (Qa Al Azraq) in the east (31Âº50’N, 36Â°53’E). Streams carried water from the main spring pools at Shishan eastwards towards the playa, creating extensive shallow wetlands with a variety of habitats.
The once extensive spring-fed marshes contained a variety of habitats, including dense stands of Juncus maritimus, Carex sp., Typha angustifolia, Phragmites communis, Scirpus sp., Cyperus sp. and Arundo donax, and shallow pools with Ruppia sp. Nitraria and Tamarix communities occurred in the silty dunes between the streams and pools. The permanently wet areas around the artesian borehole support a small area of Tamarix bushes surrounded by wet marshes and meadows. The fishponds are fringed with Phragmites reeds. The playa is largely devoid of vegetation, except for a fringe of succulent halophytes such as Halopeplis sp. and Halocnemum sp. When the playa is flooded, there is abundant production of zooplankton, phytoplankton and some filamentous algae. In the past, when the water level in the playa lake was high, large numbers of fish (mostly Tilapia) escaped from Shishan marshes into the qa.
Before its degradation, Azraq Oasis was an outstanding example of an oasis wetland in an arid region, with few parallels anywhere else in the world. The oasis lies at the centre of the eastern part of the Africa-Eurasian flyway and was especially important for migratory birds. In fact, up to a million birds utilized the area during the course of a single spring migration, and as many as 50,000 birds were present in the wetlands at any one time. In February 1967 (mid-winter), approximately 347,000 waterfowl were recorded in an aerial survey, and this count included: 20,000 Anas Penelope; 180,000 A. crecca; 2,000 A. plalyrhynchos; 100,000 A. acuta; 5,000 Aythyafuligula; and 40,000 Fulica atra. The oasis is also important for breeding birds, and at least 33 species of waterbirds were known to be breeding in the wetlands in the 1960s, including 21 species occurring in internationally important numbers.
In addition to its many avifaunal residents, the oasis is also home to local subspecies of the Asian Jackal (Canis aureus syriacus), Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes Arabica) and Striped Hyaena (Hyaena hyaena syriaca), as well as the Tessellated Water Snake (Natrix tessellate) and two amphibians, Rana ridibunda and Bufo viridis. Moreover, the endemic Azraq Killifish (Aphanius sirhani), Jordan’s only endemic vertebrate species, is found nowhere else in the country. The primary object of the project is to halt further degradation of the aquatic ecosystems in the oasis and to restore as much of the wetlands as possible to a natural or near-natural condition with a view to maintaining the biological diversity of this unique wetland ecosystem. Another important aim of the project is to establish a sustainable basis for the utilization of the water resources of the Azraq Basin.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: The Azraq project has five main components: (1) rehabilitation and management of Azraq Wetland Reserve; (2) establishment of an environmental impact assessment unit within the Department of Environment and improved implementation of the Ramsar Convention in Jordan; (3) establishment of guidelines for agricultural development in the Azraq Basin; (4) investigation of groundwater resources in the Azraq Basin and development of a water management plan for the basin; and (5) support for long-term research on the conservation and management of water resources in arid and semi-arid regions.

At the outset of the project, five staff members were recruited to conduct daily patrols of the reserve in order to control illegal grazing and fires. An on-site rangers' station was constructed, and large amounts of rubbish were removed. Water was returned to the wetlands in June 1994, and is being provided through pumping of underlying aquifers at a government well field 12 km north of the site. Current flows amount to c. 1.5 MCM/yr, or approximately 10% of the original input (although the project has been given a provision of up to 2.5 MCM). 

At the same time water was being returned to the wetlands, an extensive rehabilitation and clean-up effort was begun to enhance the potential for recovery. Two relic spring pools were dredged and enlarged, and many of the wadis leading to the reserve were also cleaned and deepened to enable channeling of as much surface runoff as possible during the rainy season. A new perimeter fence was erected to exclude the site from exploitative activities, and feral grazing animals (water buffalo and horses) were removed.

A management plan for the site was finalised in 1996, and under this plan, procedures will be implemented to address the issues of grazing by domestic livestock, disposal of rubbish in the reserve, and hunting. This plan also includes strategies for making the fullest possible use of limited water supplies, and thus ensuring a viable nucleus of plant and animal communities from which rapid recolonization of wetland habitats can occur. 

Construction of a new visitors' center began in 1997, and the center opened to the public in autumn 1998. Other facilities of an educational, recreational and scientific nature for both national and international visitors will also be constructed. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Towards the end of October 1994, the water table in the lakes began rising, and parts of the oasis started to come back to life. Beginning in November, the rainy season of 1994-95 yielded above-average precipitation, and over ten million cubic meters of water reached the wetlands, almost twice the annual average of surface runoff. In that season, the area covered by water in the wetlands was about 16 km2, whereas it had been reduced to almost nothing prior to the project. 

Unfortunately, the next season (1995-1996) was a declared national drought, and the area received a total of less than 30 mm of rainfall for the season. Nevertheless, because of the rehabilitation efforts, a large portion of the wetlands remains in an environmentally and ecologically healthy state, with the water covering over 3.5 km2 in the marshes and lakes.

Wetland communities soon re-established following the reintroduction of water to the site. Terrestrial communities in the marsh region now have 133 species of vascular plants belonging to 100 genera and 33 families, including 7 species new to Jordan and unique to Azraq. The rehabilitated ecosystem has also brought 12 new aquatic plant species and 20 species of aquatic insects, 11 of which are considered new to Azraq. These new species include: Corix spp, Pachynomus lethierryi, and Chironomus calipterus. Moreover, a total of 209 avifaunal species have been recorded during monitoring activities at the site, including: Ciconia nigra, Circaetus gallicus, Circus aeroginosus, Chettusia leucura, Caprimulgus aegyptius, Rhamphocoris clotbey, Eremalauda dunni, Oenanthe moesta, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, and Acrocephalus melanopogon. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The rehabilitation efforts of the Azraq Project have increased the flow of the springs again. However, the increase has been very slight and amounts to less than 200,000 m3 per year, a fraction of pre-disturbance flows. If an appreciable recovery of the site is to be achieved, more water must be allocated to the wetlands. Under the current conditions of population growth and development, however, increasing demand for scarce water resources has made the provision of additional flows a contentious issue. The success of this project will ultimately hinge on the ability of local policy makers to resolve this conflict and effectively manage the region's limited water resources.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The near-total collapse of the wetlands ecosystem had immediate and direct effects on the livelihoods of the people of Azraq. The damages ranged from the collapse of the tourism industry to declining agricultural productivity and increased rural to urban migration. The agricultural losses were enormous. The increased salinity of soils and waters caused major financial losses for outside investors as well as for local farmers. Accurate figures for these losses are not available, but researchers in the Azraq Oasis Conservation Project estimate them to be in the hundreds of thousands of dinars. The rehabilitation of the oasis promises to reverse some of these negative socioeconomic trends and bolster the local economy with a source of revenue and livelihood. An especially important outcome of the project will be increased tourism, as visitors will stimulate investment in the local community from companies with an interest in eco-tourism.
Notable project achievements include the following:
1. An adequate amount of water was secured to revive and rehabilitate the Azraq wetland ecosystem and its biodiversity.
2. The water quality of the Azraq Basin was enhanced, as the advance of the saline front was slowed. Consequently, the danger of the complete salinization of the Azraq Basin has been lowered.
3. An incremental minimization of pumping was attained. The ideal solution of bringing pumping down to the system’s natural safe yields was not attained, but it is a move in the right direction. Indeed, the precedent of reverse pumping to save the Azraq water supply and ecosystem has been established.
4. Positive socioeconomic trends among the local community have been attributed to the rehabilitation of the oasis. Increasing numbers of tourists are visiting the area, and numerous companies have expressed interest in investing in eco-tourism.
5. The local people, after a lengthy period of frustration, were empowered and began to participate in the overall socioeconomic development of the area. With the support of the Azraq Oasis Conservation Project, a grassroots movement known as the Friends of Azraq Society was established to foster environmental preservation and the achievement of local socioeconomic stability.
Continuing challenges include:
1. population growth
2. lack of commitment to protection measures under RAMSAR
3. continuing economic development that demands more water
4. regional scarcity of water resources. Management of the rehabilitated wetland habitat will aim to restore open water and low marsh communities, both of which are virtually absent from the site currently, owing to the dominance of Phragmites. These communities were exceedingly important for sustaining the abundance and diversity of species within the reserve, particularly waterbirds such as waders and dabbling ducks. Another management priority will be evaluating potential sources of additional water for the reserve in order to ensure continued flows at the current level and possibly even increase the available flow. Options identified thus far include: abstraction from underground aquifers; harvesting from seasonal rivers (wadis) adjacent to the site; re-cycling locally used domestic water; and pumping from a nearby seasonal lake. The feasibility of each of these options must be determined so that steps can be taken to begin the process of securing the necessary approval and infrastructure. "

Degraded areas develop a hard crust on the soil’s surface that reduces infiltration capacity and leads to increased runoff of rainfall. The soil’s inability to absorb needed moisture precipitates nutrient imbalances that compromise productivity and ultimately decrease per capita food production. In order to address this growing concern and evaluate different strategies for rehabilitating crusted soils, an experiment was conducted using varying combinations of termites and mulch to stimulate natural regenerative processes. By delineating termite and nontermite experimental plots that either incorporated mulch or were left bare, researchers were able to identify specific factors responsible for favorable signs of regeneration. The study showed that plots with termite activity had greater vegetation cover than sites without; and sites incorporating both termites and mulch were the most productive of all. The lessons afforded by this research have important implications for land management and rehabilitation in the region and, ultimately, for the livelihoods of local communities.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry In the Sahelian zone of West Africa, the combined effect of soil organic matter depletion due to overgrazing, continuous cultivation, and the decrease in rainfall in the last 30 years has resulted in the increase of crusted and unproductive land. Such land is characterized by low infiltration capacity, nutrient imbalance, reduced biodiversity, and very low to zero primary production. Annual runoff resulting from these degraded soils is estimated at 60-80% of annual rainfall on Cambisols and 50-90% on Lixisols. The vegetation is of the steppe type according to UNESCO’s (1973) classification, consisting mostly of annual herbs and shrubs with few annual grasses and large bare areas. The life form for the grasses is dominantly annual therophytes; perennial grasses are rare (Mando 1991). The woody component is dominated by shrubs. The most important families are Mimosaceae and Combretaceae. The common termite genera are Microtermes, Macrotermes, and Odontotermes.
Lixisols and Cambisols are the most common soil types in the area (Burreau National des Sols 1995). The soil types on the experimental site are chromic cambisol, ferric lixisol, and haplic lixisol.
Chromic Cambisol has a pH between 5 and 8 from 5 cm to 120 cm depth, cation exchange capacity (CEC) < 17 cmol (+)/kg from 0 cm to 120 cm depth. The textural classes according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture system are sandy clay loam in the top 5 cm (49% sand, 29% silt, and 21% clay) and clay below 70 cm depth (45% clay, 20% sand, and 35% silt). Average bulk density is 1.6 g/cm3 at 0-5 cm depth and 1.7 g/cm3 at 120 cm depth. Soil organic matter content is 0.6% between 0 cm and 20 cm depth and 0.2% at 120 cm depth.
Ferric Lixisol has a pH of about 4.1 at 5 cm depth and 6.1 at 110 cm depth. CEC is 6 cmol(+)/kg at 5 cm depth and 12.4 cmol(+)/kg at 120 cm depth. The textural class is sandy loam (20% clay, 43% silt, and 37% sand). The average bulk density is 1.5 g/cm3 at 5 cm depth and 1.7 g/cm3 at depths below 70 cm. Soil organic matter content is 0.51% at 5 cm depth but decreases to 0.17% at 120 cm depth.
Haplic Lixisol has pH < 5, CEC < 9 cmol(+)/kg, and sandy loam textural class (53% sand, 25% silt, and 21% clay). Average bulk density is 1.4 g/cm3 at 5 cm depth and 1.6 g/cm3 at 120 cm depth. Soil organic matter content is 0.3% at 5 cm depth and 0.17% below 100 cm depth. Termites are a major component of the soil fauna in the tropics (Lee & Wood 1971), and their importance in modifying soil properties is generally recognized (Lobry de Bruyn & Conacher 1990; Lavelle et al. 1992). When established on degraded soil, termites can improve soil physical properties within a short time (Mando 1997). They also play a key role in the decomposition process (Whitford et al. 1991). Yet, despite the relative abundance of information on termite ecology, little is known of the effect of termite-mediated processes on ecosystem productivity. Thus, the aim of this project was to evaluate the extent to which termite-mediated processes in crusted soil can rehabilitate the vegetation.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: The experiment was laid out on a wasteland of completely unvegetated ground. The site was fenced to exclude large herbivores, and three blocks were delineated--one on each soil type--in a split-plot design. The main treatment was an insecticide, to obtain termite-infested plots (termite plots) and nontermite plots. We used Dieldrin at a rate of 500 g a.i./ha spread on nontermite plots just before the experiment began. Dieldrin is a persistent, nonphytotoxic and nonsystemic insecticide of high contact and stomach activity to most insects (Charles 1979). Dieldrin was used after Dursban EC (at the rate of 400 g a.i./ha) had failed to keep termites away from nontermite plots.

The main plots were 50 x 50 m and were 50 m apart. The subplots were two groups of four plots, each 15 x 8 m and 8 m apart. The two groups of subplots in each main plot were 15 m apart. Mulch treatments were applied randomly in these plots. These were straw of Pennisetum pedicellatum applied at 3 tons/ha, woody material of Pterocarpus lucens applied at 6 tons/ha, and composite (straw and woody material) treatments applied at 4 tons/ha. In addition there was a control, bare plot with no mulch. Different rates of mulch were used to achieve the same degree of cover of organic mulch on the subplots.

Data were collected from August 1993 until November 1995. Termite activity was estimated 6 months after the application of the mulch by counting systematically the number of termite-made voids on four places of 1 m2 selected randomly on each subplot. This gives a good indication of the importance of termite activity. Every year the presence and absence of termites are observed on the plots.

Vegetation (herb) parameters were recorded on the plots during three rainy seasons (1993, 1994, 1995). The point quadrat method (Daget & Poisonnet 1971) was used to assess the probability of species occurrence, total cover, and the dynamics of species composition. The dry biomass of plants was assessed at maximum standing crop (September) by the integral cut method, cutting all living plants found in a 1-m2 quadrat. Forty samples were taken from each main plot (five samples per plot), air dried, and weighed. Data of plant dry biomass were used to calculate rainfall use efficiency (RUE) and infiltrated water use efficiency (IUE) for each main plot and each subplot. Rainfall use efficiency is the quantity (expressed in kg) of above-ground phytomass produced per 1 mm of rainfall, and infiltrated water use efficiency is the quantity of above-ground phytomass produced per 1 mm of infiltrated water. Infiltration was estimated as the difference between rainfall and runoff, assuming that surface water storage is part of the infiltration. RUE and IUE serve in dry lands as excellent indicators of soil, and hence of ecosystem productivity (Aronson et al. 1993).

In 1995, the woody component of the vegetation was surveyed by systematically counting and identifying all woody species on the plots to establish their density. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The rehabilitation of crusted bare soil in the presence of termites + mulch occurred within a short time span. Significant improvement in infiltration was found within 6 months (Mando et al. 1996). Even though our experiment was set up late in 1993 with regard to the onset of the rainy season (June), the vegetation responded to the treatments within the first year, and the response was amplified in 1994 and 1995. 

In all 3 years the plots with termite activity had more vegetation cover than insecticide-treated plots, but the differences were statistically significant during 1994 and 1995 and not in 1993. Mulch affected the vegetation cover in all the years, but the three mulch types (woody, straw, and composite) were always a homogeneous group that differed from bare plots, except for the first year when woody plots did not differ from bare plots. During the 1994 and 1995 rainy seasons, the data revealed a significant interaction of mulch and termite on plant cover (P = 0.02 in 1995 and 0.05 in 1995). In 1994, termite + straw plots had more plant cover than other mulch + termite plots. At the same time, nontermite plots did not differ from each other and from bare plots. By 1995, nontermite plots and bare plots were still a relatively homogeneous group compared to the termite + mulch plots. Between 1993 and 1995, plant cover increased on all plots except on bare plots where no vegetation developed.

The mulch types did not differ much in their effect, but this homogeneous group differed from bare plots, which remained bare during the three years. Termite and mulch interaction did not have a statistically significant effect on biomass in 1994 (P = 0.13). Plant biomass decreased in the order termite + straw, termite + composite, termite + woody material, nontermite composite, nontermite + straw, nontermite + woody, and bare. In 1995, termite and mulch interaction was significant (P = 0.03). Termite mulched plots formed a homogeneous group that differed from the homogeneous nontermite mulched plots and the bare plots group. The order remained the same as in 1994 in nontermite plots, but in termite plots composite and woody plots performed better than straw. Mean values of biomass data showed that plant biomass had increased in 1995 over 1994 on termite + composite and termite + wood plots but had decreased on termite + straw and on all nontermite plots.

Rainfall use efficiency was significantly affected by termites in 1994 and 1995, with termite plots having the greatest rainfall use efficiency (p < 0.01). Mean values of RUE increased from 1994 to 1995.

Infiltrated water use efficiency was not affected by termites in 1994 but was affected in the subsequent year, with termite plots having the greatest values. In both cases the effect verged on significance at the 5% level. The mulch effect resulted in statistically significant differences between mulch and bare plots in 1994, but no such significance was observed in 1995. In both cases, composite, straw, and woody treatments formed a homogeneous group.

There were more plant species on termite plots than on nontermite plots in 1994. All the vascular plants were therophytes. Diversity indexes and plant occurrence probability indicated the extreme dominance of two species in all plots: Aristida adscensionis and Shoenefeldia gracillis. They accounted for over two-thirds of total plant cover in 1994.

Three years after the establishment of the experiment, the following woody species were found on termite plots: Piliostigma reticulatum, Pterocarpus lucens, Guierra senegalensis, Acacia senegalensis, Acacia seyal, Terminalia avicinoides, and Zizuphus mauritiana. They are all well adapted to the Sahelian Sudanian conditions (Grouzis 1991), but they succeeded in establishing only on termite plots, without any significant difference in density between the mulch treatments. No tree managed to survive on nontermite mulched plots or bare ground plots. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Vegetation, measured as biomass, coverage, and number of species, performed better in termite straw plots than in termite composite and termite woody material plots during the first 2 years of the experiment, but the vegetation biomass in the latter two treatments increased over the years and in 1995 surpassed the vegetation biomass on the termite straw. This is probably because straw decomposed at a faster rate than woody material, likely due to the higher lignin content of the latter (Berendse et al. 1987). The protective effect of mulch and its biological effect on soil characteristics decline as the mulch decomposes. Tian et al. (1993) have established that termites prefer mulch that decomposes slowly and thus can retain its protective effects longer.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Farmers in Burkina Faso and in other areas of West Africa are extensively making use of termite-mediated processes to enhance soil restoration and agricultural production in their farming systems (e.g., the zai/tassa system, where organic material is put into small holes in which termites enhance decomposition and increase water infiltration; see Roose et al., 1992 and Mando et al., 2000).
Soil crust (especially a structural crust) is a severe constraint to plant development. Valentin (1995) has indicated its effects on seed emergence and infiltration rate. The zero production on bare plots and the very low production in the nontermite mulched plots indicated that neither removing human or animal pressure from already crusted soil nor protecting it against the impact of rain drops or increasing sediment trapped by the many tiny physical barriers due to mulch can rehabilitate the productivity of structurally crusted soil in a short period. The diverse physical effects of mulch alone appear to be ineffective in structurally-crusted conditions, because nontermite mulched plots do not perform better than bare soil.
But placing mulch on crusted soil in the Sahel results in the colonization of this soil by termites. These termites open up numerous voids on the sealed surface of the soil. These voids have a great hydrological significance because they alleviate the infiltration constraint caused by soil crust. In fact, Chase and Boudouresque (1987) stated that a single termite channel of 0.8 cm diameter can sustain a water flow rate of 500-700 ml/minute for 30 minutes. The increase in water infiltration due to termite-made voids leads to an increase in soil water storage (Mando 1997). Furthermore, termite-made voids improve soil physical characteristics such as bulk density, resistance to penetration, and porosity (Mando 1997) and therefore create conditions necessary and sufficient for both woody vegetation and herbs to reestablish.
Termite effects on IUE verged on significance at the 5% level in 1994 and 1995 (p = 0.07 in 1994 and p = 0.04), while termite effects on RUE were highly significant in both years. This indicates that the gap between the performance of termite and nontermite plots is greatly reduced once the infiltration constraint has been removed, suggesting that their effect on soil infiltration is one of the most important mechanisms promoting the revegetation of crusted soil. The preponderant role of infiltration improvement in vegetation rehabilitation has previously been pointed out by Hien (1995), but the important fact here is that the improvement in infiltration brought about by termites is enough to trigger vegetation development resulting in high biomass and 80-200% plant cover within 3 years.
The present study has shown not only how locally available organic resources (i.e. straw, woody materials, manure, etc.) can be used to stimulate regenerative processes, but also how soil-structure degradation results from eradicating native soil fauna (termites in this case). By constructing and opening voids near the soil surface (top 10 cm), and thus facilitating the infiltration of water, termites are a critical component of the ecosystem. Efforts to avoid future land degradation and rehabilitate already-degraded lands should begin with the continual application of organic resources in order to support and maintain termite populations and thereby promote the regeneration of soil and the reestablishment of vegetation. It would be useful to investigate the effect of mulch quality and soil management on the termite population. The efficient mulch rate for revegetating crusted soil and sustaining termite populations, as well as the socioeconomic aspects of using termite-mediated processes in land management should also be explored further.

OBJETIVO DEL PROYECTO
El objetivo de este trabajo fue inducir la restauración de los matorrales semiáridos del Valle del Mezquital en Hidalgo, México a través del uso de plantas silvestres inoculadas con hongos micorrizógenos arbusculares (HMA) provenientes del suelo de la zona.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: DESCRIPCION DE ACTIVIDADES REALIZADAS

Los métodos empleados fueron: evaluar la cantidad de los HMA presentes en los suelos y su asociación con especies nativas utilizando la extracción en agua; masificación de los HMA usando plantas trampa de rápido crecimiento en sustrato estéril en condiciones de invernadero. Con el inóculo masificado se establicieron lotes de plántulas de especies nativas con los tratamientos micorrizadas y no micorrizadas, las plantas fueron: Prosopis laevigata (mezquite), Acacia farnesiana (huizache), Mimosa biuncifera (gatuño), Opuntia streptacantha (nopal) y Bouteloua curtipendula (pasto).

Las semillas utilizadas y el suelo fueron colectados en el Valle del Mezquital, es decir son materiales autóctonos a la zona que se restaura. Se llevaron a cabo pruebas de germinación a las semillas. El suelo de los sitios menos perturbados fue usado como inóculo de hongos micorrícicos después de un ciclo de masificado con la graminea anual (Lollium multiflorum).

Se preparó un sustrato estéril compuesto de suelo-arena silica para inocular y dejar crecer lotes de plántulas en el invernadero de la FES Zaragoza. Asimismo, se puso un lote testigo sin inóculo de cada especie. Se dió seguimiento al crecimiento de las plantas en condiciones de invernadero durante cuatro meses. Después fue sacrificado un lote para evaluar la biomasa y la colonización de la raíz. El resto de las unidades experimentales fueron aclimatadas para su posterior transplante a condiciones de campo. El transplante se realizó en la epoca de lluvias colocando al azar las especies en el terreno a restaurar.

Las siguientes plántulas fueron llevadas a campo (la mitad micorrizada y la otra no micorrizada): 84 de Prosopis laevigata; 24 de Acacia farnesiana; 44 de Mimosa biuncifera; 80 de Opuntia streptacantha; 80 de Bouteloua curtipendula; y 70 de Bouteloua gracilis. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: DESCRIPCION DE LA RECUPERACION QUE SE LOGRO

La propagación del inóculo se logró a partir de suelo de las zonas conservadas del Valle del Mezquital. Se establecieron macetas de propagación en condiciones de invernadero en la Cd. De México. La respuesta a la masificación fue positiva; las esporas se triplicaron, se colocaron inicialmente 350 esporas/100g de suelo seco y se obtuvieron 1055 esporas/100g de suelo.

Las plantas mostraron la influencia de la micorrización con HMA en la sobrevivencia y el crecimiento en el ambiente natural. Los porcentajes de sobrevivencia a los 12 meses del transplante eran: 83.33 micorrizadas, 11.66 no micorrizadas de P. laevigata; 43.00 micorrizadas, 36.00 no micorrizadas de A. farnesiana; 91.66 micorrizadas, 83.33 no micorrizadas de M. biuncifera; 91.60 micorrizadas, 83.30 no micorrizadas de O. streptacantha; 0.0 micorrizadas, 0.0 no micorrizadas de B. curtipendula; y 21.2 micorrizadas, 0.0 no micorrizadas de B. gracilis. Las plantas inoculadas que feron llevadas a campo sobrevivieron de una mejor manera que las plantas no inoculadas. Es notorio que la inoculación micorricica favoreció la supervivencia de las plantas, a pesar de que la mayoría fue depredada en su follaje por la fauna local (posiblemente cabras, borregos, conejos y grillos). 

Aparte de ser depredadas, las plantas sufrieron estres por el transplante y mostraron una disminucion tanto en tamano como en numero de hojas, quedando solamente los tallos en pie. Las plantas inoculadas se recuperaron en mayor proporcion que las no inoculadas, y las que se recuperaron crecieron aumentando el numero de ramificaciones a partir de un solo tallo y continuando con su crecimiento radical. Este proceso de crecimiento refleja el patron basico para las leguminosas; es decir, las raices crecen buscando la profundidad del suelo y la parte aerea, ramoneo, comienza a ramificarse a partir de la base del tallo y a llenarse de hojas. En todos los casos, las hojas eran más pequenas en comparacion con los tamanos alcanzados en condiciones de invernadero.

En el caso de Opuntia, la sobrevivencia es alta, pero el crecimiento muy lento, por lo que pasan desapercibidas a los herbivoros y no son depredadas significativamente. Sin embargo, son plantulas juveniles que aun no se puede asegurar que lleguen a ser adultos. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: LIMITES DE LA RECUPERACION

En Acacia y Mimosa se observó un patrón de decrecimiento en la altura que fue el siguiente: durante el primer mes las plantas decrecieron por depredación, quedando sin hojas. A los 6 meses se muestra un decremento muy drástico que se debió a las condiciones ambientales, ya que era época de secas y heladas y estas especies son caducifolias, por lo que fue difícil saber si la planta estaba viva o muerta.

En las gramineas el crecimiento en invernadero fue bueno pero en campo no sobrevivieron. Fueron depredadas en una semana y sólo algunas plantas (2) se mantuvieron vivas. La plantación fue reiterada en 2 años consecutivos, y en ambas la depredación fue muy intensa.

Después de un año de transplante se revisó la colonización radical de plantas sobrevivientes de cada tratamiento. Se encontró que las plantas inoculadas de Prosopis disminuyeron su grado de colonización en un 10%. Sin embargo, esta disminución no influyó sobre la sobreviviencia de las mismas. Las plantas no inoculadas, por el contrario, mantuvieron o aumentaron su porcentaje de colonización; sin embargo, el valor encontrado fue bajo (10% aprox.), y el número de esporas en la rizosfera en este caso también fue bajo, aproximadamente 800 esporas menos que las presentes en el tratamiento micorrizado (1506 vs. 2311). Es probable que se deba a esto el que las raices de las plantas no micorrizadas no hayan alcanzado mayor porcentaje de colonización. También es preciso señalar que probablemente el crecimiento aéreo de la planta no fue suficiente para sostener la asociación micorrícica que es demandante de azucares elaborados.
EVALUACION
Se concluye que la masificación de los HMA es posible usando macetas y plantas trampa, aunque hay que lograr mantener la diversidad y cantidad de esporas a lo largo del tiempo. Asimismo, el aumento en la sobrevivencia de las plantas micorrizadas en campo sugiere que la recuperación de la cubierta vegetal usando plantas silvestres y hongos autóctonos es un método viable, aunque la producción masiva de plantas micorrizadas puede ser una tarea laboriosa. Sin embargo, se compensa con el aumento en la probabilidad de sobrevivencia que como en el caso de Prosopis y Opuntia, que después de un año puede representar más del 80% de diferencia respecto a plantas no micorrizadas. Asimismo, queda probado que los HMA de los suelos de la zona tienen la capacidad de producir su propio inóculo. "

La dependencia en los recursos del río, y la explotación intensiva de los mismos, ha resultado en la degradación del ecosistema y la disminución de su capacidad productiva. Por consiguiente, se inició un programa de restauración implementado por investigadores del Departamento de Ecología y Recursos Naturales de la Universidad de Guadalajara. Enfocado en los aspectos sociales tanto como los ecológicos, el programa tiene tres componentes principales: la caracterización ecológica de la vegetación ribereña; una evaluación del uso y manejo campesino de la misma vegetación; y la restauración de areas degradadas con la participación de los pobladores.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Los recursos naturales de la cuenca baja del Río Ayuquila están en continuo proceso de transformación por actividades agropecuarias, industriales y urbanas. La descarga de aguas residuales de las ciudades de Autlan y El Grullo es una de las principales causas de degradación del río. Otro aspecto importante es el uso de agua para irrigación, por las implicaciones de su almacenamiento y desviación. El almacenamiento del agua en las presas Trigomil y Tacotan en la parte alta de la cuenca del río, ocasiona cambios en la dinámica ecológica y geomorfológica del río. La desviación del agua para fines de riego deseca una sección importante del río afectando la continuidad entre la parte alta y el valle, y reduciendo el caudal del río en la temporada de reigo (desde un 70 a 97%). Como resultado de estos procesos de degradación, los bosques ribereños y el hábitat acuático asociado a estas comunidades vegetales han sufrido intensas modificaciones (Santana et al. 1993, Martínez et al. 1999, Martínez et al. 2000). El objetivo del presente proyecto es evaluar el estado ecológico de los bosques ribereños y analizar las condiciones socio-ecológicas referente al uso y manejo de estos bosques, asi como implementar áreas demonstrativas de restauración de la vegetación ribereña, desde una perspectiva participativa. Este proyecto pretende generar información útil para el diseño de una propuesta de restauración participativa de la cobertura vegetal de los márgenes del río y contribuir al programa de gestión integral de la cuenca baja del Río Ayuquila.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Para evaluar el estado ecológico de la vegetación ribereña, se muestreo la vegetación a lo largo de aprox 90 km del Río Ayuquila entre las comunidades de La Laja (aguas arriba del área donde se derivan los canales del riego hacia el Valle de Autlan y El Grullo) y San Pedro Toxin (donde confluyen los Rios Armería y Tuxcacuesco). En esta sección del río también se ha implementado un programa de monitoreo de la calidad y flujo de agua desde 1996 (Martínez 1999).

Estos datos ecológicos se han usado para guiar unas actividades de restauración que se han realizado. Entre 2003 y 2004, se establecieron 40 parcelas de aproximadamente 50 m (longitud) x 10 m (500 m2 x 40) en los márgenes del río, con aprox. 4,500 plantas de especies nativas, tales como: sauce (Salix humboltiana) y sabino (Astianthus viminalis) colectadas y transplantadas de poblaciones naturales. Además, se plantó rosmorada (Tabebui rosae), primavera (T. donnell-smithii), guaje (Acacia macilenta), guamúchil (Pithecellobium dulce), parota (Enterolobium cyclocarpum), zalate y camichin (Ficus sp) propagadas en vivero. Además de los árboles usados para cercos vivos en parcelas agrícolas cercanas al río en los ejidos de El Aguacate, Emiliano Zapata y Ventanas. La selección de especies se basó en esta primera etapa en la lista propuesta en el Programa de restauración del Ingenio Melchor Ocampa (Martínez et al. 2002). La reforestación se realizó en la temporada de lluvias (durante julio y agosto) del 2003 y 2004, y contó con la participación de ciudadanos de las poblaciones vecinas (El Grullo, Autlan y El Chante), estudiantes del centro universitario regional, y personal del Ingenio, entre otros. En la mayoría de las parcelas se combinaron tres especies, siendo el sauce la especie común en todas ellas. Las plantas se distribuyeron en hileras intercaladas en forma de tresbolillo, usando espaciamientos desde 3 x 3 m y hasta 8 x 8 m. El método usado para la preparación del terreno fue la cepa común. Se hizo control manual de las malezas, tres veces al año. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Se tiene un programa de monitoreo de la sobrevivencia y crecimiento de las especies plantadas en 2003. La sobrevivencia entre especies fue variable, siendo la primavera, rosamorada y guaje las que presentaron mejores respuestas (60 a 64%). Los resultados completos de la plantación fueron: 286 plantadas y 154 sobrevivientes de caoba (53.85%); 207 plantadas y 133 sobrevivientes de rosamorada (64.25%); 148 plantadas y 89 sobrevivientes de primavera (60.14%); 102 plantadas y 46 sobrevivientes de cedro (45.10%); 90 plantadas y 58 sobrevivientes de guaje (64.44%); y 170 plantadas y 39 sobrevivientes de sauce (22.94%). El total para todas las especies fue 1003 plantadas y 519 sobrevivientes, o un 51.74 por ciento de sobrevivencia.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Estos bosques proveen importantes recursos naturales para los pobladores de la Sierra de Manantlán y su región de influencia--agua, madera, alimentos, forrajes, medicinas y otros diversos recursos no maderables, así como una variedad de servicios ambientales para los habitantes de la region y la sociedad en general--protección de cuencas, conservación de diversidad biológica y espacios para recreación, entre otros (SEMARNAP 2000, Vázquez 1995). Además, de su papel como proveedor de agua, el río Ayuquila es importante para la conservación de recursos acuáticos (peces, crustáceos, reptiles, mamíferos), algunas de las especies presentes son endémicas a esta región o se encuentran amenazadas (Santana et al. 1993).
El enfoque del programa de restauración, basado no solamente en la experimentación, sino también en el análisis ecológico y social de los márgenes del Río Ayuquila ha permitido ir desarrollando un enfoque integral de restauración. Además, ha permitido un entendimiento de las necesidades de diferentes actores sociales en la región, donde están no solamente los actores con un interés ecológico (por ejemplo, los habitantes de zonas urbanas, conservacionistas), sino también aquellos con un interés productivo (siendo los productores con tierras aledanas al río y pobladores de zonas rurales). Este análisis integral ha permitido un acercamiento con los diferentes actores y la obtención de información concreta, tanto desde de la perspectiva científica como desde de la perspectiva campesina (cf. Gerritsen 2002), sino también proponer alternativas viables con interés amplio.
Claro que quedan un número de desafios por resolver. Para empezar, si bien existe un acercamiento con los productores, falta reforzar los mecanismos que permitan la apropiación del proyecto por los productores. Parte de este problema se explica por las características de las actividades productivas en gran parte del área de estudio, las cuales muestran tendencias a la especialización y monocultivo (cf. Toledo 2000) dejando poco espacio para la diversificación del paisaje. Otro desafío tiene que ver con las respuestas de las especies seleccionadas en esta primera etapa del proyecto para las parcelas experimentales. Debido a la experimentación bajo condiciones campesinas, no se tiene una clara idea de las respuestas de las mismas, ya que estas parcelas están en proceso y ya insertada en una realidad social. Finalmente, si bien se busca la integración de diferentes actores sociales entorno al mismo tema, que es la restauración, las características típicas (idiosincrasia, intereses, nivel educativo) de cada uno de ellos a veces hace difícil la comunicación entre los mismos. Sin embargo, se concluye que el programa da mejores resultados con participación directa en la realidad social de la restauración ecológica, siendo esta el universo urbano-rural con todos sus actores involucrados en la región.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/canada-british-columbia-restoration-of-antelope-brush-aridlands-in-the-southern-okanagan-valley/	Canada: British Columbia: Restoration of Antelope-Brush Aridlands in the Southern Okanagan Valley	Canada	1998-09-13	2002-09-13	"In British Columbia’s Okanagan Valley lies a small pocket of desert constituting the northernmost extension of the Great Basin Desert and Canada’s only such ecosystem. A mix of shrub-steppe and bungrass grassland habitats, this arid region is increasingly threatened by development in the valley and the resultant fragmentation of critical habitats. In 1998, the Osoyoos Desert Society acquired a 50-hectare site and began implementing restoration experiments aimed at evaluating different techniques for seeding native grasses, as well as strategies for eliminating several prolific non-native species. By gaining a more thorough understanding of ecosystem processes and factors influencing vegetative composition, researchers hope to create a foundation for the restoration and conservation of larger areas of the Okanagan Valley.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Development for housing, roads, agriculture, and other uses has greatly reduced natural ecosystems in the South Okanagan, particularly in the valley bottoms (BC MoE 2001). Some ecological communities, such as the antelope-brush – needle-and-thread grass community, have been reduced to less than 40% of their historical extent, and are continually being threatened with even greater habitat loss (Dyer and Lea 2003). Riparian ecosystems have been very affected by development and by the channelization of the Okanagan River, and only 15% of these ecosystems remain (BC MoE 2001).
This human encroachment is such that habitat fragmentation has become a serious problem for wildlife. Wetlands and ponds are often separated from other habitat types by roads, fields, orchards, or developments, making it very difficult for species that require multiple habitat types (e.g. the spadefoot toad, which must migrate from pond to grassland and back throughout its life) (BC MoE 2001). Natural areas containing similar ecosystems are also segregated, making it difficult or impossible for populations to inter-breed or to colonize new habitat. Species richness and genetic diversity within species decrease with a reduction in habitat patch size (Duerksen et. al. 1997); and this reduction in patch size, caused by fragmentation, is what has contributed to the long list of threatened or endangered species in the South Okanagan. Species that have suffered as a result of this fragmentation include: coyotes (Canis latrans), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), American badger (Taxidea taxus), black bears (Ursus americanus), Great Basin gopher snake (Pituophis catenifer deserticola), Nuttall’s cottontail (Sylvilagus nuttallii), and many bird species [e.g. western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), mountain bluebird (Sialia currucoides), and lark sparrow (Chondestes grammacus)].
Cattle grazing is another problem in the South Okanagan, as grazing decreases the density of native bunchgrasses (Daubenmire 1970), destroys the cryptobiotic crust (an integral component of healthy soil) (Cannings and Durance 1998), and has driven the spread of non-native species such as cheatgrass (Daubenmire 1970). In fact, cheatgrass and Japanese brome (Bromus japonicus), two invasives, represent the largest threat to the health of the Osoyoos Desert Centre site’s natural communities. These species are capable of forming their own climax communities, to the exclusion of more desirable native species (Daubenmire 1970). In the case of cheatgrass, there is no evidence that it ever relinquishes an area to indigenes once it has become established (Daubenmire 1970). About 20% of the Osoyoos Desert Centre Site contains antelope-brush habitat (Atwood 1996). This habitat is generally found on sandy-loam or loamy sand-textured soils in the project site, though antelope-brush shrub-steppe on the west edge of the site contains more silt and clay (Atwood 1996). The antelope-brush shrub-steppe section of the Osoyoos Desert Centre site has an average shrub cover of 39% (dominant shrubs are antelope brush and great basin sage); a perennial native grass cover of 20% (dominant grasses are sand dropseed [Sporobolus cryptandrus] and needle-and-thread grass [Stipa comata]); a native forb cover of 11% (dominant forbs are snow buckwheat [eriogonum niveum], arrow-leaf balsam root [Balsamorhiza sagittata], brittle prickly-pear cactus [Opuntia fragilis], Indian wheat [Plantago patagonica], and yarrow [Achillea millefolium]); a micriobiotic crust cover of 25% (dominant species is rusty steppe moss [Torula ruralis]); and a non-native species cover of 57% (dominant species are cheatgrass [Bromus tectorum], diffuse knapweed, spotted knapweed [Centaurea maculosa], sweet white clover [Melilotus alba] and Japanese brome [Bromus japonicus]) (Atwood 1996).
The northern section of the Osoyoos Desert Centre site contains most of the Great Basin sage shrub-steppe, which makes up about 20% of the total site. Soil texture for this habitat type ranges from clay to silty loam (Atwood 1996). The Great Basin sage shrub-steppe component has a shrub cover of 31% (dominant shrubs are the Great Basin sage, common rabbitbrush [Chrysothamnus nauseosus] and green rabbitbrush [Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus]); a perennial native grass cover of 33% (dominant grasses are needle-and-thread grass, and sand dropseed); a native forb cover of 12% (dominant forbs are Indian wheat, pale comandra [Comandra umbellatum], long-leaved phlox [Phlox lonifolia], and yarrow); a microbiotic crust cover of 11% (dominant species are rusty steppe moss, fire moss [Ceratodon purpureus], and lichen species [Cladonia spp.]); and a non-native species cover of 42% (dominant species are cheatgrass, Japanese brome, and sweet white clover) (Atwood 1996).
Grassland habitat is located on flat areas of the Osoyoos Desert Centre site, and covers about 51% of the site (Atwood 1996). The soil texture is generally loamy sand, and a there is a large percentage (16%) of bare ground associated with the grassland sites (Atwood 1996). The bunchgrass grassland found at the site has an average shrub cover of 7% (dominant shrubs are antelope brush, common rabbitbrush, Great Basin sage, and silver sage [Artemisia cana]); a perennial native grass cover of 18% (dominant grasses are sand dropseed, and needle-and-thread grass); a native forb cover of 19% (dominant forbs are brittle prickly-pear cactus, Indian wheat, snow buckwheat, and golden aster [Heterotheca villosa]); a microbiotic crust cover of 16% (dominant species are rusty steppe moss, fire moss, and foliose and fruticose lichens [Peltigera didactyla and P. rufescens, and Cladonia spp., respectively]); and a non-native species cover of 51% (dominant species are diffuse knapweed, cheatgrass, crested wheatgrass, sweet white clover, spotted knapweed, Japanese brome, Kentucky bluegrass [Poa pratensis], quackgrass [Agropyron repens], toadflax [Linaria genistifolia], hound’s tongue [Cynoglossum officinale], and asparagus [Asparagus officinalis]) (Atwood 1996).
Riparian areas can be found in depressions and run-off areas, and their soil texture ranges from clay to silty clay loam. The riparian areas contain a few sporadic shrubs (dominant shrubs are Saskatoon [Amelanchier alnifolia], mock orange [Philadelphus lewisii], poison ivy [Rhus radicans], Great Basin sage, and antelope brush); a perennial native grass cover of 15% (dominant grasses are sand dropseed and needle-and-thread grass); a native forb cover of 2% (dominant forbs are lemonweed [Lithospermum ruderale], showy milkweed [Asclepias speciosa], shaggy daisy [Erigeron pumilus], parsnip-flowered buckwheat [Eriogonum heracloises] and yarrow); a microbiotic crust cover of 8% (dominant species are rusty steppe moss, golden curls moss [Homalothecium aeneum], and shaggy yellow sand moss [Racomitrium ericoides]); and a non-native species cover of 40% (dominant species are Japanese brome, cheatgrass, diffuse knapweed, and sweet white clover) (Atwood 1996).
A small portion of the Osoyoos Desert Centre site is comprised of rock outcrop habitat, which contains very shallow soils of a silty clay loam texture. The rock outcrop sites contain a shrub cover of 12% (dominant shrubs are Great Basin sage, Saskatoon, and prickly phlox, and antelope brush); a perennial native grass cover of 35% (dominant species are bluebunch wheatgrass and sandberg bluegrass [Poa secunda]); a native forb cover of 79% (dominant forbs are compact selaginella [Selaginella densa], low pussytoes [Antennaria dimorpha], thread-leaved daisy [Erigeron filifolius], snow and parsnipflowered buckwheat, round-leaved alumroot [Heuchera cylindrica], and bitterroot [Lewisia redeviva]); a microbiotic crust cover of 2% (dominant species are rusty steppe moss, a foliose lichen [Peltigera rufescens], and a fruticose lichen [Cladonia spp.]); and a non-native species cover of 9% (dominated by cheatgrass, Japanese brome, and diffuse knapweed) (Atwood 1996). – Restore the community structure, species composition, and function of the natural habitats
– Reduce the weedy species component
– Increase the cover and recruitment rate of native grasses and forbs
– Replace areas of early successional species with climax species
– Maximize species diversity within each habitat type
– Build local stewardship for the landscape as a means of promoting habitat conservation

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Eight restoration experiments were conducted on the Osoyoos Desert Centre site between 1998 and 2002. Approximately 40% of the native seed required for these experiments was collected during the 1998 field season. As seed matured, seed heads and plant stalks were cut from four native bunchgrasses: Aristida longiseta (red three-awn), Hesperostipa comata (needle and thread grass), Sporobolus cryptandrus (sand dropseed), and Pseudoroegneria spicata (bluebunch wheatgrass). The plant material was collected from natural shrub-steppe communities within the South Okanagan Basin Ecosection. Because extensive stands of native bunchgrasses are exceedingly rare in the South Okanagan, and access to them is difficult, the seed-collection process required a great deal of time and resources. Most of the remaining natural areas are on private land or are protected, and many landowners and land managers are reluctant to allow native seed harvesting. In addition to a poor supply, few seed collectors are trained, and seed cleaning techniques are rudimentary. The time required to gather and clean native seed varied by species, but producing 1 kg of pure seed (pick and clean) ranged from 6 person-hours for sand dropseed (Sporobulus cryptobulus) to 57 person-hours for bluebunch wheatgrass.

Three hundred and five 100-m2 experimental plots were then delineated, staked, and tagged (60 plots each at 5 experiment replicates at the same study site, plus 5 plots selected solely to assess the effect of control of dalmation toadflax). Baseline vegetation data was collected from 3 1-m2 quadrats randomly located within each 100-m2 plot (n = 915). Percent cover, distribution and vigour of the vascular plant species, along with percent cover of moss, lichen, litter, and bare ground, were collected from each quadrat. Soil texture data were also collected from the 100-m2 plots.

3,075 kg of noxious weeds were hand-pulled, bagged, and removed from areas around the experimental plots. The targeted species were diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa), dalmatian toadflax (Linaria genistifolia ssp. dalmatica), hound's tongue (Cynoglossum officinale), and mullein (Verbascum thapsus). Following weed removal, bare soils were covered with native hayseed. This hayseeding experiment, intended to assess variables influencing species recruitment, was initiated on two plots per replication (10 plots total) in September 1998. Approximately 200 litres of plant material (50 litres from each species) was distributed evenly over each 100-m2 plot.

In another experiment conducted in October 2000, broadcast seeding was initiated to evaluate the effect on native species establishment of different soil-disturbance conditions and different seed rates. 100-m2 plots were double split, producing four 25-m2 subplots. One-half of the plots were tilled to mimic soil disturbance that would be associated with development projects. Shrubs remained, but existing herbaceous vegetation was cut and removed from the plot before tilling and the soil was packed after tilling. Standing herbaceous vegetation was also cut and removed from the no-till plots. Non-native species remaining in the plots were spot treated with the herbicide glyphosate (Roundup), applied at the full label rate. The seed mix consisted of four perennial native bunchgrasses (A. longiseta, H. comata, S. cryptandrus, and P. spicata) and one annual agronomic Lolium multiflorum (annual ryegrass). The native grasses were combined evenly in the mix (25% live seed per species), and seed rates were 28 kg / ha (1027 seeds / m2) and 41 kg/ha (1504 seeds / m2). Application rates were adjusted to account for the germination rate of the collected seed. Each seed rate was broadcast on one-half of the 100-m2 plot and the soil was rolled after seeding.

Also in the fall of 2000, an experiment was conducted to determine how the addition of native vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) fungi might affect natural grass species establishment. One 100-m2 plot was divided into four 25-m2 subplots, and two treatments (Nurse plant inoculant and Soil-Root inoculant) and two control plots (no inoculant) were randomly established in each plot. Native VAM was produced on site for the inoculant treatments. Mature bunchgrasses on the site where tested and found to be colonized with vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae hyphae, ranging from an average percent colonization of 36.19% + 2.28% for A. longiseta, 38.91% + 1.69% for S. cryptandrus, 53.98% + 1.13% for H. comata, and 55.4% + 4.08% for P. spicata. Thus, bunchgrasses from the site were used as nurse plants (Nurse plant treatment) and also used to produce VAM beds that were harvested for the Soil-Root treatment. The harvested material was added to trenches in the experimental plots, spaced 15-cm apart. The plots were tilled, inoculated (or not), and then seeded with the native grass seed mix at 28 kg/ha. Percent cover data for the seeded native grasses were collected in June 2001 and 2002.

Besides experiments aimed at optimizing seeding techniques, project activities also encompassed experiments designed to evaluate different strategies for the elimination of invasive species. The first, begun in 1998, assessed the efficacy of solarization as a passive weed-removal technique. Ten 100-m2 plots were covered with transparent polyethylene sheets in 1998 and the plastic was removed from 5 of the plots in April 2000. Vegetation data were collected from the plots before the plastic was put down and again following its removal (June 2000 and 2002).

Besides solarization, manual and chemical weed removal was tested. One 100-m2 plot per replication was randomly chosen for the manual weed control, and two plots were treated chemically. The manual control of C. diffusa experiment was to determine the most effective time to hand weed C. diffusa, and whether weed density was related to the timing of the manual control. The first hand-pulling was scheduled for early May, after which monthly treatments were scheduled if weed density was > 25% of the original C. diffusa cover. The experiment for the chemical control of C. diffusa was implemented in 2000. C. diffusa plants in two 100-m2 plots per replication (10 plots) were spot sprayed with an over-the-counter broadleaf herbicide, Killex, at the recommended label rate of 1.85 kg active ingredient per hectare in May 2000. Killex, an over-the-counter combination of 2,4-D, mecoprop, and dicamba was used in the chemical control experiment to determine if adequate control of C. diffusa could be obtained using a less expensive broad-leaf herbicide with less residual than the commonly used Tordon 22K (picloram).

Finally, in 1998, grazing exclusion was tested as a means of eliminating invasives. Two randomly-chosen, 100-m2 plots in each replication were established as control plots (10 plots). Species identity and percent cover data were collected annually, in June, from 1998 to 2002. The control plots were monitored to document changes in the plant community without livestock grazing or restoration activity. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: On the Osoyoos Desert Centre research site, locally collected natural grasses established as a result of both hayseeding and broadcast seeding, although after the first growing season, soil condition (disturbed versus undisturbed) and soil type [high sand content (Rep 5) versus higher silt content (Rep 1 to 4)], coupled with ecological preferences of the grass species, had more of an effect on overall cover of seeded natural grasses than the seed rate. Broadcast seeding was more effective than hayseeding on undisturbed soils, and seed rate did not affect establishment. Rates of greater than 1000 s/m2 are thought to be high (Jacobs et al. 1999), and it appears applications that exceed that amount are unnecessary. The average cover of 28% that was reported on site would indicate that roughly 290 of the 1027 seeds planted germinated. Further work is required to determine if the level of plant establishment is a reflection of the carrying capacity of the local soils, given their low moisture and nutrient availability (Wicklow- Howard 1994), or the result of self-induced seed dormancy, which has limited germination in the harsh environmental conditions (Halvorson 1989, Allan et al 1994, O'Keefe 1996). 

The hayseed appeared to repress one of the most common grass species on the site, S. cryptandrus. The average cover of S. cryptandrus fell slightly in Rep 1 to 4 over the four years as compared to an 18% increase in cover in the control plots. S. cryptandrus cover increased in Rep 5, although the control plots increased at a higher rate (90% vs. 84%). When the hayseeding experiment was initiated, Rep 5 contained twice the amount of bare ground as Reps 1 to 4. Light availability was likely higher in Rep 5, even with the hayseed cover. Sabo et al (1979) reported germination of S. cryptandrus increased with light availability. In contrast, the hayseed cover enhanced P. spicata and H. comata establishment. H. comata only established in the sandy soils of Rep 5 when covered with hayseed mulch, and P. spicata, which was not found in the research plots before seeding, only established in areas that received the hayseed mulch or VAM inoculant. All of the seeded grasses are mycorrhizal (Trappe 1981) and VAM is particularly critical for the establishment of warm season grasses (Clapperton and Ryan 2001), which would include A. longiseta and S. cryptandrus. To date, VAM colonization levels that will improve grass establishment are unknown.

Solarization was not an effective weed control method for the primary weeds on the Osoyoos Desert site. C. diffusa and V. thapsus germinated readily following the removal of the plastic, indicating the 75ÂºC recorded under the plastic during treatment was not sufficient to kill the seeds. In addition, solarization resembles broadcast herbicide treatment, exposing large expanses of bare soil after treatment. Revegetating solarized areas with only locally collected native species will also require a consistent and long-term weed control program. Manual and chemical control of C. diffusa did reduce the weed component; however, livestock removal was the most effective weed control measure. In one year, weed cover in plots monitored for the effect of livestock removal dropped an average of 74% (71% in Rep 1-4 and 77% in Rep 5), and over five years there was a significant increase in native grass and herb cover. The rapid decline of C. diffusa is puzzling, however, since the species is known to have an extensive and long-lived seed bank. Reduced soil disturbance is a factor because C. diffusa did germinate in the tilled plots. However, Clements et al (unpublished) also found few viable knapweed seeds on the site, which may be the successful result of Sphenoptera jugoslavica (biological control agent  -  beetle), which occurs throughout the area. By 2002, A. cristatum was the dominant non-native species on the site. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Species establishment was influenced by soil type. Soil texture differed over the site, with textures in replications (Reps) 1 - 4 being similar, but Rep 5 soils containing more sand and less silt. On average, Rep 5 also contained a higher cover of litter, bare ground, weeds, and native herbs, but fewer native grasses than Reps 1 - 4. A. longiseta had higher establishment in sandier soils (Rep 5), while H. comata did best in siltier soils (Rep 1 to 4). The percent cover of H. comata was almost 7 times higher in Reps 1 to 4 than in Rep 5. A. longiseta and H. comata are both promoted as drought tolerant species and yet, the limited establishment of A. longiseta, and preferential establishment of H. comata, suggests they were affected by the droughty conditions experienced in the South Okanagan over the past four years. Indeed, Weaver (1968) did find that A. longiseta decreased in extended droughts. It is also possible that the high heat requirement for A. longiseta germination was not met prior to the June data collection (Evans and Tisdale 1972).
The experiments conducted thus far on the Osoyoos Desert site have demonstrated that seeding technique and seed mix composition must be considered and matched to local environmental conditions. That being said, some techniques can aid in the establishment of species in environments they would not normally colonize. This phase of the Osoyoos Desert Centre restoration plan focused on reducing the weedy species component and increasing the cover and recruitment rate of native grasses and forbs. Future efforts could be directed at replacing areas of early successional species with climax species and maximizing species diversity within each of the identified habitat types. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/kenya-rehabilitation-of-semi-arid-lands-in-the-ukambani-region/	Kenya: Rehabilitation of Semi-Arid Lands in the Ukambani Region	Kenya	1985-09-11	1985-09-11	"Agroforestry for Integrated Development in Semi-arid Areas of Kenya (ARIDSAK) is a project charged with the development, implementation and promotion of appropriate agricultural and agroforestry technologies and policies to improve the livelihoods of poor farmers and pastoralists in the semi-arid areas of the Ukambani Region. Apart from conservation and management of the environment, the project promises to play a critical role in the creation of employment opportunities, poverty alleviation, domestic wood production, food security and income generation. A major component to date has been the establishment and maintenance of small-scale tree nurseries to provide seedlings for the revegetation of surrounding areas. Many local farmers and community groups are actively involved in managing these nurseries, and their participation has afforded them a number of valuable skills. In addition to the nursery component, the project has placed much emphasis on developing effective strategies for widely disseminating new, field-tested technologies. In order to reach local communities, project staff works closely with a core group of farmers, and then entrusts these trainees to transmit the techniques to more peripheral beneficiaries. Individuals and community groups from other areas in eastern Africa, as well as areas in southern Africa, have also been trained in valuable agroforestry practices via extension materials created by project staff as a result of their work in the Ukambani Region. Thus, the project has met with success in the institutionalization of promising social forestry practices, and has been able to develop a forum for sharing outcomes with other communities throughout Africa.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Land degradation by cropping and overgrazing has been a recurring theme throughout the last 70 years of colonial, and later national, agricultural and resource-management programmes. In this region, the high susceptibility of cropland to erosion derives from a combination of factors: concentrated settlement in fertile and well-watered hilly terrain; the tendency of the soils to “cap”; and the fact that 70 per cent of the most erosive rainstorms occur in the first month of the rainy season, before crops can establish an effective cover (Barber, Thomas, and Moore 1981; Moore 1979). Cattle, goats, and sheep also have pronounced effects on those Ukambani soils that have a propensity to form a pavement-like surface when denuded by overgrazing and physically compacted by trampling. The resulting land degradation, in turn, reduces future crop and livestock production. The most widespread vegetation type in Ukambani, and especially in Kitui, is semi-arid deciduous woodland and bushland. Acacia/Commiphora associations are found in the 800-1,200 m elevation range; and in the dry areas below 900 m, Commiphora/Sanseveria thorn bush transitions into semi-desert vegetation (Ojany and Ogendo 1973; Owako 1971; Porter in prep.). The project’s overarching goal is the rehabilitation of forest resources. However, before a comprehensive rehabilitation action plan could be formulated, the available technical tools and capacity for rehabilitation had to be expanded. Consequently, project partners created an initial programme to perfect the tools of rehabilitation intervention with the following objectives in mind:
– To improve capacity of extension service and farmers in dryland forest rehabilitation;
– To establish methods of seedling management and tree establishment;
– To establish restoration possibilities for degraded woodlands, soils and soil moisture regimes;
– To select, develop and promote high value timber and food trees to fit into alternative livelihood commodity development options; and
– To develop a social forestry extension model for arid and semi-arid areas.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
This project adopts an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach involving all the stakeholders in the planning and implementation process. Specialists employed by the implementing agencies work closely with selected core farmers, local groups and organisations representing beneficiaries in order to disseminate information and practical techniques. Through on-site research and development, technologies are innovated and tested under field conditions, and then extension materials are created for use in training local farmers. This core group of trainees is responsible for providing information to neighbouring farmers, and in this way, the involvement of peripheral parties is ensured.

Description of Project Activities: Fifty-four small-scale nurseries (22 of which were commercial) were established in three districts of Ukambani and Maasai (Kitui, Makueni and Kajiado). Women's groups managed 70% of these nurseries, while groups comprising both women and men managed the remaining 30%. The focus of these nurseries was propagation and nursery management of seedlings, tree planting in farms, and income generating opportunities. One notable accomplishment of the project's nurseries is a breakthrough on the germination, propagation, and rearing of a problematic tree species, Melia volkensii, which grows fast and produces durable timber of high value under local farming conditions.

Nursery activities were promoted for ten years, from 1985 to1995, and five years after the end of this formal intervention period (2000), an evaluation was carried out to assess the role of the nurseries within the local context. The evaluation revealed that, although 25% of the original contact groups had stopped nursery activities, some 18% of the groups involved in nursery activities were new, and there were more individuals (some of whom were part of the fallout groups) that had taken up small-scale nursery activities. Of further interest was the fact that the estimated total annual seedling production by small-scale nurseries had changed from 550,000 (1993) to a total of 1,245,000 (2000). Moreover, among the seven activities of the women's and mixed men's/women's groups, nursery activities had acquired greater importance, moving from sixth position to third or fourth position.

More than 500 ha of experimental and demonstration plots were established under the project. Several methods were proposed for use by farmers in enhancing establishment of tree seedlings under dryland conditions. One such method was to exclude plots from animal grazing in order to allow for a more expeditious revegetation. In these protected areas, the succession of vegetation recovery began with the quick re-establishment of a dense, shrubby layer comprised of the following dominant species: Hermannia oliveri, Aspilia mossambicensis, Solanum incanum, Chloris roxburghiana and Sporobolus fimbriatus. This layer then creates favorable conditions for the establishment of drought-tolerant woodland species dominated by: Commiphora africana, Acaica senegal, A. tortilis, A. mellifera, A. brevispica and Terminalia brownii. Within two to four years, some of the species had grown to heights beyond the browsing levels of goats. Because grazing exclusion proved to be such a successful approach to revegetation, it has been promoted in the Ukambani districts and is now being used by the animal range management farmers in the restoration of degraded woodlands to provide more foliage and tree resources for ecosystem users.

In addition to selecting trees specifically for rehabilitation of degraded lands, a deliberate effort was made to select tree species of high economic value in order to provide an incentive for tree planting. Such trees included: Melia volkensii (indigenous, fast-growing, and resistant to termites); Dalbergia melanoxylon (indigenous and slow-growing, but highly valued for wood carving); Terminalia brownii (indigenous and favored for its good form and resistance to termites); Senna siamea (exotic and prioritized for its fast growth and, therefore, quick provision of fuelwood); Mangifera indica (a fruit tree that has become successful); and Citrus sinensis (for its adaptability and fruits).

The main constraint to dryland forestry practice is inadequate moisture to ensure establishment of seedlings. Four water conservation/harvesting methods were widely tested, and an evaluation of these efforts indicated that the use of soil structures to concentrate water to the seedlings has been adopted by over 40% of tree-growing farmers. Unfortunately, the use of terracotta water-retention material, which had been promoted, proved too expensive for the small-scale farmers. Where water is available, recommended watering regimes and watering schedules are used by almost 100% of the tree growing farmers.

As part of the project's technology development component, some extension approaches were tested for their effectiveness in disseminating new technologies to local farmers. One approach used to demonstrate emergent technologies was organizing mobile shows. Over the course of 30 such shows at different venues, some 7,345 participants were reached in about one third of the Ukambani district. Another effective approach was to train a core group of farmers in different techniques and then entrust them with the task of sharing their knowledge with neighboring farmers through friendly, productive visits. A random survey carried out by the project found that more than 50% of the people who received technical information on tree planting made use of such knowledge. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Commercial tree nurseries have taken root with farmers producing over 1.5 million seedlings annually. Fast-growing local and exotic species have been introduced, and farmers have planted many of these in their farms. Over 500 ha of demonstration and experimental trials have been established in public land within farming areas and are accessible to farmers and schools for training. Several extension methods and approaches have been tested, and a social forestry extension model has been developed through the project experience. A dryland tree technology development and demonstration Centre, covering over 1 000 ha was established and gazetted and continues to provide excellent transfer of dryland tree planting and conservation technologies.

Although it has not been possible to achieve a total areal cover of species planted under the auspices of the project, it estimated that during the last 5 or so years, M. volkensii has gained a collective cover of about 50 ha, D. melanoxylon a cover of 5 ha, 5 ha of S. siamea, 3 ha of T. brownii and over 60 ha of M. indica.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Over 2,000 farmers, teachers, women's groups, and frontline extensionists were trained in dryland tree planting, conservation and management through a programme of 80 courses developed under this project. In addition to national courses, regional courses on social forestry were conducted covering dryland tree technologies, extension methodologies, policy formulation to promote social forestry in drylands, and the role of forestry in aiding conservation and mitigating desertification in other areas of eastern and southern Africa. Regular participants in these annual Regional Social Forestry for Drylands training courses include: Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. To date, approximately 160 individuals from eastern and southern Africa have been trained in social forestry.
The capacity of farmers to rehabilitate degraded drylands has been improved not only in the area of the project but throughout eastern and southern African. Several intervention technologies have been developed, and their use has made verifiable strides toward reversing degradation and encouraging more sustainable use of ecosystem resources. As a result of an experience on social forestry and tree planting technologies development in dry areas of Kitui, Makueni and Kajiado Districts of Kenya since 1985, a Social Forestry Extension Model has been developed by the Kenya-Japan supported dryland initiative. The model comprises of the foundation of continuous development of technologies to support changing management needs with time, a framework of assimilation of new technologies by farmers through on-farm adaptive trial-cum-production trials and a thatching of extension approaches, a number of which have been mentioned in the sections above. It is expected that extension service and farmers would benefit from the model. The project proposes to develop soon appropriate guidelines for handling and putting in practice the various aspects of the extension model. A Belgium supported drylands forestry intervention has taken to the use of the project experience to develop district management plans for sustainable use by the extension service and farmers in the Ukambani and Maasai districts.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/united-kingdom-scotland-the-river-ythan-restoration-project/	United Kingdom: Scotland: The River Ythan Restoration Project	United Kingdom	2001-08-01	2005-02-28	"Increasing eutrophication in the Ythan Estuary of northeast Scotland led to a river restoration project in 2001 in which planners worked closely with farmers in the catchment area to develop innovative ways of mitigating agricultural pollution. Demonstration farms were established to raise awareness about “cleaner” alternatives to existing practices, and a new software program was created to assist participating farmers with the completion of nutrient budgets for their farms. Furthermore, farmers were encouraged to create buffer strips between cultivated fields and stretches of watercourse in order to reduce both sediment and pollution in the river system. In addition to these outreach and education activities, the project also incorporated a streamside restoration component in which a number of sites along the river were treated to improve riparian habitat conditions. Restoration activities included the felling of non-native spruce, construction of fish ladders, erosion control through revegetation, and redesign of existing weirs. Although monitoring surveys have not yet shown an improvement in water quality, the Ythan Project has successfully involved the local community in important environmental issues and encouraged farmers to adopt practices that will ultimately facilitate the long-term rehabilitation of the watershed.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Water quality in the River Ythan catchment has steadily worsened over the past couple of decades. Increasing levels of nitrates and phosphates from agricultural run-off, along with discharges from sewage treatment facilities, have led to considerable nutrient enrichment in the river and, more prominently, in the estuary. Eutrophication of estuary waters has become a major concern because algal blooms have been shown to reduce the quantity and availability of the small, mud-dwelling invertebrates upon which the estuary’s bird populations are dependent. This degradation of critical habitat has compromised the estuary’s status as a Special Protection Area for wading birds under the European Birds Directive. The Ythan Estuary is a designated Special Protection Area (SPA) for its wading bird populations, and it supports the largest breeding colony of eiders (Somateria) on the UK mainland. The estuary is also part of the Forvie National Nature Reserve and has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. – To introduce measures aimed at reducing pollutants, and thus mitigate the growth of algae in the estuary and enhance the river’s ecological value
– To provide a model of best practice for the involvement of local communities in sustainable land management

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The project’s stakeholders include: local residents; local government; landowners; land managers and farmers; and national government agencies responsible for conserving the river.

Description of Project Activities: Fortyâˆ’seven public events were organised in association with the project, from workshops and information sessions to volunteer tree planting days. Aimed at raising community awareness of important environmental issues related to water management and encouraging community involvement in the project, these events attracted a wide range of people and resulted in the formation of a core group of volunteers that participated throughout the project.

Initial river surveys were conducted between 2002 and 2004 with the help of a few volunteers. These surveys, intended to provide baseline data for use in later monitoring, focused on the main stem of the Ythan and two significant tributaries. A 500-metre stretch of water was surveyed every 2 kilometres for the entire length of the river, and in 2004, data on the use of land immediately adjacent to the watercourse was also collected. 

Consultation and collaboration with farmers was an integral part of the project, as the implementation of more environmentally-friendly farming practices was a primary objective. Two demonstration farms were established to illustrate the benefits of new agriâˆ’environment schemes and nutrient budgeting. The farms were publicised through the local press and the project's website, and direct invitations were distributed to farmers who had previously expressed interest. Seven tours were arranged for local farmers in order to demonstrate the potential of new agri-environment schemes and allow farmers the opportunity to discuss ideas directly with one another. 

One innovative new idea tested at the demonstration farms was pasture pumps for off-stream watering. At Ordhill Farm, one of the two demo farms, pasture pumps were installed in one of the fields during the summer of 2003. These pumps are activated by the pressure of the cow's nose and draw water up from the burn and into the small drinking trough. This eliminates the need for cattle to enter the burn to drink, thereby reducing erosion and other impacts. The pumps worked well and garnered much interest from farmers who felt they could potentially be useful additions on farms where fenced-off buffer strips reduce stock access to the burn.

Besides demo farms, the project also introduced farmers to nutrient budgeting as a means of protecting the river. A simple, easy-to-use software program was created by the University of Hertfordshire to expedite calculations and assist farmers in completing nutrient budgets for each of their fields. With the assistance of project participants, 62 farmers in the Ythan catchment became acquainted with the software and successfully completed budgets for their farms. Moreover, local agricultural advisors were provided with the software in hopes that they will help other farmers create budgets after the project's completion.

Another project initiative aimed at reducing agricultural pollutants in the River Ythan is the creation of un-cropped and/or un-grazed strips of land adjacent to watercourses. These strips act as a ""˜buffer' between the farming activities in the main field and the watercourse, offering some protection from pesticide-spray drift, animal manures, loose soil etc. Farmers are normally unwilling to create these strips without some form of incentive, but the Scottish Rural Stewardship Scheme now offers financial recompense for the lost land included in a buffer strip. Therefore, the project was able to secure the cooperation of 200 farmers who agreed to initiate the application process for compensation under the RSS.

Besides interfacing with farmers, the project also conducted restoration activities to improve the riparian environment along several reaches of the river. 

 -  At the Gight Woods site, a 5.3-hectare stand of Norway spruce was felled between July and September 2003. The trees were planted along the river in the 1960s and had been damaging fish habitat and compromising bank structure. Because the site is part of the river's floodplain it was decided that the brash from the tree felling could not be left to rot as at most felling sites. Instead, the branches and other brash were gathered into large piles and burnt on-site in order to reduce the risk of their being swept downstream in a flood event. Subsequent to the spruce removal, volunteers planted 300 broad-leaved trees at the site.
 -  In the summer of 2003, a fish pass was installed at Haddo. The following summer, some weedy areas immediately downstream of the fish pass were dug out in order to open up fish access to the pass. Large sea trout have since been seen upstream, indicating that the pass is working as expected.
 -  Excavation took place at the Ythanwells wetland in 2003, and the site was replanted with appropriate vegetation. Furthermore, a field drain was disabled to allow for greater inundation.
 -  At Fyvie castle, sycamores were removed in 2003 and 2004 to allow the establishment of ground flora on the banks, which should encourage greater flow diversity and reduced siltation. At the same site in September 2004, Japanese knotweed, an invasive species, was eradicated using glyphosate spray.
 -  In 2004, a fish ladder was built at Methlick to allow fish access to the upper stretches of the burn. With the ladder installed, the burn was restocked with juvenile fish by the Ythan District Fishery Board (YDFB).
 -  Fencing was erected at Chapelhaugh in 2004 to protect the site from further damage, and streamside erosion was addressed by planting trees and sowing grass seed. Branches from old Christmas trees were placed along the banks for protection until the newly planted vegetation could become established.
 -  A berm was created at a wetland site in July 2004. Practitioners excavated a wetland shelf and removed concrete reinforcing before installing coir matting to protect the new banks. With these alterations complete, volunteers replanted the site with a wide range of wetland species, and the spoil area was seeded with a damp grassland seed mix. 
 -  In August 2004 at Cairnfechel, Udny, an obstructive concrete weir creating blockage was replaced by a stepped weir built with locally-sourced rocks and minimal concrete. This new weir will allow fish passage and will improve hydrology, enabling the banks to return to a more natural state.
 -  Flow diversification was accomplished on the Burn of Keithfield in September 2004. Small rocks and boulders were placed at strategic locations along the burn to create pools and eddies in the flow. These hydrologic features increase the variety of flow types in the burn, thereby creating a greater variety of wildlife habitat.
 -  In 2004, bat and bird boxes were deployed at key riparian locations around the catchment by a group of volunteers. A total of 50 boxes was installed (20 bat; 30 bird) in an attempt to increase wildlife habitat.
 -  In 2004, a wetland shelf was built at Modley burn using the same methodology as described above.

With the help of local landowners, youth groups, and/or project volunteers, a total of 36 riparian sites have been planted with 2,257 broad-leaved trees. During the winter of 2002-2003, 10 sites were planted with a total of 409 trees. A further 16 sites were planted during the winter of 2003-2004 with a total of 1,015 trees, and in 2004-2005, another 10 sites were planted with 833 trees. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Significant changes in water quality in the River Ythan catchment may not be observed for many years. However, the actions taken in association with this project were highly successful in terms of involving a wide range of local community members and creating the potential for improvement in water quality and habitat conditions over time. The collaboration with farmers in the catchment area is especially promising, as nutrient budgets, water management plans and buffer strips created through the project will ultimately reduce suspended solids and nutrient loads in the watershed and thereby promote the gradual recovery of the ecosystem.
The Ythan Project was selected by the European Commission as one of the 25 best projects in Europe during 2005, a reflection of the hard work and dedication of the project volunteers, staff and partners. The collaborative approach demonstrated by this project is applicable in other geographic and social contexts; and the strategies for educating and assisting farmers can be of great utility in other such restorations. Already, there has been interest in the nutrient budgeting software from practitioners working on the River Dee in Aberdeenshire, the Endrick catchment of Loch Lomond and Tamil Nadu University in India.
The following is a list of important lessons learned as a result of project activities:
– The need for organisations involved in partnership projects to remain flexible.
– The need for organisations to be able to consider a range of issues broader than their own individual remits.
– The very real level of commitment and interest which exists in the wider community and which is often an untapped resource.
– The need to broaden the opportunities for involvement as much as possible.
– The successful involvement of the wider public in professional activities such as survey work offers a useful opportunity to increase participation and understanding.
– The requirement for a flexible funding system in order to allow full public participation in the decision making process.
– The increased time requirement when working with many stakeholders in partnership and when dealing with wider groups–such as farmers–on a oneâˆ’toâˆ’one basis. Although the estuary has RAMSAR status, this designation does not protect the site from the impacts of activities upstream or more general impacts such as pollution of the adjacent sea area. Designation as a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) will not protect the site either, as this designation focuses only on nitrogen and fails to address other pollutants (e.g. phosphorus and soil particles). Long-term improvement in the health of the river system is dependent to a large extent on the ability of the local community to assume responsibility and develop a voluntary response to problems facing the river. The public outreach activities conducted in association with this project aimed to form collaborative relationships among farmers, community members, environmental organizations, planning agencies, etc. and to encourage community involvement in watershed issues. As a result of project efforts, many more people have come into contact with the problems facing the river, and are becoming aware of the actions they can take as individuals to tackle some of these. Furthermore, by bringing land managers and members of the larger community together in a productive forum, the project has provided non-farming residents an opportunity to express their opinions and offer their input on the way local land is managed.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/mexico-wetland-restoration-at-three-sites-in-the-colorado-river-delta/	Mexico: Wetland Restoration at Three Sites in the Colorado River Delta	Mexico	1998-06-07	1998-06-07	"The Colorado River Delta, one of the largest desert estuaries in the world, has lost more than 80 percent of its wetlands over the last 80 years. Extensive damming and diversion of water for agriculture and development in the river basin have all but eliminated flow to the delta’s wetlands, and the resulting habitat loss poses a serious threat to wildlife populations and human communities dependent upon wetland resources for their livelihoods. The imperative to restore and conserve these imperiled ecosystems has led to increasing bi-national cooperation among Mexican and U.S. agencies and institutions, and has resulted in the formation of community-based restoration initiatives. Three such initiatives are currently underway in the delta, focusing on the restoration of marshlands, riparian stands, and mesquite bosque. Although differing somewhat in scope and scale, these projects all revolve around more efficient use of available water resources, most of which come in the form of agricultural drainage. Project planners view the willingness of local community members to lend their support and guidance to these restoration efforts as a significant stride toward realizing larger conservation goals in the region.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Wetlands in the Colorado River Delta have been reduced by 80 percent over the last 80 years due to water management practices in the Colorado River basin (Valdés-Casillas et al. 1998). The diversion of water for agriculture has been a major factor in the decline of the river system, but increasing population pressure has also played a role. The Colorado River is the main source of water for northwestern Mexico, the desert region of the southwest United States, and the southern California coastal plain. At present, the river supports more than 23 million people–21.5 million spread over 7 states in the USA and the rest in the states of Baja California and Sonora, Mexico (Carrier, 1991; CNA, 1997; Glenn et al, 1997). In order to meet these anthropogenic demands, some twenty dams have been constructed along the river’s course, and the resulting impoundment and diversion of water has created fundamental changes in hydrology and sediment movement. In fact, except for unusually high flood years, virtually the entire flow of the Colorado is now captured and used before even reaching the river’s mouth. Consequently, wetland habitats in the delta have shrunk, and many of the extant areas only survive due to brackish agricultural drainage. Indeed, “losses” from irrigation systems sustain the remaining 1,500 ha of cottonwood-willow stands (out of “tens of thousands” of original hectares) and the 6,000-hectare Ciénega de Santa Clara, the largest marsh in the Sonoran Desert and a protected natural area.
The loss of habitat has, in turn, led to a decline in avifauna populations in the delta. Ten species of breeding birds and fourteen species that use this area as stopover or wintering grounds have required a status of legal protection under Mexican laws (i.e. Endangered, Threatened, or Special Protection; Diario Oficial de la Federación 2002). Moreover, populations of many species have declined regionally, and some have been extirpated locally, including populations of five breeding species and two wintering species (Hinojosa-Huerta et al. in press). Most affected have been riparian-obligate breeders, waterfowl, and marshbirds. There has also been major concern for the endemic subspecies of Yuma Clapper Rail (Rallus longirostris yumanensis) and Large-billed Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis rostratus; Mellink and Ferreira-Bartrina 2000, Hinojosa-Huerta et al. 2001a). Prior to the dam era, the cottonwood (Populus fremontii) – willow (Salix gooddingii) forest was very common in the Colorado River Delta, extending over tens of thousands of hectares throughout the Mexicali Valley (Sykes 1937). Thick mesquite (Prosopis spp.) bosque dominated the upland terraces, in association with arroweed (Pluchea sericea) and quail bush (Atriplex lentiformis) (Mearns 1907). Oxbows, backwaters, and seepage were common, and provided for vast extensions of marshlands (Sykes 1937).
One of the largest desert estuaries in the world, the Colorado River Delta provides important habitat for resident and migratory species of both waterbirds and shorebirds. Although anthropogenic impacts have dramatically reduced delta wetlands, it continues to nurture an abundance of avifaunal species. Between 1993 and 2002, 353 bird species were detected in the Colorado River delta in México (Patten et al. 2001, Hinojosa-Huerta et al. in press). The delta provides habitat for 24 protected Mexican species, for migratory and wintering waterbirds along the Pacific Flyway, and for neotropical migrant landbirds (Mellink and Ferreira-Bartrina 2000; García-Hernández et al. 2001; Hinojosa-Huerta et al. 2001a, 2001b; Diario Oficial de la Federación 2002). Nearly 200,000 shorebirds and 60,000 ducks and geese use the delta wetlands as wintering grounds or stopover habitat during migration (Morrison et al. 1992, Mellink et al. 1997), and at least 110 species of neotropical migratory landbirds visit the delta during their migratory movements (Patten et al. 2001). The goal of these projects is to reestablish the ecological functions of the Colorado River Delta through an efficient use of available water, and to thereby ensure the conservation of biodiversity and the preservation of the social and cultural values in the region.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The interest in restoring wetlands in the Colorado River Delta and allotting water for the environment has been increasing on both sides of the border (Valdés-Casillas et al. 1998, Pitt 2001). Opportunities for restoration have been identified (Briggs and Cornelius 1998, Luecke et al. 1999), and these ideas have been discussed in public forums incorporating environmental considerations into the political, social, and economic framework (Varady et al. 2001). An important result of these efforts is a binational consensus among stakeholders, agencies, environmental groups, and academia on the importance of developing and implementing a binational conservation/restoration program, based on robust scientific information that takes into account water requirements for wildlife conservation.
One major stride toward the realization of this goal is the incorporation of local communities in the process, in particular through representation afforded by the Ecological Association of Users of the Hardy and Colorado Rivers (AEURHYC). This organization was formed in 1998 by different sectors of the local communities of the Río Hardy to work together toward the restoration of the Colorado River Delta. The association includes fishermen, farmers, the Cucapá tribe, aquaculturists, and the tourist sector. In particular, members of the AEURHYC call for: 1) a reconsideration of water treaties, which will include considering the environment as another user of river water, 2) the designation of all delta wetlands under a protection status, and 3) the implementation of restoration projects (AEURHYC 2001). Slowly but steadily, government agencies in Mexico are recognizing AEURHYC as a legitimate representative of local interests and are according it a voice in the planning process.

Description of Project Activities: - Campo Mosqueda

The Campo Mosqueda site is in the Río Hardy wetland system, on the western side of the Colorado River Delta, and at the southern portion of the Mexicali Valley. The objective of the Mosqueda restoration effort is to re-establish 10 ha of wetland, mesquite and riparian habitat types on lands that were formerly used for agriculture. A nursery of native plants has been established to provide materials for the Mosqueda project as well as for subsequent riparian revegetation efforts.

The Mosqueda restoration effort is establishing three types of plant communities: a 0.5-ha open water zone with intermixed marsh areas dominated by cattails (Typha domengensis), bulrush (Scirpus americanus), and sedges (Juncus spp.); a 0.5-ha hectare riparian woodland dominated by cottonwoods and willows; and a 10-ha mesquite zone dominated by screwbean (Prosopis pubescens) and honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Approximately 1,000 mesquite trees have been planted on 15 acres at an upland site, and cottonwoods and willows have been planted along the agricultural drain adjacent to the campo. 

 - Laguna del Indio

El Indio wetland is located at the lower end of the Mexicali Irrigation District, in the buffer zone of the Upper Gulf of California and Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve, within Ejido Indiviso, Baja California. El Indio is a 100-ha subtropical floodplain dominated by saltcedar (a non-native species), but includes other species of smaller stature, including arroweed (Pluchea sericea), seep willow (Baccharis salicifolia), saltbush (Atriplex spp.), and iodine bush (Allenrolfea occidentalis). In addition, pockets of cattail, bulrush, and other hydrophytes persist in areas where soils remain saturated throughout the year. Salt grass (Distichlis palmeri and D. spicata) forms significant patches on the salt-affected wetland fringes at the south end of El Indio.

These lagoons are part of an old stream of the Colorado River on the eastern delta; now they are supported by agricultural run-off water from the Mexicali Valley. These wetlands were created when a drain broke in 1993, flooding about 90 hectares as water was retained between a flood control levee and an agricultural drain. The restoration project is focusing on a rectangular portion of El Indio (roughly 1,650 m long and 220 m wide) that occupies about 36 ha.

Currently, the activities at El Indio are aimed at securing a source of water for these wetlands, and exploring the opportunities of water re-use for environmental purposes and some economic activities, in particular ecotourism and small-scale aquaculture. Key elements of this project include: 1) management of agricultural drains to enhance water availability in the lagoon; 3) saltcedar (Tamarix) removal in areas that contain significant amounts of native wetland species; and 3) community participation in the restoration design and in the development of local backyard projects that will address both community and environmental issues.

 - Río Hardy Wetlands

The current appearance of the Río Hardy wetlands began to be shaped during the 1930's, when several consecutive flooding events created a natural dam or sandbar 35 km upstream from the Gulf of California that blocked the flow of water from the western delta (Glenn et al. 1996). The sandbar maintained a 20,000 ha marsh in the Río Hardy even during the 50-year period when Lake Mead and Lake Powell were filling and there were few or no flows to the region (Glenn et al. 1996).

One of the activities of AEURHYC is the construction of a dike in the lower part of the Río Hardy that will maintain a larger wetland area, increase river depth, and restore habitat for migratory waterbirds and associated wildlife. The general idea of the AEURHYC project is to simulate the functions of the sandbar, evaluate the feasibility and potential environmental benefits of the project, and to generate information on the hydrologic variables of the river in relation to the dike. The 120-m dike will restore approximately 1,500 ha of marsh, extending over 25 river kilometers.

The first phase of the dike was built during July and August 2001, using sandbags as the main material. The primary force was the participation of more than 80 volunteers from different communities on the delta, and the continuous involvement of the Indigenous Cucapá Community. A second phase was finished in August 2002, in which the dike was extended to reach higher terraces and increase the area to be restored. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Because these projects are ongoing and recovery is gradual, no data has yet been collected to ascertain the extent of recovery to date. Major milestones at this stage have been largely the collaborative and promising relationships that have taken shape between Mexican and U.S. stakeholder agencies and institutions and the willingness of local communities to actively participate in these restoration projects.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Delta communities have witnessed environmental changes in the wetlands and negative impacts to their livelihoods over the past decades (Valdés-Casillas et al. 1998). Nevertheless, the natural revegetation and maintenance of wetland areas with agricultural drainage water has maintained community interest and hope for conserving a functional ecosystem. Community support has sparked interest in starting restoration efforts that could function as models to obtain information for management of the delta ecosystem, and that could explore the possibilities of using agricultural drainage water, irrigation water, private and ejido lands, and marginal fields for environmental purposes. A more integrative system of land management will ultimately be of much benefit to local communities, whether dependent upon agriculture, fisheries, eco-tourism, or a combination.
The community-based projects in the Colorado River Delta show that diverse habitat types can be re-created or improved through restoration work. These restoration efforts should be expanded as part of an overall conservation strategy for the Colorado River Delta. That being said, it is unlikely that bird populations can be sustained through localized restoration actions only. The ecological integrity of the riparian and wetland ecosystems of the delta needs to be maintained as well. An overall bird conservation strategy for the delta should find alternatives to large-scale destruction of wetlands and riparian forests, while creating islands of high-quality habitat at suitable sites through restoration projects. These efforts should be coupled with the support and interest of local communities working toward the long-term recovery and conservation of the desert wetlands of the Colorado River Delta. A local monitoring program has been developed and implemented, integrating traditional knowledge and support from members of the community. The program focuses on monitoring birds, vegetation, and fluctuations in water levels. Key communities involved in the program are Ejido Luis Encinas Johnson and the Cucapá community. Several community members have provided their expertise on the local geography and ecology and received training to participate in monitoring activities. The program includes marshbird surveys; point counts for riparian birds; banding to monitor productivity, survivorship, and migration of land birds; and surveys for yellow-billed cuckoos and willow flycatchers. Three hundred forty survey stations and two banding stations are operational. Vegetation and habitat surveys are also being performed throughout the year at specified sites.
Although the interest and involvement of local communities in the conservation of the delta has been encouraging, to significantly improve the delta’s wetland, riparian, and inter-tidal areas, the management of the Colorado River must meet the ecological needs of these ecosystems. This means allowing the occasional large spring flow to pass through the delta in order to re-work sediments and create conditions ideal for natural regeneration. It also means guaranteeing smaller, yet consistent, flows that keep the wetland and riparian ecosystems moist during the hot, dry months of the summer.
Calculations based on vegetation analysis suggest that even 1 percent of the natural flow of the Colorado River could provide the means for conserving and enhancing riparian and wetland areas in the delta. Ideally, a hydrologic management system would be created to provide a continuous flow that would maximize the number of days with discharge larger than 2 m3/s (4 X 107 m3/year). This would be complemented with pulse floods every 4-5 years at 80-120 m3/s (3 X 108 m3/year) to foster recruitment of native plants, wash salts, and rework sediments in the floodplain (Glenn et al. 2001, Zamora-Arroyo et al. 2001).
The socio-political situation is such that achieving these relatively modest flows will be challenging. Numerous steps involving social, political, and ecological considerations will have to be taken before the United States and Mexican governments, delta residents, and other stakeholders can agree on what the overarching goal of restoration is, and which strategies would be most effective in accomplishing the restoration goals.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/united-kingdom-wales-restoration-of-the-river-dulais/	United Kingdom: Wales: Restoration of the River Dulais	United Kingdom	2003-01-06	2006-01-06	"The River Dulais in Southwest Wales was the site of a restoration project implemented by the Environment Agency Wales (EAW) to increase bankside vegetation and curb extensive streamside erosion resulting from livestock grazing. Although conventional methodologies would require the use of stone revetments and other costly interventions for this type of restoration, EAW opted instead to utilize less-intrusive bioengineering techniques that would counter the erosion while encouraging natural re-vegetation and overall enhancement of habitat value. Thus, coir rolls, live willow bundles, and rootwad revetments were used in varying combinations with fencing and bank grading in order to tailor intervention measures to particular stream-reach characteristics and erosive processes operating thereon. Living bundles installed as part of the project have exhibited high rates of survival, and colonisation by natural vegetation has exceeded prior expectations. EAW is pleased with the outcome of the project and is using it as a test site to demonstrate the efficacy of these techniques.Agriculture & Livestock The River Dulais is typical of many rivers in the area, where unrestricted grazing, mostly by sheep, has resulted in a loss of bankside vegetation, reduced cover for fish, bank/bed instability and increased erosion. – Stabilise reaches of highly mobile channels using diverse bioengineering/soft revetments.
– Enhance physical habitat structure to benefit fish, primarily migratory salmonids.
– Allow subsequent natural channel readjustment (e.g. natural narrowing of over wide reaches and self cleansing of gravel bed).
– Demonstrate that bioengineering techniques (i.e. soft engineering) can be used as an alternative to blockstone in mobile gravel-bed rivers to control erosion whilst restoring physical habitat to degraded channels and thus helping to guarantee the sustainability of fish stocks in Wales.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Traditionally, blockstone revetments would be used in higher energy rivers to control bank erosion. However, blockstone removes any scope for marginal grasses and trees to establish, thus lowering the ecological value of the river and also reflects the flow of water, which causes additional instability downstream.

Environment Agency Wales was keen to demonstrate that softer bioengineering methods could be used that would control the extensive erosion, whilst maintaining geomorphological processes, and enhancing the physical habitat of the river.

Salix River & Wetland Services was hired to conduct a detailed geomorphological survey in order to ascertain the erosion processes at work, rates of planform adjustment, estimated discharge at bankfull, and the estimated erosive energy potential of the river by calculating stream power and shear stresses applied to the bed and banks of the river during bankfull events.

Salix also provided a detailed design plan for restoring the river using bioengineering techniques. In order to maintain and enhance local biodiversity all living plant material was harvested from the Dulais and adjacent catchments. The desired vegetation types were deemed to be a mix of marginal grasses (Phalaris arundinacea, Juncus effusus) and tree cover (Salix cineria & Salix fragilis).

Several bioengineering techniques were employed based on the local reach-scale erosion process, water depth and stream power. For example, in reaches with slack bed gradients, and therefore reduced stream power, simple low cost techniques were used, such as bank grading and toe protection using live willow bundles (faggots/fascines). The entire reach was fenced in order to keep livestock off the banks.

In deeper areas, outer meander bends and reaches with steeper bed gradients, and therefore more erosive energy, more robust techniques were used. Whole upturned tree roots with 2 metres of trunk still attached were installed to act as physical revetments and also deflect flow away from eroding banks. In total, some 40 large tree roots were installed in the deepest and most unstable reaches. All the trees used were grey willow (Salix cinerea) and, as such, have started to grow, providing excellent habitat and cover.

The following is a summary of specific techniques used in different reaches, according to the characteristics of the particular reach:

 -  For reaches with a bed gradient of 0.011-0.014 and an average bankfull velocity of 2.1 m/s, pre-planted coir rolls were used.
 -  For reaches with a bed gradient of 0.015-0.018 and an average bankfull velocity of 2.5 m/s, willow faggots were installed.
 -  For reaches with a bed gradient of 0.019-0.022 and an average bankfull velocity of 2.95 m/s, live brush packing was used.
 -  For reaches with a bed gradient of 0.023-0.026 and an average bankfull velocity of 3.3 m/s, rootwads and brush packing were used in combination. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Approximately 90% of all living material planted has survived, and a diverse mix of other vegetation species has colonised. All parties involved in the restoration have been surprised by the rate of establishment of the bioengineering revetments and also the diverse range of bankside grasses and other species which have colonised around the tree roots. Indeed, after one year, the reaches have diverse bankside cover, cleaner gravels with less fine sediment, early stages of tree cover and channel geometry that is much closer to adjacent stable reaches of river.
The EAW is delighted with the results of this project and is using the project as a test site to demonstrate the use of sustainable river management techniques. The EAW is keen to demonstrate the (cost) effectiveness of these restoration techniques and, as such, is monitoring both fish populations (using fully quantitative electrofishing surveys) and habitat (HABSCORE) at these survey sites. Prior to commencement of the restoration work, three 50-m sites were monitored within the affected reach, and another three were surveyed upstream to act as controls. This baseline data will be followed with subsequent surveys in the spring/summer of 2006. Given the obvious improvements to in-river and bankside habitat, it is expected that these surveys will reveal an increase in fish populations at the site.
Besides erosion-control measures taken in association with this project, EAW has worked with local landowners over the last three years to fence off and protect some 4.9 km of the river. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/south-korea-restoration-of-the-cheonggyecheon-river-in-downtown-seoul/	South Korea: Restoration of the Cheonggyecheon River in Downtown Seoul	Korea	2003-07-01	2005-10-01	"Since the 1970s, the Cheonggyecheon River in downtown Seoul, South Korea was covered by a busy, multi-lane roadway and elevated highway. An engineering survey conducted in 2000 revealed structural weaknesses in these roads and indicated a need for a costly renovation project. In lieu of investing in this congested traffic infrastructure, the Seoul City Government opted to demolish the roads and restore flow to the river in order to improve the environmental and aesthetic state of the downtown area. A two-year project costing nearly $1 billion was thus begun in 2003, and the river was re-exposed and made the focal point of a larger urban renewal effort. Traffic was rerouted, bridges were built across the river, public parks and recreational space were created, and sites of historic and cultural importance in the general vicinity were renovated. In the two years since the project’s completion, more than 50 million visitors have flocked to the site, and investment in the downtown area has increased dramatically. Moreover, the reduction in traffic has resulted in a significant improvement in air quality and a decrease in local temperatures during the summer months. These improvements in environmental conditions have been accompanied by the return of several species of birds, fish and insects to the restored Cheonggyecheon. The enthusiasm and excitement engendered by this project have attracted the attention of cities elsewhere and have made it a model for other urban renewal efforts.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Degradation of the Cheonggyecheon River began in the fifteenth century with the deepening and widening of the river channel; the construction of a stone and wood embankment; the use of the watercourse as a natural sewer system; and increased sedimentation resulting from the deforestation of surrounding areas. Although regularly dredged and modified into the twentieth century, in the 1950s the river channel was still a seasonal stream where people went to wash clothes and where children went to play.
As Seoul slowly grew from being semi-rural to a vast, smog-bound East Asian metropolis, the Cheonggyecheon – which means “clear valley stream” – became little more than a sewer. By 1970, the riverside was lined with slums, and the water became progressively more polluted, having been first channelized and then topped with concrete. As urbanization and industrialization gained momentum and cars became more ubiquitous, the river bed was converted into a 6-kilometer roadway with a 5.8-kilometer, 6-lane elevated highway running above it. Prior to restoration, more than 168,000 cars traversed this stretch each day, and 62.5% of these were through-traffic.
The consequences of this congested transit system along Cheonggye Street had grown very serious. Air pollution–particularly criteria pollutants–was well above acceptable levels, and nitrogen oxide pollution exceeded the environmental air quality standard for Seoul. Moreover, levels of benzene, a carcinogenic Volatile Organic Compound (VOC), were also high. A health awareness survey of people living or working near Cheonggyecheon suggested that the residents were more than twice as likely to suffer from respiratory diseases compared to people in other areas (SDI, 2003A). In addition to air pollution, noise pollution along this stretch topped established standards for commercial areas and was a serious hindrance to a pleasant living and working environment. – To improve environmental conditions in the downtown area
– To create a focal point of both historical significance and aesthetic appeal
– To trigger long-term economic growth by attracting tourists and investors
– To aid in making Seoul a financial and commercial hub in the East Asian region

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Demolition work began on July 1, 2003, and the Cheonggye elevated highway was completely dismantled by October 5, 2003. The demolition of structures covering the actual stream began on August 18 2003 and were fully dismantled by December 30, 2004. In order to reduce noise and dust created during demolition, the city used diamond wire saws and wheel saws. A total 680,000 tons of waste was generated during the demolition work. Of this, 100% of the scrap iron and steel was to be recycled and 95% of the waste concrete and asphalt reused.

The Cheonggyecheon was restored as an urban stream with natural qualities, a human- and environment-friendly space with a waterfront and walks along the banks. Proper flood management was a top priority in designing the stream. In consideration of the increasing incidence of floods and the extraordinarily heavy volume of torrential rainfall during the summer months, the city built embankments that can withstand the worst possible flood expected to occur every 200 years. Furthermore, the minimum number of bridges was planned in order to allow maximum water flow during heavy rainfall, while several covering structures were installed in order to prevent dirty water from flowing into Cheonggyecheon during these heavy rains. 

Because Cheonggycheon is an intermittent stream (being seasonally dry), it requires additional flow to maintain a maximum 40-cm depth throughout the year. Therefore, more than 120,000 tons of water per day will be introduced into the Cheonggycheon Stream from three sources: groundwater, the Han River, and water processed at the Jungnang Sewage Treatment Plant. The targeted level of water quality is the 2nd class, BOD 3mg/l. The Jungnang facility will be expanded to treat a total of 1.95 million tons of sewage per day, but until the expansion takes place, most of the water will come from the Han River.

Project planners took several measures aimed at minimizing traffic congestion in this downtown area and ensuring adequate transit infrastructure in the absence of the Cheonggye motorway. On either side of the stream, 13.5m were allocated to accommodate sidewalks; two-lane, unidirectional roads; and loading/unloading zones. The newly designed traffic system limits left turns and U-turns in an effort to prevent traffic delays and protect the environment from car emissions. A total of 22 new bridges were constructed over the Cheonggyecheon, 5 of which are pedestrian bridges and 17 of which are motor vehicle bridges.

Besides traffic and flood control, public access to the new river was also an important consideration in the planning process. The restored stream will be accessible at 17 locations. Terraces and lower-lever sidewalks were built along the upper and lower reaches of the stream, and the mid-stream section was designed as a water-friendly space. River parks and public art were incorporated in several locations in order to provide a venue for performances and cultural events and to enhance the overall potential for public enjoyment of the new space.

Historic and cultural restoration of the downtown area was another important aspect of the project. Historic streets and buildings were slated for beautification, and the Gwangtonggyo Bridge, a bridge built over the Cheonggyecheon Stream in 1410, was restored to its original state at a cost of over $5.9 million. Gwangtonggyo had been buried 95 years ago when the construction for tram rails between Jongno and Namdaemun was begun in 1910. It was the biggest bridge in Hanseong (the old name of Seoul) during the Joseon Dynasty (1392~1910), and it is now functioning once more for the people's enjoyment. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: In spite of uncertainty about the ramifications this project would have for traffic patterns in the area, officials have been pleased with outcomes thus far. With the demolition of the old motorway, drivers were forced to find alternate routes, rely less heavily upon their automobiles for transportation, and/or begin using mass transit. The relative absence of infrastructure supporting large volumes of traffic, in combination with a redesigned bus system aimed at providing a viable alternative to car travel, has resulted in a dramatic decrease in traffic along this stretch of downtown. Consequently, air quality has improved considerably, and according to the Seoul Development Institute, the amount of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the area around the river has dropped by 19 percent. Moreover, the decrease in traffic and the creation of open space has lowered summer surface temperatures and curbed the heat island effect somewhat. In a recent study, researchers found that temperatures in the immediate vicinity of the river were on average 3.6ÂºC lower than places 400 meters away. A different study found that in 2003 (before restoration), a square meter of land received 300 to 500 watts of heat, whereas after the project's completion the amount of heat decreased to 100-150 watts. Aiding this cooling effect is an increase in wind speed and ventilation since the removal of the motorway. Researchers found that average wind speeds after the restoration were 50% higher than they had been in the same period before the project.

Besides having a mitigating effect on traffic, air pollution and the heat island phenomenon, the restoration of flow to the Cheonggyecheon has created environmental conditions more conducive to wildlife. According to a survey on the ecology of the stream conducted between March and April 2005 by the Seoul Metropolitan Facilities Management Corporation, 30 species of birds and 13 species of fish were present in the stream, an increase of 6 and 5 species, respectively, over the same period in the year prior to restoration. The return of marsh plants and clean water to the Cheonggyecheon has resulted in an increase in benthos and plankton, and these have, in turn, attracted several species of fish (e.g. carp, minnows, and fry) from the Jungnangcheon, another nearby stream. These improved conditions have brought several notable bird species, including: mandarin ducks, sparrow hawks, and Korean buzzards (a species listed as endangered by the Korean Ministry of the Environment), all of which were newly discovered in the area. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The restoration project only covers a portion of the Cheonggyecheon watercourse--the area from the Donga building in the CBD to the ending point of the covered road. Some ecologists argued that the restoration work should be extended to the upper reaches of the Cheonggyecheon, but due to traffic problems and costs, it was decided to exclude this stretch for the time being. Instead, pipes were installed between Cheonggyecheon and its origins, Inwangsan (Mt.) and Bugaksan (Mt.), to continuously provide clean water to the stream.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: When the public first learned of the idea to demolish the motorway and restore flow to the river, there was fierce opposition and protests from nearby vendors and business owners who depended on the area (and its heavy traffic) for their livelihoods. In the two years since restoration, however, the number of visitors to Cheonggyecheon River has surpassed 50 million, and community members have been happy about all the improvements they are witnessing. The area has begun to attract a growing number of tourists and investors, and property values and commercial activity are rapidly increasing. While the economic gain and renewed interest in development have been promising for many, there are some who fear that the renewal project poses a danger of gentrification and that local people will soon be unable to afford the rising costs of living and working in this area.
The successful implementation of this project, and the excitement it has created for residents of Seoul and members of the international community, has provided incentive for similar projects in Korea and elsewhere in the world. The new mayor of Seoul is considering a project along the Han River that would decrease space for cars and replace it with pedestrian walkways. Shanghai is also thought to be considering a similar, though smaller, scheme; and Tokyo has expressed interest in removing an elevated roadway above an ancient bridge. In 2006, the mayor of Los Angeles traveled to Seoul to see the project firsthand and discuss the possibilities for conducting a similar restoration of the Los Angeles River. The Cheonggyecheon River Project has become a showpiece for environmentalists and urban planners alike. To keep the river flowing, water must be pumped from the Han River and underground water reserves at a cost of more than 200 million yen a year. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/united-kingdom-england-the-rye-brook-restoration-project-in-ashtead-common/	United Kingdom: England: The Rye Brook Restoration Project in Ashtead Common	United Kingdom	1999-09-04	2004-09-04	"Decades of development pressures and flood control measures had resulted in the channelization and degradation of Rye Brook in Ashtead Common National Nature Reserve southwest of London. Consequently, in 1999 the City of London, in collaboration with several stakeholder organizations, began planning a project to restore natural processes to the brook and improve riverine and wetland habitats in the Common. Construction activities focused on restoring meanders to the straightened channel and creating a network of ponds and scrapes that would provide hydrologic complexity and enhance habitat potential for aquatic and avifaunal species. With the assistance of local volunteers, project managers also constructed a flow-control “wall,” using metal-mesh gabion baskets, that is intended to limit the flow of water downstream and allow the periodic inundation of the river corridor. By restoring more natural hydrology to the watercourse, project planners hope to stimulate the recovery of biodiversity along the brook and create a pleasant, inviting atmosphere for local recreational users.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Urban and agricultural development has had a negative effect on the Rye Brook, and a large portion of its natural catchment area is now occupied by housing. During the Second World War, a 365-metre stretch of the brook was straightened and channelised, and this alteration resulted in much-reduced biodiversity relative to other, more natural reaches of the watercourse. The Rye has gradually come to be seen as little more than a drainage ditch, and a number of surface-water sewage outfalls discharge into it along its course. Moreover, topographical surveys commissioned by the City of London in 2003 confirmed that the unnatural structure of the river channel and corridor reduce its capacity to hold water, making it particularly susceptible to flooding during periods of heavy rainfall. The areas of running freshwater habitat within Ashtead Common (such as the Rye Brook, seasonal streams, and boundary and drainage ditches) support a variety of aquatic vegetation, including Fool’s Water-cress (Apium nodiflorum) and Curled Pondweed (Potamogeton crispus). The Rye Brook supports breeding populations of Minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) and Three-spined Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). The Common Frog (Rana temporaria), Common Toad (Bufo bufo), Great Crested Newt (Triturus cristatus), Palmate Newt (Triturus helveticus) and Smooth Newt (Triturus vulgaris) are also known to be present in the network of ponds, streams and ditches. The Common is frequented by Adder (Vipera berus), Common Lizard (Lacerta vivipara), Grass Snake (Natrix natrix) and Slow-worm (Angius fragilis).
Within Ashtead Common, extensive areas of scrub grassland are frequented by a variety of songbirds, including: Blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), Chiff Chaff (Phylloscopus sibilatrix), Garden Warbler (Sylvia borin), Lesser Whitethroat (Sylvia curruca), Whitethroat (Sylvia communis), Willow Warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus) and Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella). Of particular interest are Bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrula), Linnet (Carduelis cannabina), Redpoll (Carduelis flammea) and Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos). The woodland areas support Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopus major), Green Woodpecker (Picus viridis), Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopus minor), Little Owl (Athene noctua), Nuthatch (Sitta europaea), Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), Tawny Owl (Strix aluco), Treecreeper (Certhia familiaris) and Woodcock (Scolopax rusticola), among others. Grey Heron (Ardea cinerea), Grey Wagtail (Motacilla cinerea), Kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) and Snipe (Gallinago gallinago) have all been recorded along the Rye Brook. – To restore and sustain natural processes in the river channel
– To improve and safeguard water quality in the river corridor
– To enhance and sustain biodiversity
– To increase flood storage capacity and thereby improve flood management
– To provide an attractive, accessible and safe river for community enjoyment
– To develop stimulating opportunities for teaching and learning and encourage community involvement in the project

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
During the promotion and development of the project, the local community was kept fully informed of progress by means of presentations, public exhibitions, guided walks, displays, newsletter articles, press releases and the City of London’s website. As project managers were also keen to involve the Ashtead Common Volunteers in the project, it was decided that the flow-control structure should be designed to use materials that volunteers could handle, without the need for extensive training or specialized machinery. The end result is a “˜wall’ across the watercourse, built by the volunteers, with 36 metal-mesh gabion baskets filled by hand with 54 tonnes of limestone. It is a structure volunteers can feel proud of whenever they see it or walk over it for years to come. This kind of direct participation in the project has afforded community members many opportunities to learn about river and wetland development, and it promises to continue providing educational benefits into the future.

Description of Project Activities: The City of London employed a river engineer to design a scheme that would reintroduce meanders to a 390-metre stretch of the river channel, lengthening it to 450 metres and creating the profile found in a natural watercourse. The new design was intended to encourage natural physical processes such as erosion, deposition of minerals and occasional flooding. To aid in the recovery of these processes and increase habitat diversity, contractors used heavy machinery to excavate a mosaic of ponds and scrapes (i.e. shallow pools) alongside the new channel, which will fill with water when the Rye floods over its banks. The improved wetland habitat and hydrological complexity afforded by these new features will enhance the entire river system.

Hydrologic modelling conducted in association with this project showed that the relatively steep watercourse would not flood a significant length of the river corridor. Therefore, the project was extended to include a degree of positive flood storage, resulting in the construction of 250 metres of embankment across the valley using material excavated from the ponds and scrapes. A flow-control structure--built using 36 metal-mesh gabion baskets filled by hand with 54 tonnes of limestone--was built across the watercourse with a short culvert passing through it to limit flood flows passing downstream and thus inundate the ponds and scrapes more frequently. This will reduce the 1-in-100-year flood peak flow from 1.50 m3/s to 0.85 m3/s. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The restoration of the Rye Brook river channel in 2004 re-established the natural topography of the watercourse. The new meanders and network of ponds and scrapes can hold 2,500 m3 of water and will potentially allow 1.5 hectares of the Common to flood. The processes of erosion and deposition are gradually aiding in the creation of a natural diversity of river habitats, such as pools and riffles, and these enhanced freshwater and wetland habitats are improving the quality of the entire river system and supporting a diversity of wildlife. It is still early in the river's recovery, but already Common Darters, Southern Hawkers, Kingfisher and Grey Wagtail have been seen in the area since the project was completed in September 2004. Restoring the natural channel has, in turn, provided a connection between the river and its corridor once again.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: One key focus of the Rye Brook Restoration Project was the provision of an open space for the enjoyment of local community members. The design of the new river channel, with its ponds and scrapes, took into account the safety of visitors by replacing the steep sides of the old ditch with shallow banks and constructing a boardwalk with handrails on top of the new flow-control structure. These considerations ensure safe, easy pedestrian access over the site. In addition, a short length of all-weather-surfaced track will link the public footpath to this flow-control structure and will create a viewing point from which visitors can enjoy the developing wetland. Measures such as these are intended to provide for public recreation at the site and to imbue local community members with a sense of pride and ownership in the newly restored river.
The improved river corridor will play an important role in contributing to the abundance and diversity of both aquatic and terrestrial habitats on Ashtead Common National Nature Reserve. In addition, the Rye Brook will provide a natural corridor, linking areas of semi-natural habitats and helping to sustain healthy and viable wildlife populations. Enhancing the river corridor and its floodplain has also increased the flood storage capacity of the Common by reducing the level and flow-rates of water in the main channel of the Rye Brook during peak flows and providing some flood alleviation for nearby residential properties. The lower flow-rates will reduce the risk of wildlife being washed away and will ensure the storage of floodwater on the Common, thereby providing additional wetland habitats. Improved biodiversity, resulting from the creation of new aquatic and terrestrial habitats in the river channel and corridor, will be enhanced further as the maturing habitats are colonised by a variety of flora and fauna. A smaller restoration project is now in the planning stages for 2006, to take place on a section of the Rye Brook adjacent to the area restored in 2004. "

Prescribed flooding projects have been conducted in the Zambezi River Basin of Mozambique; Pongolo River Basin of South Africa; Komadugu Yobé River Basin of Nigeria; and Senegal River Basin between Senegal and Mauritania. This project, managed by the Government of Cameroon in cooperation with the IUCN and other international partners, was undertaken in 1992 in northern Cameroon to rehabilitate the Waza-Logone floodplain using prescribed flooding of the Logone River downstream from Maga Dam. After two reflooding events–in 1994 and 1997–monitoring surveys showed an increase in the relative cover of perennial grasses that predominated before the dam’s construction and a decline in the relative cover of annual grasses that had predominated since. The return of a flood cycle (albeit an “artificial” one) and perennial grasses to the floodplain has had favorable consequences for the region’s wildlife and its human communities. Improved habitat has prompted the return of large avifauna populations, and rehabilitated grazing lands have been a welcome boon for transhumant villagers. While policy makers and local authorities are still attempting to strike a balance between conservation and development, the return of a functional floodplain affords many opportunities for improved livelihoods and greater ecological integrity in the region. Moreover, successes here promise to help guide similar initiatives elsewhere in Africa.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Since the 1950s, demand for irrigation water and electricity has resulted in the disruption of natural flooding regimes in river systems throughout Africa. In 1979, the Waza-Logone floodplain became yet another ill-fated system with the construction of an embankment along the Logone River and a dam forming Lake Maga. This dam, in combination with lower than average rainfall for the last two decades (Beauvilain 1995), has led to a significant reduction in the depth and extent of flooding over an area of 1500 km2, including Waza National Park. Consequently, productive perennial grasses have been supplanted by stands of annual grasses, limiting regrowth in the dry season and reducing the area’s carrying capacity for livestock, fisheries and wildlife (Scholte et al. 1996). Numbers of Kob antelope, for instance, dropped from 20,000 to 5,000 in the period 1979-1983, and declined further to 2,000 by the end of the 1985 drought. Ironically, the cultivation of irrigated rice, the main purpose for the Maga Dam, was largely a failure, as attested by the use of less than half of the irrigation scheme’s capacity and the continuing importation of rice. Pre-dam vegetation was dominated by the perennial grasses Echinochloa pyramidalis (antelope grass), Vetiveria nigritana (black vetivergrass), Hyparrhenia rufa (jaraguagrass) and Oryza longistaminata (long-stamen rice) (Wesseling et al. 1994). Other common grasses included: Sorghum arundinaceum, Dinebra retroflexa, Pennisetum ramosum and Ischaemum afrum. According to Barth (1857) and Nachtigal (1889), the levees along water courses were far more densely wooded in the mid-nineteenth century than nowadays, most probably with the same dominant species (Celtis africana, Ficus spp, Tamarindus indica), although some Sudanian tree species, scarce nowadays, were mentioned as well (Vitellaria paradoxa).
Vegetation maps of the entire area and Waza National Park, based on aerial photographs from the mid 1960s (Gaston & Dulieu 1976 and Wit 1975, respectively), indicate that presently inundated floodplain communities used to extend 10-15 km further west. Other sources (Letouzey 1968) indicate that inundation depth was formerly 1 to 2 metres, whereas at the present time it is <1 metre.
Fauna of the Waza-Logone area includes: elephants, Kobs, giraffes, Roan antelope, Red-fronted gazelles, lions, jackals, hyenas, and more than 370 different species of resident and migratory birds spread across eight habitat types. While many of these avifauna species are important components of the ecosystem, the endangered Black-crowned crane (Balearica pavonina pavonina) is considered the area’s “flagship” species. The project’s overarching goal is the hydrological and ecological rehabilitation of the floodplain in order to restore, to the extent possible, the physical conditions that existed before construction of the dam in 1979 (IUCN 1999).
The pilot reflooding experiment conducted in 1994 was intended to reinstate the natural flooding regime in an area of 600 km2 and to assess the rehabilitation capacity of vegetation disturbed as a result of the dam. Ultimately, these efforts are aimed at providing data for the evaluation of larger-scale reflooding options.

Monitoring Details: Pre- and post- flooding monitoring were major components of the project (see the Project Planning and Design, Key Lessons Learned, and Long-term Management sections for details). Ongoing monitoring is conducted by the Government of Cameroon and IUCN

Description of Project Activities: Studies conducted as part of the Waza-Logone Project in 1993 identified a number of reflooding options that were expected to have a major impact on the floodplain, including its human population. The pilot reflooding was initiated in 1994 by breaching an embankment that had blocked a former watercourse, the ""˜Petit Goroma.' Through this newly opened watercourse, an additional flow of approximately 20 m3/s streamed into the floodplain. In 1997, another watercourse, the Areitekele, located just south of the Petit Goroma was opened, triggering a further 8-10 m3/s inflow into the floodplain.

In order to evaluate the effect of this prescribed flood, extensive pre- and post-flood monitoring was conducted. Reference data had been collected along a 35-km transect in 1984 and 1985. The transect, consisting of six permanent plots each 20 x 50 m, started at the western edge of the floodplain, where Vetiveria nigritana (a perennial grass) used to be dominant but where annual vegetation had come to predominate (Wit 1975). The transect ended in the East in the well-inundated floodplain dominated by perennial grasses little changed since Gaston & Dulieu (1976) and Wit (1975). In the desiccated floodplain, 23 permanent 10 x 10 m plots were installed in a 1 x 0.5 km area around Tchikam.

From 1993 onward, prior to the pilot reflooding, vegetation monitoring was re-activated in the same Tchikam plots as in 1985 and at a number of additional plots. In 1993, the number of permanent plots in the transect was increased from six to 40, and the new 6 x 6 m plots were located at intervals of 0.5 km. Floristic composition was monitored in a newly installed 20 x 16 km grid, situated in the centre of the pilot-release impact zone, upstream from the transect and Tchikam plots. The grid had 136 (6 x 6m) plots located at a distance of 0.5 or 1 km. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The vegetation on the newly-inundated floodplain is typical of African seasonally-flooded grasslands, with its species-poor perennial stands (Denny 1993). The 1993-2000 monitoring, supported by field observations in 2002, indicates that in 2002 the perennial rhizomatous grasses Oryza longistaminata and Echinochoa pyramidalis occupied almost the totality of the reflooded area once again. Indeed, cover of perennial grasses in the reflooded zone, most notably these two species, increased from 41% in 1994 to 62% in 1997 and 75% in 1999 (a 7% annual average). The limited number of observations in the grid above the 1994 floodline did not allow a clear distinction in the perennial species' increase, although it seems to be initially only Panicum anabaptistum and Ischaemum afrum.

At the same time perennial-grass cover was increasing in the reflooded area, a decrease in the relative cover of annual grasses and herbs was also observed. Between 1994 and 1999, relative cover of these species decreased from 58% to 23%. Sorghum arundinaceum, an annual grass dominant since the mid-1980s, experienced an overall decrease in relative cover in the reflooded zone from 26% to 16% between 1994 and 1997, despite higher inter-annual fluctuations. In areas above the 1994 floodline, S. arundinaceum still fluctuated around 35%, but from 1998 onward, coinciding with the 1997 extension of the floodline, relative cover above the 1994 line dropped dramatically as well. 

If the conversion of annual to perennial grassland proceeds at the same rate as that observed in the period 1994-1999 (i.e. approximately 7%), the recovery of a 100% perennial-grassland state would be achieved after the 2003 flooding season.

In the period 1992-2000, the number of waterbirds observed during the dry season increased from 60,000 to 105,000. In this same period, 19 waterbird species were present in numbers surpassing 1% of their known population size (Wetlands International 2002). Furthermore, the number of species meeting this criterion in yearly observations doubled between 1992 and 2000. A few species surpassed the 1% mark in all years of the study period: White-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata), numbering up to 6% of its known population size; Black-crowned crane (Balearica pavonina pavonina) (up to 16% of its population); and Collared pratincole (Glareola pratincola) (up to 39% of its population). The Black-headed heron (Ardea melanocephala) colony, already of exceptional size before the start of the reflooding, tripled during the study period from 750 to a total of 2500 nests. This colony is now a multiple of the next largest known colonies. Because the increase in Ciconiiformes in Waza-Logone was not paralleled by similar trends in other West African floodplains, it is concluded that floodplain rehabilitation played a significant role. That being said, large piscivorous Ciconiiformes--Leptoptilos crumeniferus, Mycteria ibis and Pelecanus rufescens--enjoyed only limited increases, and this is attributable to the repeated destruction of their breeding colonies, resulting in a general population decline, as observed elsewhere in West Africa. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Vetiveria nigritana was dominant on the floodplain prior to construction of the Maga Dam, but it failed to regenerate after reflooding. A tussock grass, V. nigritana is dependent upon seed dispersal as its means of propagation. Whereas the tussock grasses Ischaemum afrum and Panicum anabaptistum, also dependent upon generative propagation, appeared as quickly as the dominant rhizomatous species, V. nigritana did not regenerate at all. The 1996, 1999 and 2002 monitoring showed V. nigritana tussocks to be in generally good condition, producing seeds in abundance in an area where vegetation cover is low, potentially permitting gap phase replacement (Van der Valk 1992). In the eastern part of the transect, where V. nigritana lost its dominant position to Oryza longistaminata and Echinochloa pyramidalis between 1985 and 1993 and despite the continuing flooding, it is assumed that the strong competitive nature of these species prevented its regeneration. However, further west in the transect, where V. nigritana used to be dominant and is still present in depressions, the lack of regeneration might be attributed to changes in the hydrological regime--namely, the late arrival of floodwater and/or the low sediment level of floodwater.

In spite of this project's efforts to restore the pre-dam hydrology through prescribed flooding, major changes in the river system's hydrological regime have persisted. Whereas floodwater from both the Logone River in the east and smaller watercourses draining the Mandara Mountains in the southwest once inundated the Waza-Logone floodplain, these smaller channels are now trapped by Lake Maga. Consequently, the flooding season is now shorter, and floodwaters from the Logone River arrive relatively late--particularly in the western part of the floodplain. In the Tchikam plots and the western portion of the transect, for example, floodwater does not arrive until late October, and by this time, the area has already dried up following the rainy season. Moreover, water traveling to this western area must flow over 40 km, through dense vegetation that reduces its speed and leads to a loss of sediment load, resulting in less fertile soil conditions and a lack of sediment downstream (Breen et al. 1988). It is thought that these changes in hydrology might explain the failure of Vetiveria nigritana to regenerate in some parts of the study area. 

The recovery of human-supported resources, such as grasslands for cattle grazing and heron nests protected by villagers, exceeds the increase in resources with which humans compete--i.e. Kob antelope and large piscivorous waterbirds. Human populations in the region have been quick to respond to the improved conditions and are out-competing wildlife in many cases.

The isolated Waza-Logone population of 4,000 Kob antelope had a limited capacity to increase before the reflooding--at most by an annual rate of 50% (i.e. 2,000 antelope). Thus, the ""˜reservoir' of 4.7 million cattle in the Conventional Lake Chad Basin (Martin et al. 1996), of which 200,000 visit the floodplain, represents a significant source of competition. A desire to redirect migration routes and take advantage of new resources has brought a growing number of villagers to the floodplain and threatens to increase grazing intensity to a point beyond which wildlife (in this case the Kob) cannot compete.

Some species of water birds have also suffered as a result of competition with the local human population. Among the water birds that showed a trend less than the general two-fold increase were the large, predominantly-piscivorous resident Marabou and Yellow-billed Storks. These species have come under increasing persecution from local fishermen, and their colonies have been repeatedly destroyed in many cases. Although this is a relatively recent development in Waza-Logone, it has been common elsewhere in West Africa for many years.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The Waza Logone project has not only improved the livelihoods of local communities by bringing back water, it has been active in numerous areas to create a movement for sustainable development. For example, conflicts between herders and agriculturists, once rife, have disappeared by negotiating new rules for transhumance and compensation for damages. The provision of clean drinking water has reduced water-borne diseases by seventy percent. Finally, the project helped set new rules for burning of grasslands to improve their nutritional value for cattle and wildlife, and remove parasites.
Floodplain rehabilitation should be conducted in a probing approach with simple and long-term (“˜continuous’) monitoring that allows interventions and regular redefinitions of targets. Because of expected imbalances in Conservation versus Development, appropriate mitigating measures should be prepared beforehand, e.g. by the designation of distinct areas for conservation and other competing land uses. In addition, one may consider zoning with exclusive rights for present local communities that form a social buffer against the installation of newcomers. Formal agreements on the exclusive use of resources may facilitate such measures. To enhance the efficiency of conservation, it will be important to increase the intervention capacity of protected area personnel well before major changes, such as those induced by floodplain rehabilitation, are undertaken. This often implies that institutional arrangements are taken up early. In the long term, one aspires toward a governmental commitment for conservation and local development in the way they have been mobilised in Cameroon for security in the late 1990s. In addition, one should strive toward more coherence between local, national and international conservation policies and interventions.
The following are five key lessons learned throughout the implementation of this project:
1. The importance of considering different response times of ecosystem components, and their implications for rehabilitation results
2. The difficulty of setting aside resources for conservation due to the tendency of plants and animals to distribute themselves evenly according to resource availability (i.e. the Ideal Free Pre-emptive Distribution Model)
3. The risk of human population build-up at the border of protected areas, a process accelerated by the integration of conservation and development
4. The need to secure the commitment of all parties in consensual protected-area management
5. The need to have adequate training for protected-area personnel and to ensure that all parties have effective capacities for intervention The large impact of the pilot reflooding stressed the need to strengthen the management of Waza National Park and its direct surroundings in order to cope with the rapidly changing situation, especially the arrival of pastoralists and fishermen to exploit the newly reflooded areas. A management plan was formulated in collaboration with local communities (sedentary as well as nomadic), protected area authorities, traditional and administrative authorities and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Experiences with the implementation of this management plan highlighted the incapacity of park personnel to deal with new forms of collaboration with local communities. This prompted the implementation of a training program at the Garoua Wildlife College for guards of the national parks in north Cameroon. Courses were developed to enhance the knowledge and skills of protected-area personnel and encourage dialogue with local communities to improve conservation of Waza-Logone and other protected areas in Cameroon and West-Central Africa.
One community-level approach tested in Waza-Logone was social fencing, where local communities exclude “˜outsiders’ from exploiting the surroundings of a protected area, an approach that is no longer taboo (Anonymous 2004). This was part of management agreements between protected-area authorities and local communities, where community management of a sensitive area was rewarded by exclusive exploitation rights, as well as other privileges like small-scale development assistance.

All told, the project will restore over 40 square miles of river/floodplain ecosystem, including 43 miles of meandering river channel and 27,000 acres of wetlands. Jointly managed by the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the project encompasses two primary components aimed at restoring natural hydroperiods and inundation patterns to the river and its adjacent floodplain: backfilling the C-38 canal (the channelized river’s main drainage) and changing water level management practices in the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes to maintain natural flow. The first phase of backfilling was completed in 2001 along approximately 12 km of C-38, and the results of post-construction monitoring surveys have been promising. While it is still too early to perform an accurate assessment of the impact on plant, fish, and herpetofaunal communities, initial observations following the restoration of flow to the channel suggest improvements in water quality (especially levels of dissolved oxygen); re-colonization by invertebrates and benthic species typical of flowing-water habitats (instead of those characteristic of lakes and other stationary bodies of water); and increasing densities of waterfowl and wading birds in the adjacent floodplain. Backfilling and construction activities will continue in the Kissimmee watershed until 2012, at which time an ambitious long-term management plan will be put into effect in hopes of preserving the dynamics of the river and perpetuating the ecosystem improvements that are realized.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Two major hurricanes in the late 1940s led to mass flooding and extensive property damage throughout the Upper Basin, prompting the State of Florida to petition the federal government to prepare a flood control plan for Central and South Florida. In 1948, the U.S. Congress authorized the USACE to initiate construction of the Central and Southern Florida (C&SF) Project for flood control and other purposes. The primary project goals were to relieve flooding and minimize flood damages within the Kissimmee watershed and to improve navigational opportunities originally provided in the Congressional Act of 1902. Between 1962 and 1971, the meandering Kissimmee River was channelized and transformed into a 56-mi (90 km) long by 30-ft (9 m) deep canal that varied between 90 and 300 ft (27 and 91 m) in width, and was regulated by a series of five water control structures (USACE, 1991). The areas between water control structures, termed pools, function similarly to reservoirs and are named for the control structure at their southern terminus. Upper Basin project features were constructed between 1964 and 1970 and included dredging of canals between lakes and installation of water control structures to regulate lake levels and outflow (USACE, 1991).
Although the C&SF Project was extremely successful at achieving its flood control objective, it dramatically altered hydrologic conditions throughout the Kissimmee watershed (Obeysekera and Loftin, 1990). Water levels in the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes (KCOL) are now controlled by nine structures that regulate the amount and timing of discharges between lakes and to the Kissimmee River. Under regulation, the range of fluctuation has been reduced from 2 to 10 ft (0.6 to 3.0 m) to about 2 to 4 ft (0.6 to 1.2 m) annually (Obeysekera and Loftin, 1990). The historical, pre-regulated pattern of seasonal fluctuations provided periods of flooding and drying that played a critical role in maintaining the ecosystem’s health and that supported biological communities adapted to and dependent upon these fluctuations (Perin et al., 1982). Reducing the range of fluctuations has eliminated this natural cycle and promoted growth of dense vegetation that has resulted in the accumulation of organic material in littoral zones of these lakes (USACE, 1996). Smaller fluctuations also have allowed agricultural, residential, and commercial land uses to encroach upon historic flood zones surrounding the lakes, resulting in significant loss of wildlife habitat and higher nutrient inputs to the lakes (USACE, 1996).
Within the Kissimmee River valley, the physical effects of channelization, including alteration of the system’s hydrologic characteristics, drastically reduced the extent of floodplain wetlands and severely degraded fish and wildlife resources of the basin (USACE, 1991). Approximately 21,000 ac (8,500 ha) of floodplain wetlands were drained, covered with spoil material, or converted into canal (USACE, 1991). No-flow regimes in remnant channels encouraged extensive growth of floating vegetation, which impeded navigation (Toth, 1990a). Senescence and death of encroaching vegetation covered the shifting sand substrate with large amounts of organic matter, greatly increasing the biological oxygen demand of the system (Toth, 1990a). By the late 1970s, floodplain use by wintering waterfowl had decreased by greater than 90 percent compared to pre-channelization levels (Perin et al., 1982). Diverse and abundant wading bird populations declined and were largely replaced by the cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), a species generally associated with upland, terrestrial habitats (Perin et al., 1982). The highly recognized largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) fishery was decimated, while fish species tolerant of low dissolved oxygen and reduced water quality, such as Florida gar (Lepisosteus platyrhincus), increased (Perin et al., 1982). Aquatic invertebrate taxa of the channelized system were typical of those found in lakes and reservoirs rather than riverine systems (Harris et al., 1995). Stabilized water levels greatly reduced river-floodplain interactions, disrupting critical food web linkages dependent on seasonal flooding and protracted floodplain recession rates (Harris et al., 1995). Prior to channelization, the dominant floodplain plant communities included: broadleaf marsh (dominated by Sagittaria lancifolia and/or Pontederia cordata), wet prairie, willow (Salix caroliniana), and buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis). These communities, especially wet prairies on the outer margins, supported large numbers and a high species richness of waterfowl (Audubon Society, 1936 – 1987; reviewed in Perrin et al., 1982). During eight years of winter surveys in the 1950s, a minimum of 12 and as many as 18 species of waterfowl were documented each year (USFWS, 1959). Bird species inhabiting the river and floodplain included four species that are currently listed as threatened or endangered by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. Of these species, three are wetland specialists (wood stork, endangered; snail kite, endangered; bald eagle, threatened), while the fourth (Audubon’s crested caracara, threatened) utilizes a matrix of terrestrial and wetland habitats (Sykes et al., 1995; Morrison, 1996; Coulter et al., 1999; Buehler, 2000).
In 1957, the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission (FGFWFC) collected 922 individual fish representing 24 species, and 11 families in Kissimmee River. Fish collected included both large (adults > 80 mm SL) and small-bodied individuals. The assemblage was dominated in abundance by small-bodied species (62.9 percent), especially golden shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas (39 percent). The remainder of the assemblage was comprised of largebodied centrarchids and esocids (35.7 percent) and a single catostomid (1.4 percent). Of the 329 centrarchids and esocids collected, 98 percent were juveniles or young of the year. The goal of the restoration project is to restore ecological integrity to the river-floodplain ecosystem. This goal is defined as the “reestablishment of a river-floodplain ecosystem that is capable of supporting and maintaining a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organisms having a species composition, diversity, and functional organization comparable to that of the natural habitat of the region.”

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: The purpose of the KRHRP is to provide the necessary water storage and regulations needed to approximate the historical flow characteristics for the Kissimmee River system. These purposes will be accomplished by increasing the water storage capacity of lakes Kissimmee, Hatchineha, Cypress, and Tiger by approximately 100,000 acre-feet (12,340 hectare-meters), and by increasing the conveyance capacity of the canals and structures to accommodate these increased storage volumes. Meeting these objectives involves (1) acquisition of approximately 20,800 ac (8,400 ha) of land bordering these lakes; (2) widening the C-36 canal between lakes Cypress and Hatchineha and the C-37 canal between lakes Hatchineha and Kissimmee; (3) adding two gates to the S-65 water control structure to increase the outlet capacity from Lake Kissimmee; and (4) modifying the stage regulation schedule for the S-65 structure.

The headwaters revitalization regulation schedule is zoned to provide varying discharges based on season and water level. Specifically, these modifications allow for a wider range of lake stage fluctuations, with maximum lake stages increasing from 52.5 ft (15.9 m) to 54.0 ft (16.4 m) National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). The new regulation schedule with increased maximum stage both provides for the reestablishment of pre-channelization seasonal outflow characteristics from Lake Kissimmee to the Lower Basin and benefits the lakes by expanding littoral zones and peripheral wetlands by approximately 14,000 ac (5,700 ha) (USACE, 1996). Additionally, the increase in the range of lake stage fluctuation is expected to improve the overall quality and productivity of littoral and wetland habitats.

To date, the C-36 and S-65 modifications are complete. The majority of lands that will be inundated as a result of increased stage on lakes Kissimmee, Hatchineha, Cypress, and Tiger have been acquired. The widening of C-37 is expected to be completed in 2006. The headwaters revitalization operation schedule will be implemented upon completion of the C-37 modifications.

The river restoration component requires the acquisition of approximately 68,300 ac (27,640 ha) of land in the Lower Basin and involves a plan to (1) backfill an approximately 22 mi (35 km) section of C-38 from the lower end of Pool D to the middle of Pool B; (2) reconnect remnant river channels by recarving sections of river channel destroyed during C-38 construction; (3) remove the S-65B and S-65C water control structures and tieback levees; and (4) evaluate restoration success through a comprehensive ecological monitoring program. Backfilling of C-38 and recarving of river channels will be implemented in a series of construction phases to be completed in 2012; evaluation of restoration success will continue through 2017. Ultimately, the project will result in restoration of approximately 104 km2 of river-floodplain ecosystem, including 70 km of continuous river channel. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Phase I construction of the KRRP was completed in February 2001. Approximately 7.5 mi (12 km) of flood control canal C-38 was filled in Pool C and the southern portion of Pool B. Nearly 1.3 mi (2 km) of river channel was recarved and water control structure S-65B was demolished. These efforts reconnected 15 mi (24 km) of continuous river channel and allow for intermittent inundation of approximately 12,000 ac (4,900 ha) ha of restored floodplain.

Phases II and III, scheduled for completion in 2012, will fill the C-38 in Pool D. Numerous smaller ditches and works in the floodplain must be leveled or removed, some structures must be modified, some levees rebuilt, and the Pool C structure will be removed. Highway 98 and its bridge in the floodplain were raised in 2003 to allow the braided river to pass under it. The 4th and final Phase of backfilling will involve the C-38 canal in Pool B. 

Initial responses to restoration activities in the Phase I area include: (1) maintenance of continuous flow for over three years in the reconnected river channel; (2) a reduction in the quantity and distribution of organic/marl deposition on the river channel bed; (3) an increase in the number of river bends with active formation of point sand bars; (4) an increase in the mean concentration of dissolved oxygen in the river channel from 1.2 to 3.3 milligrams per liter (mg/L) during the wet season and from 3.3 to 6.1 mg/L during the dry season; (5) a reduction in the mean width of littoral vegetation beds in reconnected river channels; (6) a shift in the structure of littoral plant communities from slight dominance by floating/mat forming species to heavy dominance by emergent species; (7) colonization by wetland vegetation of the filled C-38 and degraded spoil mounds; (8) colonization of mid-channel benthos by invertebrate species indicative of reestablished sand channel habitats; (9) dominance of woody snag invertebrate communities by passive filter-feeding insects, which require flowing water; (10) increased mean density of wading birds, including the endangered wood stork, from approximately 6 birds per square kilometer in the unrestored area to 20 to 24 birds per square kilometer in the restored area; (11) a decline in the abundance of the terrestrial cattle egret relative to aquatic wading birds on the floodplain; and (12) establishment of a new bald eagle nesting territory adjacent to the area of Phase I.

Following completion of Phase I, mean channel velocity at the three monitoring sites ranged from 0.113 m/s (0.371 ft/s) to 1.016 m/s (3.332 ft/s). Of the 88 measurements, only 33 (43 percent) were in the desired range from 0.244 to 0.549 m/s (0.8 to 1.8 ft/s). While this range of mean channel velocities in the restored river channel does not yet meet established criterion, it does show substantial improvement over the baseline period, when the remnant channels are assumed to have had a mean channel velocity of zero most of the time.

Mean thickness of organic/marl deposits ranged from 0 to 11 cm. The highest values occurred at two transects located in MacArthur Run. Upstream of these two transects, a side channel was created during a high flow event that diverts most of the flow back to C-38. Mean thickness averaged 4 cm, which was a 71-percent decrease from the baseline value and was lower than the reference condition. The percent of samples on a transect lacking organic/marl deposits ranged from 9 to 96 percent. The average value of 64 percent was an increase of greater than 2,000 percent over the baseline value of 3 percent. Thickness at the thalweg ranged from 0 to 34 cm and averaged 4 cm. This average value represents a decrease of 81 percent from the baseline value, and was less than the reference value of 9 cm. Despite the inclusion of two transects downstream of the flow diversion in MacArthur Run, all three metrics used to describe river bed deposits exceeded the response suggested by the reference values. This decrease in the amount and extent of coverage by organic/marl deposits on the river channel bed exceeded the response expected based on the reference condition. While this study shows a clear transition from river channel organic/marl deposits to sand, it did not distinguish between changes caused by erosion and those caused by in situ burial.

Point bar formation on meander bends was evaluated after nine months of continuous flow by reconnaissance from boat. In the area of Phase I, 63 meander bends were found with active point bar formation. This number is a substantial increase over the baseline period, where no evidence of active point bar formation on meander bends was found in aerial photography in the area of Phase I. However, the initial response value was not as high as the reference value of 80 meander bends with point bars that was determined from aerial photography of the same reach of the river collected at low water prior to channelization.

Within the channelized river, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were frequently below 1 mg/L throughout the water column at all times of day. During 1996 - 1999, mean DO concentrations in remnant river runs in Pool A and C were 1.4 and 1.2 mg/L, respectively, during the wet season, and 3.1 and 3.3 mg/L, respectively, during the dry season. DO concentrations exceeded 2 mg/L for 22 percent of the baseline period, and 5 mg/L for 6 percent of this period.

Following completion of construction for Phase I of the restoration, mean daytime DO concentrations within the restored area were 3.3 mg/L during the wet season and 6.1 mg/L during the dry season. Post-construction DO concentrations in the control area (Pool A) were 1.1 and 4.5 mg/L during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Mean daily water column DO concentrations were > 2 mg/L for 85 percent of the time. Dissolved oxygen concentrations within one meter of the channel substrate were > 1 mg/L over 50 percent of the time.

Initial responses to restored flow and habitat structure under the interim regulation schedule have been positive for mid-channel benthic and snag-dwelling invertebrate communities. Within three years of restoring continuous flow (June 2001 - June 2004), dominant benthic invertebrate taxa include native clams (Musculium/Pisidium/Sphaerium complex) and characteristic sanddwelling chironomids including Cryptochironomus spp., Tanytarsus spp. and Polypedilum spp. and numerous microcrustaceans. Other native bivalves, including Popenaias buckleyi and Anodonta spp., also have been collected in low numbers. Although never collected during the baseline period, empty shells of P. buckleyi and Anodonta spp. were observed along the river margin in Pool C. Corbicula fluminea, a nonnative clam, has greatly increased in numbers since reestablishing flow. Aquatic invertebrate community structure and functional group associations on large woody debris (LWD) also have shifted since reestablishing flow. Taxa characteristic of enriched lentic habitats and tolerant of low levels of dissolved oxygen have been replaced by taxa characteristic of free-flowing blackwater streams of the southeastern U. S. Preliminary analyses indicate dominance by passive filtering-collectors including Cheumatopsyche spp. (Trichopetra: Hydropsychidae), Cyrnellus spp. (Trichoptera: Polycentropodidae) and Rheotanytarsus spp. (Chironomidae). Recolonization by hydropsychid caddisflies and other passive filtering-collector taxa are consistent with restoration of biological integrity and recovery of the food base.

Use of river channels by waterbirds has changed following restoration. For example, prior to backfilling in Pool C, anhingas accounted for 6 percent of all river channel waterbird observations; following backfilling, anhingas averaged 15 percent of observations in 2001 - 2002, and 31 percent in 2003 - 2004. The total (as opposed to relative) number of anhingas using restored river channels also has increased. Laterally flattened fish such as sunfishes and bass are important food items for anhingas in Florida (Frederick and Siegel-Causey, 2000); increased use of restored river channels by anhingas may signal increases in the availability of centrarchid prey. During the baseline period, only two species of shorebird were recorded. However, following the first backfilling phase, an additional eight species returned to the river/floodplain, including: American avocet, common snipe, greater yellowlegs, killdeer, three species of sandpiper, semi-palmated plover, and breeding black-necked stilts.

As a group, wading birds (excluding cattle egrets) have exhibited a strong numerical response to newly restored habitats on the Pool C floodplain. While annual densities of wading birds in Pool A have never exceeded 6 birds/km2 during the years following Phase I backfilling, densities in restored areas have averaged 20 and 24 birds/km2 during 2002 and 2003, respectively. Monthly densities of wading birds in the restored area have been as high as 57 birds/km2 and have exceeded 20 birds/km2 in 10 out of 21 post-Phase I surveys. The white ibis, which likely was the most common Kissimmee River wading bird species prior to channelization (Audubon Society, 1936 - 1987), had the highest counts in 12 out of 21 post-Phase I surveys. The primarily terrestrial cattle egret, which flourished after the majority of floodplain wetlands were converted to cattle pastures in the channelized system, has declined relative to aquatic wading birds on the restored floodplain. This species outnumbered all other wading bird species combined during baseline surveys, but averaged only 24 and 14 percent of total wading bird counts in 2001 - 2002 and 2003 - 2004, respectively.

The American wigeon, northern pintail, northern shoveler, ring-necked duck, and fulvous whistling duck were not seen during baseline surveys, but have been present following restoration. Winter densities of ducks in the restored area were 9.5 ducks/km2 in 2001 - 2002, and 3.1 ducks/km2 in 2003 - 2004; duck densities in Pool A during these years were 2.9 ducks/km2 and 1.0 ducks/km2, respectively.

The restoration of natural hydroperiods and associated ecological integrity of the floodplain is necessary before plant, fish, or herpetofaunal assemblage responses can be evaluated. Therefore, these communities have not been included in monitoring surveys to date. However, anecdotal information indicates fish use of inundated floodplain habitats since completion of Phase I backfilling. Abandoned pit nests have been noted on restored portions of the floodplain and adults of large-bodied species including Florida gar, chain pickerel, and bluegill have been observed during periods of moderate to high inundation. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: All project phases (i.e. I, II and III) are behind schedule due to land acquisition and modeling delays.
Successful completion of the KRRP, KRHRP, and KCOL LTMP has critical implications for other ecosystem restoration projects in South Florida. For example, the restoration project should increase phosphorus retention within the Kissimmee River system through restoration of floodplain wetlands, thus removing a portion of phosphorus loads that would otherwise reach Lake Okeechobee. Additionally, the KRRP is a prerequisite for successful completion of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Program (CERP). According to the future-without-plan condition under CERP, it is assumed that the KRRP is in place and functioning (USACE and SFWMD, 1999). The Kissimmee Chain of Lakes Long-Term Management Plan (KCOL LTMP) was initiated in April 2003 through a South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) Governing Board resolution (Resolution No. 2003-468). The purpose of this plan is to improve and sustain the ecosystem health of the regulated lakes in the KCOL, while minimizing adverse impacts to downstream ecosystems. The KCOL LTMP is intended to pick up where the KRHRP leaves off, as the KRHRP only includes lakes Kissimmee, Hatchineha, Cypress and Tiger, and does not address lake-level regulation in the 16 lakes north of Lake Cypress. Furthermore, KRHRP does not consider requirements for treatment of hydrilla (an invasive aquatic plant species) or lake habitat restoration and enhancement projects. The KCOL LTMP spans the entire watershed and will focus on how to regulate the KCOL and Kissimmee River in accordance with one another, while meeting flood control, water supply, aquatic plant management, and natural resource operations objectives for these systems and Lake Okeechobee. A coordinated, interagency project, the KCOL LTMP will contribute significantly to development of a watershed plan for the region by providing a scientifically based management strategy for the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes. It will be essential for addressing specific water quality needs that are not included in other watershed management programs already under implementation. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-new-mexico-restoration-of-bluewater-creek/	USA: New Mexico: Restoration of Bluewater Creek	United States of America	1984-08-28	1984-08-28	"Bluewater Creek, in the Cibola National Forest of northwestern New Mexico, is one of two primary drainages feeding Bluewater Lake. Extensive logging around the turn of the last century began a process of degradation that continued into the 1980s with intensive livestock grazing, uncontrolled fires and mining activity. In 1984, the USDA Forest Service began collecting and analyzing data about the creek’s watershed in order to better understand its hydrologic functions and the variables driving ecosystem processes. With this preliminary analysis complete, practitioners began implementing a range of channel treatments and interventions to affect flow regimes, channel stability, and water quality. Subsequent monitoring activities suggest that in-channel features are functioning as expected, and hydrologic conditions are creating habitat more favorable for wildlife. Adaptive management of this project will continue, and a complementary project to restore and enhance forested stands within the larger Bluewater Watershed is currently in the planning stage.Agriculture & Livestock, Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Between 1890 and 1940, extensive logging using narrow-gauge railroad technology cut over much of the Bluewater watershed. Extensive grazing of livestock, uncontrolled fires, and some mining activity also occurred. Following logging by private enterprises, large portions of the watershed were sold to the USDA Forest Service in the early 1940s. Grazing, some logging, extensive road building, and increased recreational use continued in the watershed. Avian species commonly found within riparian habitats in the Bluewater Watershed include: the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), Virginia rail (Rallus limicola), violet-green swallow (Tachycineta thalassina), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), broad-tail hummingbird (Selasphorus platycercus), belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon), northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), piñon jay (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus), Clark’s nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), Steller’s jay (Cyanocitta stelleri), common raven (Corvus corax), mountain chickadee (Parus sclateri), house wren (Troglodytes aedon), American robin (Turdus migratorius), and mountain bluebird (Sialia currucoides). The southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax trailii extimus), a neo-tropical migrant and riparian-habitat-obligate species federally listed as endangered, has also been documented as nesting within the riparian habitat associated with Bluewater Creek.
Mammal species commonly found within riparian habitats include: the deer mouse, piñon mouse, mountain cottontail, big brown bat, beaver (Castor canadensis), longtail weasel, coyote, red fox, gray fox, and mule deer.
Herpetofauna species include: the tree lizard, many-lined skink, western rattlesnake, southern spadefoot, red-spotted toad, and Woodhouse toad.
Finally, fish species found within streams associated with riparian vegetation habitats in the Bluewater Watershed include: rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brown trout (Salmo trutta), white sucker (Catostomas commersoni), central stoneroller (Campostoma anomalum), goldfish (Carassius auratus), and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). The effort has been based on five goals: (1) reduce flood peaks and prolong baseflows, (2) reduce soil loss and resultant downstream channel and lake sedimentation, (3) increase fish and wildlife productivity, (4) improve timber and range productivity, and (5) demonstrate proper watershed analysis and treatment methods. Also important is close adherence to a variety of legal requirements to preserve the environmental and cultural values of the watershed, particularly addressing the needs of threatened, endangered, and sensitive plant and animal species; preserving the rich cultural history of the area; and complying with requirements of the Clean Water Act.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: For analysis purposes, the watershed was divided into 13 subwatersheds and further stratified based on vegetation, geology, and slope. Analysis of data gathered measuring ground cover transects and channel analysis from August 1984 through July 1985 resulted in eight major conclusions: (1) areas forested with mixed conifer and ponderosa pine species were generally able to handle rainfall and snowmelt runoff; (2) excessive peak flows, as well as normal flows continually undercut steep channel banks, causing large volumes of bank material to enter the stream and lake system; (3) most perennial and intermittent channels were lacking the riparian vegetation they needed to maintain streambank integrity; (4) most watersheds had an excessive number of roads; (5) trails caused by livestock, particularly cattle, concentrate runoff into small streams and erodible areas; (6) several key watersheds suffered from livestock overuse and improper grazing management systems; (7) some instances of timber management practices were exacerbating watershed problems; and (8) excessive runoff in some subwatersheds continued to degrade the main channel. Based on the conclusions of the analysis, a broad range of treatments were prescribed and implemented. Some were active (e.g., construction of particular works or projects); others were more passive (e.g., adjustments to grazing strategies). Channel treatments such as small dams, gully headcut control structures, grade control structures, porous fence revetments, and channel crossings were used to affect flow regimes, channel stability, and water quality. Riparian plantings, riparian pastures, and beaver management programs were also established, and meander reestablishment and channel relocation were conducted. Land treatments, such as the establishment of best management practices (BMPs) for livestock, timber, roads, and fish and wildlife, were developed to prevent soil loss and maintain site productivity. In a few cases, land and channel treatments were implemented simultaneously (e.g., livestock drift fences and seasonal area closures). Additional attention was paid to improved road management practices, and unnecessary roads were closed. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Results of the project have largely met its goals, and the watershed is more productive and enjoyable for a broad range of goods, services, and values.

Most of the small in-channel structures are functioning as designed. The meander reestablishment has lengthened the channel and decreased gradient in a critical reach. The channel relocation project has just completed its first year, and initial results are promising. Beaver have established themselves along the main channel of Bluewater Creek, providing significant habitat for fish and wildlife, as their ponds capture sediment and moderate flood peaks. The watershed now provides a more varied and robust population of fish and wildlife species. Changes in road management have yielded significant results. Road closures have removed traffic from sensitive areas, and reconstruction of two key roads has reduced sediment damages to the stream. Special attention to road crossings of wet meadows has begun to rehabilitate scores of acres dewatered by improper crossings. Range management techniques (e.g., combined allotments, improved fencing, and more modern grazing strategies) are improving watershed condition. A limited timber management program on the federal property has had beneficial impacts on the watershed, but significant timber harvest on private lands provided a cause for concern, particularly regarding compliance with Clean Water Act best management practices. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Although one weakness of the project was the lack of a carefully designed monitoring and evaluation plan, observers generally agree that the completed treatments continue to perform their designed function, while additional treatments add to the success of the project.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Bluewater Creek and Lake provide the only opportunity to fish for trout and other coldwater species in the area. They also offer a unique opportunity for water-based recreation in an otherwise arid part of New Mexico. The local citizens who use the watershed have benefited from the improved conditions; recreation use continues to climb.
The Bluewater Watershed received the 1997 Chief’s Stewardship Award from the Chief of the Forest Service and continues to host numerous studies and research projects. The U.S. Forest Service, Cibola National Forest, Mt. Taylor Ranger District is currently in the planning stages of a forest restoration project for the Bluewater Watershed. Intended to improve overall habitat conditions in the watershed, the proposed project will treat stands of piñon-juniper, ponderosa pine, ponderosa pine-oak, and mixed conifer forest. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-colorado-little-snake-river-restoration-on-three-forks-ranch/	USA: Colorado: Little Snake River Restoration on Three Forks Ranch	United States of America	2000-06-27	2001-06-27	"The Three Forks Ranch in Routt County, Colorado was purchased by David Pratt in 1999. Upon acquiring possession of the property, Pratt hired Dave Rosgen of Wildland Hydrology to design and implement a restoration project aimed at improving the hydrology and habitat conditions of a 10.5-mile stretch of the Little Snake River flowing across his property. The largest privately funded river restoration ever undertaken in the U.S., the project included interventions to improve channel dynamics and water quality; streambank stabilization measures; and a host of habitat enhancement actions. Five years of post-project monitoring have shown that, despite higher-than-usual flows in 2005, the river is functioning as expected, and the fishery is benefiting from more dynamic habitat conditions.Agriculture & Livestock Three Forks Ranch has been an agricultural enterprise since the 1870’s, when gold played out at nearby Hahn’s Peak in Routt County. The river bottom, being fertile, easily accessible and irrigable, was overused and abused for many years. Overgrazing and haying resulted in the destruction of the willow community along the river banks. Bank degradation soon followed, and a near-irreversible cycle began. Over time, the river channel became wide and shallow, and stream banks became abrupt drops of 3-6 feet into the river. Each spring, snowmelt runoff added to the problem. Water temperatures increased and dissolved oxygen levels declined. These two factors, along with increased sedimentation, greatly reduced the fish habitat in the river. The restoration goals were to restore natural stream bank stability, establish woody riparian vegetation, greatly reduce bank erosion, create wetlands, and improve fish habitat.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Restoration of the Little Snake River consisted of three main components: modification of the channel to optimize hydrology; stabilization of the streambank to reduce of erosion; and improvement of habitat conditions for the river's fishery.

Hydrologic interventions included deepening and narrowing the channel in several places in order to decrease the width/depth ratio; restoring the natural sinuosity of reaches that had been straightened to facilitate irrigation or road building; and deepening pools in order to create lower water temperatures and increase dissolved oxygen levels. In places where the channel split its flow and both streambanks were eroding, the stream was realigned to occupy only a single channel in order to prevent excess streambank erosion and allow for revetment. 

Streambank stabilization and grade control structures were constructed on all stream reaches. Steep, eroded banks were removed in many places, and native cobble was used as a revetment in an effort to eliminate future erosion. Furthermore, approximately 22,000 large boulders were placed along about four miles of river in the form of Rosgen-designed structures--e.g., J-hooks, W-wiers, and cross-vanes--to divert the stream's energy away from the banks and toward the center of the stream. These rock structures also created pools for fish. In areas where the curvature of the channel was too severe, the curvature of the channel bends was reduced. When the massive reconstruction was completed, thousands of mature willows were transplanted on the outside of every meander bend to further stabilize the banks and to provide shade to reduce water temperature. Sods mats were also installed to prevent erosion along many sections of streambank.

Because recreational fishing represents a significant source of income for the ranch, structures designed to provide diversity of habitat--including rearing, spawning and all-season cover--were also installed on all the stream reaches. Converging rock clusters were used to provide in-stream cover in the presence of high bedload streams. The convergence/divergence maintains the scour hole and seams without the associated gravel bar formation. Side channels constructed in the floodplain were designed to have a variety of slopes and velocities. ""Beaver pond"" channels were designed to provide a 2-foot check every 200 feet in order to create a backwater channel with a constant flow-through diversion. Within the ponds, the depths were designed to be less than 3.5 feet, ranging in width from 40 to 100 feet. Small, Rosgen E4 stream type tributaries with low sediment yield feed the pond adjacent to the Middle Fork of the Little Snake River. Due to this condition, an in-stream pond was designed for native Colorado River cutthroat trout habitat. The outlet structure from the pond was designed as a drop-outlet drain to prevent migration of fish upstream into the system. 

Another major phase of the project was to create off-channel fisheries in abandoned river channels using oxbow lakes and interconnecting streams. Irrigation channels were converted to natural steams and ""constructed beaver dams"" formed oxbow lakes. Seventy-five acres of wetlands were created in this process, along with a diversity of aquatic and terrestrial habitat.

The following are measures taken on specific reaches of the river.

Restoration work performed on two miles of the main stem of the Little Snake River began at the confluence of the North and Middle Fork tributaries. Approximately 56 cross-vanes, 14 J-hook vanes, 3 ""W"" weirs and 402 converging rock structures were installed. Thirty-seven banks were stabilized with willow/sod mat transplants. 11,500 feet of side channel habitat was created using design criteria. Oxbow lakes were reshaped and/or created, and 42 ""beaver dam"" plugs for fish habitat in the hay meadow/floodplain and low terraces were constructed.

Restoration work was performed on 10.5 miles of the South Fork of the Little Snake River. Approximately 3 cross-vanes, 420 J-hook vanes, and 990 converging rock structures were installed. 155 banks or bends were stabilized with willow/sod mat transplants. 51,010 feet of channel were realigned using design criteria, and other miscellaneous rehabilitation efforts were completed. 

Restoration work was performed on 0.6 miles of the North Fork of the Little Snake River. Approximately 6 cross-vanes, 8 J-hook vanes, and 88 converging rock structures were installed. Five banks or bends were stabilized with willow/sod mat transplants, and 700 feet of channel was converted from a braided to a single-thread channel using design criteria.

Finally, restoration work was performed on 0.9 miles of the Middle Fork of the Little Snake River. Approximately 6 cross-vanes, 32 J-hook vanes, 1 ""W"" weir and 225 converging rock structures were installed. Two banks were stabilized with willow/sod mat transplants. 3,150 feet of side channel habitat was created using design criteria. Oxbow lakes were reshaped and/or created; one cutthroat trout pond was constructed; and 8 ""beaver dam"" plugs for fish habitat were created. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Despite higher-than-usual runoff duration and volume during 2005, the restored reaches throughout the project site remained stable and incurred no system-wide instability or large-scale channel adjustments. The majority of the structures continued to perform as intended, despite relatively long durations of high flows and shear stresses. After five years of observation, monitoring results indicate that the constructed project continues to successfully meet standard definitions of stream and river stability (Mackin 1948, Schumm 1977, Leopold and Bull 1979, Rosgen 1996, Biedenharn et al. 1997). As in other years, some channel adjustments inevitably occurred in 2005; however, these adjustments are not thought to exceed the range of variability observed in comparable, least disturbed natural systems of the region, particularly during system evolution to a new equilibrium state.

The restoration effort has clearly resulted in substantially more pool volume and deep-water habitat with improved potential for riparian shading, lower in-stream temperatures, and higher dissolved oxygen content. Scour by the high flows of 2005 maintained pool volume at a majority of the structures located throughout the project. These pools continue to adequately support the stocked trout population in each of the three major forks of the Little Snake and along the Main Stem of the river. Furthermore, there has been continuing development and re-establishment of riparian vegetation throughout the project due to streamside plantings and improved grazing practices.

In 2005, ambient temperatures and recorded stream temperatures at most locations in late summer were comparable to previous years. Fish were further protected from high water temperatures by the cold-water refugia provided by the deep pools created throughout the project. No substantial fish mortality was reported by Three Forks Ranch personnel who frequently observed the fish throughout the most critical summer period.

In the fifth full growing season following construction, vegetation continues to re-establish along channel margins and floodplain surfaces. Grasses and forbs are the primary vegetation types colonizing the banks and riparian zone. This is evident along most of the project, even along many of the reshaped gravel and cobble bars. Willows (Salix spp.) are the predominant woody vegetation establishing along channel margins, and gravel and cobble bars. Changes in the willow assemblages can be characterized in two general ways. First, many transplanted willows have experienced some dieback, but there is new growth at the bases of the plants. This was first noted in previous years along the project and new growth of transplanted willows has continued. We expect that, given relatively normal precipitation and flow conditions, these plants will continue to successfully regenerate with proper grazing practices. Second, willows are colonizing many of the exposed gravel bars and cobble bars. While many of the early colonizers have established in locations that will not support perennial vegetation over the long term (i.e., too low into the active channel where excessive periods of inundation and high shear stresses preclude long-term establishment), a large number of more suitable sites have been successfully colonized. These locations are expected to develop into an important functional component of the riparian community. Willow, grass, and forb establishment will increasingly contribute to the overall geomorphic stability of the channel, as well as improve the available cover for aquatic fauna, input coarse particulate matter for desirable aquatic insects, and reduce water temperatures through shading. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The restoration reaches, like all streams, continue to be influenced by upstream land management practices. Upstream of the South Fork restoration reach and beyond the Three Forks Ranch property boundary, existing grazing practices increase fine sediment loading and channel instability through continual disturbance of streamside vegetation and soils. The restoration reaches cannot be assessed without considering the overall watershed, and the potential effects of upstream grazing practices on downstream reaches are a continuing point of concern. A sediment trap constructed above the project on the South Fork will require periodic maintenance to ensure its long-term effectiveness.
An interesting sidelight of this project is the desire of some downstream neighbors to restore another sixteen miles of the Little Snake River. Three Forks Ranch has agreed to fund the Rosgen master plan for this next length of river and to help these neighbors obtain funding from governmental agencies. The Natural Resources Conservation Service, US Fish & Wildlife Service, Wyoming Game and Fish, and Colorado Division of Wildlife are all assisting in making the next phase of the project a reality. Three Forks Ranch is presently working with Wyoming Game and Fish, the Colorado Division of Wildlife and the US Forest Service to commit a portion of the project to aiding the Colorado River cutthroat trout. During the project, several ponds were created that can be easily isolated from the main flow of the river using fish barriers. These ponds have been offered to the above mentioned agencies for use as brood ponds to raise Colorado River cutthroat trout for transplanting elsewhere.
Because Three Forks Ranch has a large cattle operation, a high-intensity/low-duration grazing system in the South Fork had to be developed. The South Fork was split into five small pastures, which are used only in the spring. Approximately 2000-3000 yearlings are put in each of these pastures for durations running from 3 to 10 days, depending on the size of the pasture. This plan uses the South Fork early in the spring, allowing it to recover while there is plenty of growing season left. It is also the least destructive time of the year to graze the willow population. The cattle seem to spread out on their own this time of year when both the upland and riparian vegetation is green and lush, as opposed to later in the year, when only the riparian areas are green. Also, water is plentiful in the spring and cattle do not have to return to the South Fork for water. This system has worked well for five seasons now. The willow population is thriving. The weeklong hoof-shear has 51 weeks to heal before the cattle return, and the fishery in the South Fork has not been negatively impacted.
The North Fork, Middle Fork, and main stem have been removed from grazing for the last five seasons. However, ranch managers are contemplating some early spring or late fall use of these pastures also, in order to remove decadent grass populations and help regenerate growth. If deemed appropriate, these areas would probably be grazed once every three years. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/denmark-skjern-river-restoration/	Denmark: Skjern River Restoration	Denmark	1987-08-23	2002-08-23	"The Skjern River Nature Project is one of the largest restoration projects in northern Europe. This project, implemented through the Danish Ministry of Environment and Energy, restored a river valley that was drastically altered in the 1960s by an ambitious drainage project designed to convert a boggy mosaic of meadows, lakes, and reedbeds into arable land for cultivation. The once-meandering river had been straightened and channelized, and the valley’s rich diversity of habitats all but eliminated. Consequently, this project focused on restoring a natural, meandering river channel that would periodically inundate adjacent areas and thereby re-create the former mosaic of different habitat types. Construction was completed in 2002, and already an abundance of important bird, fish, insect, and aquatic plant species has returned to inhabit the site. The Skjern River is, once again, functioning as a sinuous artery supplying the hydrologic needs of diverse habitats that sustain a wealth of biodiversity.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Between 1962 and 1968, the Skjern River was straightened, deepened and embanked, and dikes and drainage channels were built to lower the groundwater level and enable the conversion to agricultural land. As meandering watercourses were replaced by long, straight channels and dikes, 4000 hectares of wetlands, meadows and heaths were gradually converted into an arable prairie. As floodwater no longer flowed overland, and as fertiliser was liberally applied, the floodplain began to act as a huge ‘source’ of nutrients, and was no longer a ‘sink’ for sediments. This had a disastrous impact on the fjord as it became silted up and polluted. Problems also arose in the drainage area itself. With exposure to oxygen resulting from cultivation and drainage, the peat-rich soil sank–more than 1 metre in a number of places–and drainage became ineffective. Furthermore, water turned bright red due to high concentrations of ochre, a toxin for fish and other oganisms. At the mouth of the river, where there was once a huge expanse of marshland (4,000 ha) and a variety of wetland habitats, wildlife once abounded. In addition to the thousands of migrating birds who used it as a stopping over point along the Western Palaearctic flyway, there were also stable breeding populations of bittern (Botaurus stellaris), black tern (Chlidonias niger) and corncrake (Crex crex). Other species, such as the otter and Atlantic salmon, were also relatively common. – To reinstate flow conditions of the Skjern River and remove unnatural barriers
– To improve the aquatic environment of RingkÁ¸bing Fjord and allow the river, fjord and sea to function as a single biological entity
– To enhance conditions for migratory fish
– To recreate a natural wetlands habitat of international importance
– To develop the leisure and tourist potential of the Skjern River Valley

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: The period 1987-1999 was dominated by public debate, scientific and technical surveys, land acquisitions, land allocations, legislation, planning, environmental information, etc. The actual construction phase was carried out in 1999-2002. During this phase, dikes around the long, straight watercourses created in the 1960s as part of the drainage project were removed, and the old channels were filled with soil. A new, meandering river course was excavated and has increased to 26 km the lower section of the river that was formerly only 19 km of straight channels. The restored river has been laid out with several outflows into the fjord, and in time, this will create a delta of approximately 220 hectares. 

In addition to the reconstruction of the watercourse, five drainage bridges and two pumping stations have been removed from the project area. Consequently, periodic natural flooding will be allowed once again, and contact between the river and adjacent riparian areas will thus be re-established. In order to protect surrounding fields and towns from the natural floods expected to occur inside the natural area, 1.5 km of new dikes have been built. Some sections of original dike have also been preserved, the most important being Skjern River's North Dike, which now forms the northern boundary of the natural area. 

The final stage of the project, completed in 2005, was the establishment of facilities for the public and for dissemination of information--i.e. walking trails and observation stations. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The overall project assessment is unambiguous: The nature restoration project has been successful. More than 4 km of new, meandering watercourses have been dug in the 2,200-hectare natural area. These new watercourses  -  parts of Skjern River, Omme River and GundesbÁ¸l River  -  have been returned as far as possible to their original winding routes. The length of the main course of Skjern River has increased from 19 km to 26 km.

The area now consists of an open river valley with meandering watercourses and a mosaic of meadows, shallow lakes and reedbeds. This environment provides perfect conditions for flora and fauna. The groundwater level is no longer being lowered by pumping, so the leaching of ochre sediment in the project area has virtually stopped. At high water, floods inundate the surrounding meadows, depositing nutrients emitted by agriculture and aquaculture facilities. These substances are effectively filtered and prevented from entering RingkÁ¸bing Fjord, where they would have a negative impact on the fjord environment and the fishing industry.

The project area now offers ideal conditions for flora and fauna and has already acquired great natural value. In fact, it has already grown into a bird site of national importance. Birds began arriving by the thousands almost as soon as the excavators left the area. Since then, no fewer than 212 different bird species have been registered in the area, and more are being added to the list all the time. The new natural area is an important staging post for many bird species on their way between their winter quarters in Southern Europe and Africa and their breeding grounds in the north and east. These migrant species include: lapwing, golden plover ruff and dunlin. The area offers particularly suitable breeding conditions for grebes, certain dabbling ducks, and birds of the reedbeds and marshes. While some species rely on the site as a breeding ground or stopover point on their migration, many species remain in the area year-round. These perennial species include: mute swan, coot, cormorant, grey heron, greylag goose, many species of duck, and others. In the winter large flocks of greylag geese, pinkfooted geese, barnacle geese and whooper swans can be seen.

The area also provides food for many different species of raptor. Marsh harriers breed in the area and can be seen hunting mice and small birds throughout much of the year. Osprey, white-tailed eagle and peregrine can be seen on their migration in the autumn and winter months. Other visitors include: hen harrier, kestrel, merlin and red kite. In the winter, the area is home to a large numbers of raptors that includes the buzzard and rough-legged buzzard.

Besides important bird species, the new natural area has also provided a home for otters. The watercourses contain a large number of the fish on which they feed, as well as good places to hide and breed. The otter is threatened in Denmark, but during the 1990s it spread to West Jutland where its success is attributable to the restoration of watercourses, reduced use of pesticides, and increased protection.

The restoration project has improved conditions for fish. The variety of watercourses has created better conditions for spawning fish and better conditions for fish fry as well. The removal of barriers has allowed access to other sections of the river system for certain species of fish, particularly the whitefish, which is a small salmon. The river now holds the typical species of rivers and lakes, such as river trout, perch, pike, roach, bream, stickleback, grayling, burbot and eel. There are several species that live in the fjord and spawn in the river, including smelt, whitefish, sea trout and salmon. The increasing number of salmon in the Skjern is a positive sign, as the Danish salmon is the only strain of wild salmon left in Danish rivers. Before this project, the salmon had almost gone extinct owing to the state of the environment.

Skjern Meadows have already acquired a fascinating and rich insect life, including three species of great international importance. The green snaketail (Ophiogomphus Cecilia) is a predatory insect that hunts in the air, catching flying insects such as flies, wasps, mayflies, butterflies and other dragonflies. It is protected in Denmark and covered by the EU's Habitat Directive, which means that it may not be caught or killed, and the sites where it is found may not be damaged or destroyed. The mayfly (Baetis calcaratus) is rare all over Europe, and is on the so-called Red List of species for which Denmark has a special responsibility. The same applies to the stone fly (Isoptena serricornis), because most of the world population of this species lives in Denmark. The improved quality of the river water has created good conditions for this species, which seems to be increasing.

Two very rare aquatic plants now thrive in the project area, and have been flourishing since the completion of the restoration: Coleman waterdropwort (Oenanthe fluviatilis), which is only found in West Jutland and Ireland, and floating water plantain (Elisma natans), which is threatened by extinction in Europe and only found at a few sites in West Jutland. The uncommon arrowhead (Sagittaria sagittifolia) often covers the surface of the water completely in some sections of the delta. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The project had as its original goal the establishment of 1600 hectares of grassland. However, only about 1200 hectares of grassland have been successfully established due to an increase in the area occupied by lakes and wetlands. Although grassland will not be as extensive as originally hoped, the increase in wetland area will be of great benefit to such important species as the spotted crake, avocet and bittern.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The last phase of the project was the establishment of recreation facilities in the project area. The site has attracted a growing number of visitors, and by the end of the project, it was estimated that 350,000 to 400,000 people had visited the site. The 17.4 km of trails and 3 observation towers make the site accessible and allow for the enjoyment of the area's birdlife without much disturbance or negative impact.
The Skjern River system is the largest in Denmark and drains a substantial portion of the country’s land area before flowing into RingkÁ¸bing Fjord. This entire water system, and the surrounding area, should be seen as a single biological entity: the Skjern River system, RingkÁ¸bing Fjord and the North Sea. Fish provide an illustrative example of the interdependency of these seemingly distinct systems. Many species live in the sea and the fjord but spawn in the river and its upper tributaries. In order to survive and reproduce, these fish need clean water and easy access to suitable spawning grounds. Thus, the river is integral to the health and vitality of both the fjord and the sea. Therefore, the restoration project, despite having only affected a small part of the total water system, has had a significant impact on the flora and fauna further up the river system and in RingkÁ¸bing Fjord. A proposal for establishment of the Skjern River National Park has been sent to the Danish Minister of the Environment. This was the result of a joint initiative involving the project’s beneficiaries, municipalities and local/regional NGOs. National park status would facilitate the protection and effective management of the site and ensure its vitality into the future.
For the longâˆ’term sustainability of the project’s results, especially with regard to birdlife, it is essential that the wetland and meadow area are grazed. This includes Kalvholm Island, which is situated between the northern and southern branches in the outlet area of the river. A special barge was constructed for the transport of cattle to this island. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-arizona-fossil-creek-watershed-and-riparian-restoration/	USA: Arizona: Fossil Creek Watershed and Riparian Restoration	United States of America	2004-08-22	2010-01-22	"Fossil Creek is a spring-fed, travertine-forming riparian area in northern Arizona that is home to several endangered species of native fish, as well as many important species of birds, mammals and herptofauna. A diversion dam built in the early 1900s to supply water to two hydroelectric stations diverted almost the entire flow of the creek and drastically altered the ecosystem. In 1999, Arizona Public Service (APS) signed an agreement to decommission its hydroelectric facilities along Fossil Creek and allow the restoration of full flow to the streamcourse. In preparation for this measure, the Native Fish Renovation Project was implemented to eradicate nonnative species from the stream and help strengthen populations of native fish. The successful completion of this project and the ongoing deconstruction and restoration activities along the creek offer hope that this unique watercourse will soon be restored to its former splendor.Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The Childs Power Plant was built in 1909 on the banks of the Verde River and was one of the first hydroelectric power plants in the West. Electricity generated there was used by the mining industry in the Jerome area, and by large irrigation companies and individual farmers in the Verde Valley to run pumps to irrigate thousands of acres of land. In response to increasing power demands by the end of 1914, precipitated by the high price of copper and the revival of the mining industry, the Irving Power Plant was built at Fossil Creek in 1916.
Childs-Irving project facilities begin at the Fossil Springs Diversion Dam, a 25-ft high concrete structure, located approximately 0.2 mile below the lowermost spring of the Fossil Springs vent complex. This dam diverts almost the entire spring-supplied baseflow (nearly 46 cfs) of Fossil Creek into a system of flumes, siphons, penstocks, a reservoir (Stehr Lake), and turbines associated with the power generating facilities. Approximately 0.2 cfs leak through and around the Fossil Springs Diversion Dam and maintain perennial flow in a 3.4-mile reach of Fossil Creek from the Fossil Springs Diversion Dam to the Irving Powerhouse (the Irving Reach).
Not only have hydrologic disturbances been deleterious to the Fossil Creek watershed, the introduction of nonnative fish species has also threatened the ecosystem’s integrity. Since the early 1900s, at least 40 species of non-native fish have become established in the Gila River Basin in which Fossil Creek is located. Many of these non-natives were purposefully introduced to increase the diversity of the sport fishery, and some were accidentally released as bait or ornamental fish. Regardless of the mode of arrival, non-native fishes have had a detrimental affect on native aquatic species. The introduction and proliferation of non-native aquatic species, especially fish, is increasingly viewed as one of the most serious long-term threats to the recovery of native species, equaled in severity only by the effect of habitat destruction. Nonnative species have made their way into Fossil Creek, probably moving upstream from the Verde River. Green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolemieu), flathead catfish (Pylodictis olivaris), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and yellow bullhead (Ameiuris natalis) have all been found in the stream. Crayfish (Orconectes virilis), another nonnative species, has also established itself in the stream. Eight biotic communities have been documented from the Fossil Creek – Lower Verde River 5th code watershed: chaparral, desert scrub, grassland, mixed conifer, pinyon/juniper, ponderosa pine, ponderosa pine/Gambel oak and riparian, totaling 203,715 acres (USDA Forest Service 2003a; Table 10). The dominant community in the watershed is pinyon/juniper (128,483 acres), followed by riparian, ponderosa pine and desert scrub. Due to the elevational changes between Fossil Springs (4100 ft) and the confluence at the Verde River (2600ft), the vegetation of the upland canyon slopes changes from pinyon/juniper at Fossil Springs to desert scrub below Irving (Goodwin 1980). The dominant upland vegetation near the Childs Power Plant consists of prickly pear (Opuntia engelmannii), velvet mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii), buckhorn cholla (Opuntia acanthocarpa), and paloverde (Cercidium microphyllum). As elevation increases, the dominant vegetation includes velvet mesquite, catclaw acacia, prickly pear, shrub liveoak (Quercus turbinella), desert ceanothus (Ceanothus greggii), pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), banana yucca (Yucca baccata), and golden-flowered agave (Agave chrysantha). At the highest elevations, pinyon pines increase in dominance, and mormon tea (Ephedra viridis), birch-leaf mountain mahagony (Cercocarpus montanus) and pointleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos pungens) are common (Baker Engineering 2002a).
The Fossil Creek riparian area has been divided into 5 different sections for management purposes (USDA Forest Service 2003a). Zone 1 is located above Fossil Springs where stream flow is intermittent. In this area riparian vegetation is sparse and low in diversity with scattered Arizona sycamores (Platanus wrightii) dominating the riparian trees. The understory is comprised mostly of upland species and is very sparse. Zone 2 consists of the intact riparian corridor from Fossil Springs to the Diversion Dam. Diversity of riparian tree species is high in this area, and ash (Fraxinus velutina), alder (Alnus oblongifolia) and Arizona walnut (Juglans major) predominate (Sayers 1998). Other tree species occurring throughout the riparian area are boxelder (Acer negundo), Arizona sycamore, willow (Salix sp.) and netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata). Grasses and ferns are the second most prominent group of plants in this zone, followed by shrubs and other herbaceous vegetation. The understory above the Fossil Springs Diversion Dam also contains a variety of shrubs, including chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana) and smooth sumac (Rhus glabra).
Fossil Creek is one of a few streams in Arizona retaining viable populations of six native fish species, including: headwater chub (Gila nigra), roundtail chub (G. robusta), speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus), longfin dace (Agosia chrysogaster), desert sucker (Pantosteous clarki), and Sonora sucker (Catostomus insignis). These native fish are among the most threatened groups of organisms in the southwest, primarily because of water diversions and the introduction of nonnative fish. Over half of Arizona’s fish are listed as endangered or threatened.
Besides important fish species, the Fossil Creek watershed supports over 175 known species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and terrestrial invertebrates. Four birds federally listed as threatened or endangered are known to occur, or have existing or potential habitat, within the Fossil Creek watershed. These are the threatened bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida), and the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii) and Yuma clapper rail (Rallus longirostris yumanensis). Habitat (as well as one documented observation) for the yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus occidentalis), a federal candidate for listing, occurs in the watershed as well. Other common bird species are: black hawk (Buteogallus anthracinus), Bell’s vireo (Vireo bellii), warbling vireo (Vireo gilvus), yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens), Lucy’s warbler (Vermivora luciae), summer tanager (Pirangra rubra), hooded oriole (Icterus cucullatus), hairy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), and western wood pewee (Contopus sordidulus). Many of the birds in the Fossil Creek area are neotropical migrants from Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean that spend only a portion of each year in the area.
Game mammals in the Fossil Creek area include: elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, bear, mountain lion, bobcat, gray fox, coyote, javelina, cottontail and jackrabbits, squirrels, and raccoons. Elk are primarily found in mixed conifer and pondersa pine woodlands during the spring, summer and fall months but move into pinyon-juniper woodlands during the winter, especially when deep snows preclude access to forage in the higher country. Deer, mountain lion, bobcat, coyote, fox, cottontails and jackrabbits occur throughout all biotic communities within the Fossil planning area. Javelina occur in desertscrub, grassland, riparian, and chaparral and pinyon/juniper slopes with abundant prickly pear cacti. Raccoons occur primarily within riparian and other vegetative zones within close proximity to riparian areas.
Non-game mammal species include: chipmunks, mice, rats, woodrats, skunks, ring-tailed cats, and numerous species of bats. Spotted and striped skunks occur primarily within riparian and other vegetative zones within close proximity to riparian areas. Cliff chipmunks, white-footed mouse, and white-throated woodrat are a few small mammal species that occur within the chaparral and pinyon-juniper habitats. Rock squirrel, cliff chipmunk, western harvest mouse, and brush mouse are other small mammals that likely occur in the Fossil Creek watershed.
Amphibian and reptiles in the Fossil Creek area include: several species of toads, frogs, lizards, and snakes. Amphibians include canyon tree frogs and lowland leopard frogs. Numerous species of lizards occur in the area: collared, fence, earless, side-blotched, and tree. Sonoran mud turtles are also present in Fossil Creek (pers. comm. Cecilia Overby to Michele James). Snake species that occur in the area include: various garter snakes such as the black-necked and wandering; whip snakes; king snakes; gopher (bull) snake; and rattlesnakes such as the black-tailed, Arizona black, and Western diamondback. – To facilitate ecosystem recovery by restoring full flow to Fossil Creek
– To revitalize the native fishery in a region where native fish are increasingly rare

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: In preparation for the restoration of full flows to Fossil Creek, a fish renovation project commenced in the late fall of 2004. The Bureau of Reclamation in cooperation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, and the Forest Service, constructed a fish barrier approximately 5 miles upstream from the confluence with the Verde River. This barrier is designed to keep nonnative fish in the Verde River--e.g. smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolemieu) and flathead catfish (Pylodictis olivaris)--from traveling upstream and negatively impacting the native fish. The stream between the fish barrier and the Fossil Springs Diversion Dam was treated with a piscicide to eradicate populations of nonnative fish. Native fish salvaged prior to the application of the piscicide were then repatriated to the stream in an attempt to restore a natives-only fishery to Fossil Creek.

Fish were captured using backpack electrofishers, baited hoop nets, trammel nets, seines and minnow traps during October 11-15. Fish intended for salvage were held in live cars placed along the stream course and were transported to the holding facility on October 15 by helicopter long line in 55 gallon drums.

Transportation of captured fishes from the stream to the holding facility and back following renovation was accomplished in a variety of ways. For remote areas inaccessible by vehicle, a helicopter was employed to carry a 208 L drum on a long line. The drum contained a battery-powered aerator for providing supplemental air while fish were in transit. Fish carried inside the drum were segregated by size into two separate mesh bags. Upon setting of the drum on the ground the bags were removed from the drums and placed in a tank mounted in the bed of a pickup and driven several hundred yards to the holding raceways. In accessible areas, biologists carried fish to hatchery trucks in 19 L buckets and drove them to the holding facility.

The holding facility consisted of twelve circular raceways, independently plumbed and provided with available auxiliary oxygen supply, if needed. A continuous flow of water was provided via a 2-inch high pressure (~240 psi) line fed directly from the penstock of the Irving hydroelectric turbine. Water pressure was lowered via a pressure reduction valve to about 80 psi and plumbed through 1.5 inch PVC pipes to each raceway. Outflow from the raceways was directed via 2-inch lines to a dirt holding basin or to the creek.

Fintrol was selected as the piscicide for several of its qualities. First, it works at a much lower concentration 10-25 parts per billion (ppb) than the alternative, rotenone, which is generally applied at 1 part per million (ppm). Second, rotenone is ineffective on eggs, whereas antimycin is toxic to eggs and all life stages of fish and the toxic action is irreversible (Berger et al. 1969). Finally, rotenone has been shown to cause avoidance reactions in fish (Dawson et al. 1998), and the complexity of habitats found within the target reach of Fossil Creek would likely provide numerous opportunities for fish to avoid rotenone.

Application of Fintrol-concentrate to the stream was accomplished using 19 L buckets modified to flow at a constant rate. A 19 L bucket design modified slightly from Stefferud and Propst (1996) was used. Expected discharge rates were used to calculate amount of Fintrol needed to charge each bucket for a 4-hour exposure period. All field crews were sent into the field with pre-measured individual containers of Fintrol for charging each of their buckets based on flow measurements made the previous evening. Backpack sprayers were used during this renovation project to apply Fintrol-concentrate to margins, backwaters and other slow-moving stream habitats. Backpack sprayers were also recharged with prepackaged containers of Fintrol-concentrate. Fintrol-15, an antimycin coated sand grain designed to treat standing bodies of water or stream pools of great depth and volume, was applied directly to deep stream pools, stream margins, densely vegetated areas, and backwaters by hand. All major pools (â‰¥1 M depth) in Fossil Creek treatment reaches were measured prior to application to determine how much sand formulation was needed to establish the target concentration of antimycin.

Detoxification of Fintrol was accomplished by applying a 2.5% solution of potassium permanganate in Reaches 1-2 and 20% solution of liquid sodium permanganate in reach 4. Application occurred at 3 ppm to allow for 1ppm natural environmental oxidation, 1ppm for neutralization of the Fintrol and 1ppm for residual travel downstream from the end of the targeted reach. Application of the permanganate was accomplished using a 113L closed head drum for dispensing. The drum had been modified similar to treatment buckets but with larger size brass fittings to allow for increased dispensing rate.

Green sunfish were collected from the target reach during salvage efforts the prior week and held in live cars until the treatment began. These fish were then transported to live cars placed 200 meters below the neutralization station to monitor and confirm effective neutralization of the toxicant. In addition to operation of the neutralization station, a return of about 6 cfs of water by the Irving power plant to Fossil Creek 100 meters below the waterfall further served to dilute the instream concentration of antimycin. Survival of sentinel fish below the target reach confirmed that toxicant effects did not extend beyond the area intended.

Following application of the piscicide, a follow-up survey was conducted to ensure that all nonnative fish had been eliminated from the watercourse. Electrofishing using a backpack electroshocking unit was used primarily in shallow (> 1 meter deep) riffle areas in an upstream direction. Sampled habitats were randomly chosen and a minimum of 90 seconds or 150 meters were shocked in each distinct habitat type. We deployed baited miniature hoopnets (50 X 100 cm, 10 cm throat, 6 mm nylon mesh), within each priority area for separate ~24 hour hauls. Each net was baited near it's cod end by attaching a nylon mesh bag (30 x 30 cm, 6 mm mesh) containing AquaMaxTM Grower 600 for Carnivorous Species (Purina Mills Inc., Brentwood, MO). All captured fish were identified to species and measured in mm for total length (TL). Snorkeling surveys were conducted using two individuals side by side in the water doing independent identification and counts. Counts were repeated three times, compared for consistency and averaged for a single value. Only 1 green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) was found during this survey, so treatment was deemed effective and was not repeated.

Once nonnative species had been eradicated, the native fish from the holding facility were reintroduced. The Bureau of Reclamation helicopter was fitted with a 100-foot-long cable. The native fish were placed in a 55-gallon drum, and the drum was attached to the cable. The drum was then airlifted upstream and gingerly lowered to the boulder-strewn creek side, where waiting biologists placed the fish in buckets and hand-delivered them back to their Fossil Creek home.

On June 18, 2005, the Childs and Irving power plants were decommissioned, and full flow was restored to Fossil Creek.  Deconstruction and removal of power plant facilities--i.e. tunnels, flumes, buildings, Stehr Lake, etc.--has started and will continue through June 30, 2010, at which time APS will turn over the land and remaining facilities to the US Forest Service for management.  Concern arose about the sediments behind the dam and whether the restored river would flush the sediments out without harming downriver plants and animals. Because any attempt to manually remove the sediment would be very costly, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decided to require a 14-foot lowering of the diversion dam (slated to occur in 2007) in order to allow the sediment to naturally disperse downstream during flood events. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: In September 2005, almost one year after the completion of the fish renovation project, several stream reaches within the treatment area were sampled to assess the impact of the intervention. No non-native fishes were detected, and five native fishes--headwater chub, roundtail chub, speckled dace, Sonora sucker, and desert sucker--were present. These species occurred primarily as young-of-year accompanied by a few, larger adults, indicating successful reproduction and recruitment since the project's conclusion in autumn 2004.

Only one fish species, Sonora sucker, was present in the lowermost reach, and its abundance was low compared with upstream reaches. Because all post-project repatriation sites were upstream of Irving, Sonora sucker apparently was the only species that had dispersed downstream by the time of the monitoring survey.

The deconstruction of hydropower facilities has been ongoing, and APS crews have now removed more than 5000 feet of steel flume on wood trestle and more than 5400 feet of concrete / steel box flume. They have drained Stehr Lake and have successfully removed all infrastructures at the Childs Power Plant site. The diversion dam will be lowered as planned in 2007. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Longfin dace were absent from the monitoring survey conducted in September 2005. This species was known to occupy Fossil Creek historically, and also at the time of project implementation, and if it is not found during the next monitoring period, it could be necessary to reintroduce it from an appropriate, geographically nearby population. Such a reintroduction could be simultaneous with the introduction of other species, including the threatened loach minnow Tiaroga cobitis and spikedace Meda fulgida, which were deemed suitable for the stream in the Environmental Assessment developed for the project (FERC 2004).
Restoring full flow to the Fossil Creek watercourse is intended to facilitate natural regeneration of the ecosystem. Because this will be a gradual process, the full effect of this restoration will not be known for several years. Representative Rick Renzi and Senator John McCain introduced a bill on July 28, 2006 to designate Fossil Creek in the National Wild & Scenic Rivers System. This designation would recognize the watershed’s “remarkable geology, ecology, fish, wildlife, cultural and scenic values,” and would protect the free-flowing condition of Fossil Creek, ensuring that it is never dammed again.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/israel-alexander-river-restoration-project/	Israel: Alexander River Restoration Project	Israel	1995-08-21	1995-08-21	"The Alexander River Restoration Project is Israel’s leading river restoration and was awarded the Thiess International Riverprize in 2003. Implemented by Israeli agencies, with cooperation and support from local Palestinian officials in an unprecedented show of solidarity, the project aims to restore a river severely degraded by untreated sewage and pollution from more than 70 sources–in both Palestinian and Israeli territory. Thus far, project activities have centered around creating water treatment infrastructure to eliminate pollutants from the watershed and constructing public parks and recreational facilities along restored stretches of the river. These measures have precipitated a significant improvement in water quality and an overwhelming show of public support and interest in the restoration. The Alexander River has become a source of local pride, a magnet for visitors from all over the region, and a bridge between Palestinians and Israelis.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Two central problems have plagued the river for years: pollution from a variety of domestic, agricultural and industrial sources and development pressures in the open space surrounding the river that threaten its potential for leisure and recreation uses. The Palestinian City of Nablus is located at the source of the Alexander River, and the city has no sewage solution. Thus, the city’s raw sewage flows into the river and causes severe pollution. In all, some 70 sources of pollution are discharged into the Nablus Stream, which flows through the Palestinian Authority, and then into the Alexander River. Another 25 different pollution sources plague the river from the Israeli side. – To address the sources of pollutants causing the degradation of the Alexander River
– To facilitate the ecological rehabilitation of the river’s flora and fauna, with special attention given to the rare and protected Nile soft-shell turtle (Trionyx triunguis) and to the preservation of its breeding sites along the river.
– To protect the open spaces along the river and enable leisure and recreational activities in combination with agriculture

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
In order to promote the river restoration process, the Alexander River Restoration Administration involves senior sources on the national, regional and local levels — e.g. ministers, Parliament members, authority leaders, organizational chairmen and general managers, etc. Furthermore, the administration has made public involvement in all levels of planning and implementation a top priority. Project activities are conducted via a transparent process of intense public participation guided by the slogan “Returning the River to the People,” and both children and adults are deeply involved at all levels.

Description of Project Activities: In 1995, a comprehensive master plan for the restoration of the whole Alexander River Basin was prepared by an interdisciplinary planning team headed by Architect Amos Brandeis. This master plan, having been approved by all 20 partners, provides a foundation for the restoration project and includes goals, strategies and an action plan.

The implementation phase began in 1998 with several projects aimed at restoring the river. These projects address a wide variety of restoration issues, including: removal of pollutants, management of the water supply, restoration of targeted sections of the river, overall ecological rehabilitation, drainage and flood defense, development of river parks (i.e. including a ""demonstration project""), construction of a pedestrian and bicycle path along the river, education and public involvement, etc. 

Pollution Mitigation --  To stop the discharge of pollution/sewage from the Palestinian Authority (via the Nablus River) and from the Israeli towns of Netanya and Kfar Yona, an ""emergency solution"" was implemented in 2002 until such time that a joint treatment plant--which will treat wastewater from both the Palestinian side and the Israeli side--can be established. In the first stage, the polluted water is pumped from the riverbed adjacent to the ""green line"" (i.e. the dividing line between the Palestinian Authority and Israel) and undergoes extensive treatment at the purification plant. It is then returned to the same place in the river""”but in much better quality. The sewage reaching beyond the ""green line"" is diverted by a small dam that was built. This ""emergency solution"" will be integrated with the permanent solution in the future.

Riverbanks -- Approximately 18,000 cubic meters of earth were removed from the banks in order to reduce the slope from a steep incline at a ratio of approximately 1:2 to one of 1:5. The resulting moderate incline has enabled the growth of a lush bank vegetation, pedestrian paths and human access to the waterline at a number of points. At the point of the river's winding, a stone ""toe,"" largely hidden beneath the water, was fashioned in order to protect the bank from flood damage and erosion. Maximum attention was paid to drainage considerations when the channel was widened, and measures were taken to preserve the soil.

Dams and Fish Ladders  -- The concrete dam on the project's eastern extremity has been divided into four smaller dams, three of which are built out of natural stones. These dams were also built as ""fish ladders"" to ensure the passage of fish along the river. The dams are essential to maintaining the river's ecological continuity, creating unique ecosystems, ensuring water mixing and quality enhancement, and providing maximal water flow for visitor enjoyment.

Demonstration Project -- The Demonstration Project, launched in 1999, involved the restoration of a 750-meter section of the river and the creation of an extensive river park to accommodate leisure and recreation activities. The park is very accessible from the national road system and features pedestrian walking paths, lush vegetation, and a hanging steel bridge that spans the river. 

In order to begin work on the park, the incline of the banks along this stretch first had to be moderated.  Once a gentler slope had been created, approximately 35,000 seedlings and 350 trees were planted. All of the plants and trees were chosen according to their ecological and historic suitability to the region, as well as their preference for specific locations (i.e. adjacent to the water line, on the banks, or beyond them). The selection process favored vegetation with minimal water requirements in an attempt to reduce park maintenance and avoid the need for regular irrigation in a country that suffers from a severe scarcity of water. Preference was also given to plants that would help preserve the soil and stabilize the slopes.

The hanging bridge, unique in its kind in Israel, will, on the one hand, offer a sculptural element in the heart of the project and, on the other hand, a means to cross to the southern bank. It also provides the public with a unique setting from which to view the river.

As part of this project, three riffles were constructed along this section of the river in order to facilitate the passage of fish, oxygenate the water, and create a more aesthetic, riverine experience for visitors to the park.

River Parks -- Six other river parks have been constructed along sections of the river, in addition to the Demonstration Project. Riverbanks have been equipped with wheelchair-accessible pedestrian paths for hiking, jogging, and bike riding; and these paths trace a variety of circular and longitudinal routes along the most attractive sections of the river. In many places, terraced stones have been designed to allow for sitting and viewing the river. Parks are also equipped with high quality wooden garden furniture consisting of pergolas designed to provide shade, benches, picnic tables, garbage bins, etc. Signposts have been installed in many locations to provide directions, explain the objectives and components of the restoration project, and offer diagrams and photographs of the river prior to restoration. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Through various measures adopted under the auspices of this project, the main sources of pollution degrading the Alexander River have been addressed and mitigated via water treatment facilities. The curtailment of pollutants has yielded an increasing improvement in water quality and hope for revitalization of the river. 

With the principal cause of degradation (i.e. pollution) alleviated, ecosystem improvement measures have been implemented with much success. River parks have enhanced and beautified several sections of the river, and have helped garner much interest and enthusiasm about the project from the general public. Newly installed fish ladders and riffles have improved water quality and are attracting many water birds for the ecosystem benefits they afford.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: A new treatment plant for the city of Natanya (180,000 inhabitants) was built in 1996, and the city's sewage is now treated and used for irrigation, instead of flowing into the river. Most of the other major sources of pollution (industries, villages, etc.) were also connected to this plant and to the regional water system. Consequently, water quality has already improved significantly, and it is expected to continue improving in the years to come. 

Besides health-related improvements, the Alexander River project has also fostered a greater sense of community. The new park attracts thousands of visitors every weekend--from nearby villages but also from the larger surrounding area--and several community events have already been held there. One such event, held in July 2002, was the first ""River Festival."" Seven thousand people attended an open-air presentation of the project followed by a musical performance. Other activities have included a musical parade, tree planting events, and educational visits.

Arguably the most important contribution of this project has been made in the diplomatic arena. Two unique agreements have been signed by local Israeli and Palestinian officials in conjunction with the Alexander River Restoration Project. The first agreement, signed in 1996 by the Palestinian Governor of the District of Tul Karem and the Israeli head of the Emek Hefer Regional Council, was the first of its kind between the warring neighbors. This agreement was signed in Hebrew and in Arabic, and it has formed the basis for long-term cooperation on a local level between the Alexander River Restoration Administration (and the Emek Hefer Local Council) and the Governor of Tul Karem. Although circumstances have presented difficulties at various points throughout the project's implementation, the cooperation has never stopped, as both sides believe the issues of environment and health can heal the ecosystem and the future of both people. Thus, as the bitter conflict rages on in the Middle East, this project has the potential to serve as a bridge between the Israelis and Palestinians.
The Alexander River Restoration Project is the leading river restoration in Israel and continues to attract international attention. The project has garnered four national awards, among them the Henry Ford Conservation Award in Israel (1997) and the award for “Beautiful Israel”, which was received from the President of Israel in 2001. In Brisbane, Australia in 2003, the project was awarded one of the world’s most prestigious international prizes for excellence in river management, the Thiess International Riverprize.
The Alexander River Restoration Project is a source of real hope that in spite of the complicated situation in the Middle East, Israelis and Palestinians will succeed one day in tearing down the security walls that divide them, and have peace and normal cooperation on the real important issues of life — health, environment, water, leisure, education etc. They will heal the abused river together, as neighbors, and continue to cooperate for a better future in this part of the world. The ultimate success of the rehabilitation scheme will be dependent upon the success of sewage treatment measures. Netanya’s sewage treatment plant (inaugurated in 1996), along with plans for effluent treatment and disposal facilities in industrial plants in the Emek Hefer Region, should bring about the expected improvements.
Gardening, watering and cleaning of the parks and paths that have already been developed along the river must be done on a regular basis. The Administration hires a gardening contractor to coordinate and supervise these routine maintenance activities; and in 2003, a group of volunteers started a course during which they will be trained as “River Devotees” to provide assistance with some of these duties.
Almost every year, a major flood occurs, covering a large area of the floodplain. All the parks developed along the river are flooded, and all the sediments and waste must be removed and cleaned shortly after the flood. Preparedness for these floods has been incorporated into the management plan. "

The project, sponsored by the Idaho County Soil and Water Conservation District (ISWCD), began with an engineering component that reconnected historic meanders, constructed new meanders, reshaped channel cross sections, and installed a variety of bioengineered bank treatments. Once these hydrologic modifications were completed, practitioners revegetated the site with woody and herbaceous native riparian and wetland plant species. The revegetation component also incorporated erosion-control measures, such as seeding areas disturbed during construction with a mixture of grasses. It is hoped that, through this ecosystem approach, the project will restore the natural relationships between the river channel, floodplain, riparian corridor, wet meadow, and adjacent upland habitats, and that benefits will accrue not only to fish and aquatic organisms, but also to waterfowl, wetland- and riparian-dependent species, and upland wildlife.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Since the early part of the 20th century, human activities on various geographic scales have had an accumulative impact on the ecology of the Lower Red River Meadow. Construction of reservoirs and hydroelectric dams in the Snake and Columbia River systems downstream has inhibited the migration of anadromous fish species. On a watershed scale, logging, mining, and road-building practices have altered the hydrology, sediment delivery, and water quality characteristics of the Red River. On a local scale, the river channel has been straightened and native riparian vegetation eliminated due to dredge mining or in an attempt to reduce flooding and maximize grazing area throughout the meadow. The river/wet meadow ecosystem has responded in the following ways:
– The river’s length and sinuosity have decreased, resulting in an increase in the channel gradient and the water’s erosive power, and therefore, elevated levels of suspended sediment and fine sediment deposition.
– The channel bed has downcut, causing over-steepened, unstable streambanks and overwidened reaches.
– The groundwater table has lowered and the meadow floodplain inundates less frequently, reducing the ability of soil moisture conditions to sustain native riparian plant communities.
– The river maintains a reduced quantity and diversity of instream fish habitat (pools, riffles, overhanging banks, woody debris, spawning gravels).
– Summer water temperatures are elevated, providing suboptimal fish spawning and rearing conditions. Historically, the Red River supported relatively abundant numbers and diverse populations of anadromous and resident fish species, including: chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), steelhead/rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), and Westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki lewsi).
The Lower Red River Meadow is home to a number of game and non-game species. Elk (Cervus elaphus), moose (Alces alces), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) graze in the meadow and use the adjacent forested area as calving and fawning habitat. During the spring, as many as 200 elk and 40 cow and calf pairs can be seen in the meadow of the RRWMA. The wetter areas in the meadow attract
Canadian geese (Branta canadensis), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), wood ducks (Aix sponsa), and other waterfowl and shorebirds. Blue herons (Ardea herodias) sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis), and osprey (Pandion haliaetus) migrate through the area. Red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), and various songbirds have been sighted along the timbered edges and upland portions of the meadow.
Willows most likely comprised the major component of the original woody riparian community in the Lower Red River Meadow (Brunsfeld 1994), primarily Drummond willow (Salix drummondiana), Geyer willow (S. geyeriana), and Booth willow (S. boothii). Other woody species included Pacific willow (S. lasiandra), sandbar willow (S. exigua), red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera), thinleaf alder (Alnus incana), and bearberry honeysuckle (Lonicera involucrata). Many of the native herbaceous species existing today comprised the original associated understory including a variety of sedges (Carex spp.), rushes (Juncus spp.), bulrushes (Scirpus spp.), and grasses that thrive in moist to wet soils. 1. Restore natural river channel shape, meander pattern, and substrate conditions to enhance the quantity and quality of spawning and rearing habitat for chinook salmon, steelhead trout, bull trout, and other anadromous and resident fish species and aquatic organisms.
2. Restore native meadow and riparian plant communities to enhance fish and wildlife habitat, stabilize streambanks, and improve water quality.
3. Measure and document progress in satisfying short- and long-term project goals, objectives, and expected outcomes.
4. Promote public and agency awareness and scientific knowledge of watershed and river restoration principles and techniques.
5. Manage and communicate project activities to efficiently accomplish project goals.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Active restoration occurred in four phases (I-IV) and encompassed six years. Restoration activities included reconnecting historic meanders, constructing new meanders, reshaping channel cross sections, installing a variety of bioengineered bank treatments, and planting native riparian vegetation. The engineering and revegetation components of the project are intended to have a synergistic effect, whereby improved hydrologic conditions--i.e. higher surface water elevations and an increase in the frequency and duration of floodplain inundation--provide the soil moisture necessary for the establishment and sustainability of native riparian plant communities.

The river restoration design was based on a 1936 photograph of the meadow showing river meandering patterns, amplitudes, and frequency. The new meander pattern was designed as a complex and irregular succession of bends intended to reconnect historic channel sections and lengthen the stream channel. Cross-sectional shapes were designed using estimated characteristic stream flows, natural channel shapes, fish habitat criteria, and hydraulic geometry relationships. Channel cross-sectional shapes differ depending on the type of reach  -  straight, transition, or bend. Rock sills were used as grade control structures to raise ground and surface water elevations, reduce erosional forces, and provide soil moisture conditions suitable for native riparian vegetation. For each sill, approximately 20 boulders ranging from 36 inches (91 cm) in diameter were placed across the channel in an arc shape, with the apex of the arc positioned on the upstream side. Several boulders were anchored into each streambank.

Once reconstruction was completed, water was diverted into the new channel in a sequential manner by using temporary diversion structures. The diversion structures--water bladders and concrete highway barriers--were placed across the width of the existing channel to alter the stream course and divert live water into the new channel. Diverting water into the new channel section, dewatering the former channel section, and transferring fish from the former channel took place over several days. The following procedure was used in Phases I and II:
â™¦ A track excavator positions the water bladders or concrete highway barriers across the width of the upstream end of the channel section to be abandoned, slowly diverting water flow into new channel and blocking flow from former channel area.
â™¦ Geotextile sediment-control fabric is placed on upstream side of the diversion structures.
â™¦ The remaining water is allowed to freely flow out the downstream end of the channel to be abandoned; large fish leave the channel at this time.
â™¦ Residual water is pumped from the former channel onto the adjacent floodplain using a tractor-mounted pump equipped with fish screen on the intake hose.
â™¦ As the former channel was dewatered, a fisheries consultant or Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) staff supervised the electrofishing procedure to safely transfer remaining fish from the former channel to the new channel. Harm to fish was reduced by using the minimum required pulse rate and width and minimizing handling time.
â™¦ The downstream diversion structure is installed as fish are being transferred, preventing fish migration back into former channel.

Before temporary diversion structures were removed, reinforced banks were installed at the upstream end of the former channel, and the entire former channel was backfilled with soil and gravel excavated from new or historic channel sections. Reinforced banks consist of layers of rocks and logs with soil and gravel fill and are designed to prevent recapture of the old channel alignment. These structures extend the entire width of the former channel and are anchored into each bank. The reinforced bank was completely buried with backfill material, except near the water's edge. Where log ends meet the water's edge, localized lateral scour pools, beneficial as fish habitat, are expected to develop.

In order to ensure water quality, this engineering component of the restoration was designed in accordance with the following best management practices:
 -  All in-channel work, below the ordinary high water mark, was limited to a six week period--July 1st  -  August 15th--in order to minimize construction-related impacts to spawning, rearing, and migration of anadromous and resident fish.
 -  Excavation took place in dry channels, whenever feasible, by maintaining a soil plug between excavation activities and the live stream channel. Soil plugs were kept at the up- and downstream boundaries until new stream reaches were ready to be connected with the live channel.
 -  Turbid water was pumped through vegetated historic channels or wetland swales whenever feasible in order to filter fines before water traveled back to the live stream channel. Pumps were equipped with fish screens on intake hoses. Constructed pools in the new channel bends and enhanced pool areas in the historic bends were also used to settle sands.
 -  Stream channel crossings with heavy equipment were minimized, and when crossings occurred, they were located in shallow, straight reaches with gravel/cobble substrate and no previous history of redds.
 -  Equipment traffic during wet weather or within wet zones was minimized as an erosion control measure.
 -  Excavated material was stockpiled at a distance from the live stream channel and above the ordinary high water mark to reduce the risk of high-water inundation. All excavated material not used as backfill in the former channel was placed in upland areas.

Once the channel modifications were successfully completed, active revegetation of the site began. Species comprising the once prevalent native plant communities were hypothesized using on-site and adjacent land surveys, current published literature, historical data and photographs, and local accounts of historical conditions. Nearly 115,000 native riparian and wetland plants, including a variety of woody shrubs (willows, red osier dogwoods, serviceberry, thinleaf alder) and herbaceous seedlings (sedges, rushes, bulrushes), were planted throughout Phases I-IV. Due to low rainfall, typical during the summer months in the lower meadow, irrigation was supplied, where necessary, to ensure quick establishment and improve survival rates of newly sown seed and planted seedlings.

In general, planting locations were selected according to the hydrologic requirements and big game palatability of a particular species. For example, species requiring the highest amount of soil moisture, such as Drummond willow and sandbar willow, were placed closest to the water's edge. Drummond willow and red-osier dogwood, highly palatable to big game animals, were planted into the outside cut banks where access is difficult. Less palatable species, such as thinleaf alder, were used in the more game-accessible straight reaches.

Willow species were planted as dormant pole cuttings during the late spring and summer. Other woody shrubs were planted as seedling plugs. Since native sources were unavailable on-site, the willow pole cuttings were collected as close to the project site as possible. Seed sources for alder, dogwood, aspen, honeysuckle, serviceberry, and hawthorn were found on the project site, as well as up- and downstream. Willow pole cuttings were collected, prepared, and cooler-stored during February and March prior to each field season. Pole cuttings were removed from the cooler and soaked in water for three days at ambient outside temperatures to initiate bud and root growth just prior to spring/summer planting. Seeds of thinleaf alder, red-osier dogwood, serviceberry, and other native woody species were collected in the summer/fall, cleaned and prepared for storage during the winter, and then planted in a commercial greenhouse in late winter and early spring (February through May). Seedlings could then be planted in the fall or the following spring. Seedlings held over until the following spring were moved into a cooler during peak dormancy (January) and stored until ready to plant.

Pacific and Geyer willow poles, ranging 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 meters) in length, were placed within 20 feet (6.1 meters) of the water's edge on top of the bank or terraces. The terraces of outside bends were planted with a higher density planting (approximately 1.8 to 3 meters on center) compared to straight reaches or inside bends. A tree planting auger was used to drill 4 inch (10 cm) diameter holes as deep as possible to ensure the cuttings reach the mid-summer water table. An auger-resistant layer of river rock/gravel occurs at varying depths throughout the meadow. Holes drilled less than 32 inches (81 cm) deep, due to this impenetrable gravel layer, were abandoned and refilled. A single pole was placed in each hole and, if possible, pressed further into the ground. The holes were then backfilled with existing soil to achieve good soil-to-stem contact.

Drummond and sandbar willow poles, ranging from 4 to 8 feet (1.2 to 2.4 meters) in length, were placed at or near the water's edge. Depending on soil conditions, both Drummond and sandbar willow can either be inserted by hand or placed in a drilled hole. Drummond willow poles were pushed into the soil to reach the mid-summer water table, usually at a 45- degree angle to the vertical bank along outside bends. Drummond willow poles were planted in high densities, often exceeding 1 foot (30 cm) on center, to accelerate the development of stable streambanks, shade and cover, and reduced water temperatures. Sandbar willow poles were pushed into the soil at or below the waterline on the inside bend point bars. In areas where soil conditions precluded hand placement, a hole was drilled to a 2-foot (61-cm) depth, the pole cutting was placed, and the hole was then backfilled to achieve good soil-to-stem contact. Sandbar willow poles were planted in point bar areas to facilitate long-term sediment deposition and subsequent decrease in channel width.

Thinleaf alder seedlings were planted along straight reaches and red-osier dogwood were interspersed amongst the Drummond willow along the outside bend cut banks. Serviceberry seedlings were planted on the top of banks or terraces. Woody seedlings were planted using an auger with a 1.5-inch (3.8-cm) diameter earth bit or hand dibble. The seedling was placed into the hole and then backfilled, using care not to create airspace along the seedling plug and soil interface.

Seeds from herbaceous plant species--dagger-leaf rush, Coville's rush, Colorado rush, small-fruited bulrush, small-winged sedge, lens sedge, and beaked sedge--were collected on the project site in August and September. Seedlings were grown in a commercial greenhouse in 10 cubic inch (164 cubic cm) containers the following spring and early summer and delivered to the meadow for planting in August and September.

Herbaceous plants were also placed according to their specific hydrologic and other known habitat requirements. Dagger-leaf rush, Coville's rush, and small-fruited bulrush were planted at or near the water's edge. Colorado rush and small-winged sedge were planted in dryer sites on top of the banks or terraces. Lens and beaked sedge were planted into the slumped areas of cut banks and in off-channel water-holding depressions.

The majority of seedlings were planted with a 1.5-inch (3.8-cm) diameter, gas-powered auger/drill; a small percentage was planted with a hand dibble. The herbaceous seedlings were planted in varying densities. The design specifications set the spacing of herbaceous seedlings on approximately 4-foot (1.2-meter) centers, interspersed amongst the woody shrub species. In areas disturbed by construction and more susceptible to erosional forces, such as exposed vertical banks, herbaceous plant densities were increased.

Finally, an erosion-control seed mix was sown in newly exposed soil disturbed by construction activities, such as reinforced banks, former channel areas, and access roads. Prior to seeding, a finish-sized D4 bulldozer performed the final grading in construction areas and obliterated temporary access roads. A four or six-wheeled ATV with harrow attachment followed the final grading to prepare a smooth seed bed. Using a spreader mounted on the ATV, the erosion control seed mix was broadcast over the disturbed areas. The seed mixture was comprised of the following five species and percentages: Sheep fescue (Festuca ovina) 30%; Bromar mountain brome (Bromus carinatus) 30%; Sherman big bluegrass (Poa sandbergii) 15%; Canada Bluegrass (Poa compressa) 15%; and White dutch clover (Trifolium repens) 10%. All of these species were mixed with ReGreen, a sterile wheatgrass/wheat hybrid that establishes quickly, providing first year erosion control, before dying out and allowing the native species to establish.

The planted seed was subjected to a second harrowing to ensure good contact with the soil surface. A coconut fiber (coir) erosion control fabric was placed and stapled to the leading 50- foot (15-meter) edge of the reinforced bank areas (upstream ends of former channel). These areas were then re-seeded with the erosion control seed mixture. A general purpose fertilizer (16-16-16) was applied with a hand spreader over all planted areas.

Eleven wildlife exclosures were installed to aid the study of ungulate browsing impacts on plant survival and provide important information for developing adaptive management strategies. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Phase I (1996) and Phase II (1997) engineering accomplishments included reconnecting two historic channel meanders (Goose Island Bend and Historic S-Curve Loops), constructing two new meanders (Big Bend and Giant Bend), and accentuating three existing outside bends(Two-Sill Bend, Hopeful Bend, and Ninety- Degree Bend). Due to these changes in channel alignment, the channel length on the entire RRWMA increased by 3,060 feet (933 meters), channel gradient decreased by 25 percent, and sinuosity increased from 1.7 to 2.3. Channel cross-sectional shapes and point bars were modified or created to maintain deep pool habitat during low flows, convey average annual flows within the channel, and dissipate flood flows onto the floodplain. Six rock grade control structures were installed to raise low flow surface water and groundwater elevations. A pond/wetland area, approximately 200 feet by 125 feet (61 meters by 38 meters) was constructed in Phase II to provide additional shallow and open water habitat for waterfowl and other wetland dependent species. Several log habitat structures were keyed into the outside streambanks of Big Bend and Hopeful Barb Bend. As the channel stabilizes with time, reduced stream bank and bed erosion rates and improved water quality are expected. Increases in both surface water and groundwater elevations will enhance soil moisture conditions and reconnect tributary mouths, backwater channels, and other off-channel rearing habitat to the main channel.

The following is a summary of findings from a series of post-restoration monitoring activities:
 -  Sinuosity and Slope:
Restoration activities increased channel length by 1.54 km or 60%, resulting in a 60% increase in sinuosity from 1.7 in 1994 to 2.7 in 2000. Slope decreased by 40% from 0.0025 in 1994 to 0.0015 in 2000. Channel alignment, sinuosity, and slope are now similar to 1936 historic conditions. 
 -  Velocity and Water Surface Elevations (WSE):
Compared to pre-restoration conditions (1994), median bankfull water velocity was significantly slower immediately following restoration (2000), but not 3 years later in 2003. No significant changes occurred in median low-flow velocity. For both bankfull and low flow, median distances between the water surface and tops of high and low banks decreased significantly when comparing pre-restoration (1994) to both immediately (2000) and 3 years post-restoration (2003). Significantly shorter distances were also found in 2003 compared to 2000.
 -  Groundwater Depth:
Mean groundwater depth for the growing season ranged from 0.75 m during 1998 to 1.08 m during 2000. After adjusting for month of observation and linear influence of discharge, no significant temporal trend in depth to groundwater was detected.
 -  Hydroperiod and Floodplain Inundation:
Modeling simulations illustrated an average increase in post-restoration hydroperiod by more than 25 days of 200%. Based on modeling at bankfull discharge, areal extent of post-restoration floodplain inundation increased by nearly 150% and volume of water stored on the floodplain increased by nearly 200%.
 -  Riparian Transect Composition:
Mean native plant cover in the phase I riparian transects increased significantly from 32% in 1997 to 57% in 2001, reaching 65% in 2003. Mean native cover in phase II decreased from 74 to 52% between 1998 and 2001 and then exhibited a nonsignificant increase to 63% in 2003. Phases III and IV experienced decreases in native cover between 2001 and 2003, from 69 to 51% and from 83 to 77%, respectively.
 -  Greenline Transect Composition:
Mean native greenline plant cover in phase I decreased from 49 to 43% between 1997 and 2001 and then exhibited a nonsignificant increase to 64% in 2003. Native cover in phase II experienced consecutive decreases from 73 to 53 to 49% between 1998, 2001, and 2003. The native cover of phase IV decreased from 88 to 68% between 2001 and 2003, whereas that of phase III remained unchanged at 58%.
 -  Fish Habitat Diversity:
The total number of habitat units increased by 52%, from 48 to 73, between 1994 and 2001. The count remained at 73 in 2002 and then increased to 102 in 2003. Although the number of habitat types fluctuated during the four survey years, by 2003, the number of pools increased by 300%, riffles increased by 24%, and runs/glides increased significantly by nearly 150% compared to pre-restoration (1994) conditions. Area occupied by each habitat type also fluctuated between survey years. However, in each post-restoration survey, deepwater habitats (pool + run/glide) occupied between 36 and 54% more area compared to pre-restoration, whereas shallow habitat (riffle) occupied 51-78% less. The overall increase in area and percent composition of deepwater habitat was not statistically significant. 
 -  Salmonid Density:
Salmonid denisities fluctuated among the five survey years, ranging from 7.1 fish/100 m2 in 2003 to 27.8 fish/100 m2 in 2001. Although salmonid densities were greater than non-salmonids each year, no significant increasing trend in salmonid density or percent composition was detected in the restored reach. When considered separately, nonrestored (control) transects also exhibited no significant increases in salmonid density. When drainage-level data were combined, a significant increasing trend in salmonid density was detected. But no significant differences were found in linear trends of salmonid densities between locations, including comparisons to the restored reach.
 -  Redd Counts:
Annual Chinook redd density in the restored site also fluctuated, ranging from 0.0/km in 1994 to 17.7/km in 1997. No significant increase in redd density was detected. Similar annual variability occurred in non-restored (control) reaches of the drainage, and no significant differences were detected when compared to the restored site.
 -  Bird Populations and Diversity:
Although fluctuations occurred between 1996 and 2003, bird numbers increased significantly from 52 in 1996 (pre-restoration) to 91 in 2003 (3 years post-restoration), with the highest value (128) reported in 2001. Spearman's correlation coefficient detected a significant positive relationship between the number of bird species and years. Shannon's index of species diversity increased significantly for the same time period. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: From 2002 through 2004, additional plantings were installed and a variety of plant protection strategies were implemented in response to monitoring results that indicated woody riparian plantings were exhibiting slow growth rates and reduced vigor and performing below expectations. This poor performance is attributed to ungulate browsing and rodent damage, vegetative competition, local soil moisture conditions, and the short growing season. Plant protection and growth enhancement strategies included browse control, weed control, tree tubes, fencing, and fertilizer applications.

Although aquatic habitat structure has improved, no significant positive trends with time in salmonid densities or chinook redd densities were detected in the project reach. Off-site conditions beyond the project's control and natural and human-induced fluctuations in both anadromous and resident fish populations affect the number of adult spawners in any given year and complicate analyses. Three years post-restoration is also early in the recovery process relative to expectations for positive changes in fish populations and chinook redd densities.

Bird numbers and species are increasing on the project site while overall terrestrial wildlife habitat has yet to exhibit improvements. Summer water temperatures are increasing. The native riparian shrubs, actively planted throughout the project site, continue to exhibit slow growth rates and reduced vigor, providing only a small percentage of cover in the riparian and greenline plant composition transects. Thus, a shading effect is currently unavailable to help reduce water temperatures, and in turn, to improve the thermal conditions of aquatic habitat. Until a woody riparian corridor, capable of intercepting solar radiation, is sufficiently established on both the restoration site and upstream, overall water temperature decreases, additional significant improvements to aquatic habitat, and significant increases in terrestrial wildlife habitat value appear unlikely.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: In 1997, the project team identified a number of education and public outreach activities having the potential to disseminate knowledge and experiences gained from the Lower Red River Meadow Restoration Project. Through these activities and in coordination with IDFG, the project teams hopes to encourage the use of the RRWMA and the restoration project for indoor and outdoor classroom activities. In addition, public outreach activities are necessary to promote the use of the project area as a model or demonstration site for similar projects in the region.
Although the full recovery of the site is expected to take several decades, the physical features of the channel are meeting or evolving toward the performance criteria, and are thus moving in the direction of expected habitat improvements. However, until a woody riparian corridor, capable of intercepting solar radiation, is sufficiently established on both the restoration site and upstream, overall water temperature decreases, streambank stabilization, additional significant improvements to aquatic habitat, and significant increases in terrestrial wildlife habitat value appear unlikely. The establishment of healthy riparian vegetation will depend on a continued commitment to monitor the hydrologic changes, evaluate the recently implemented vegetation protection strategies, and maintain and expand the use of those strategies that prove most effective. A mature and dense woody riparian corridor is key to the overall success of this restoration project. Significant recovery of the riparian corridor, however, will depend on the following:
– Additional tree tubes, weed control mats, and fencing.
– Ongoing maintenance of plant protection structures.
– Replanting/fencing in critical streambank areas, concentrating on the west and south streambanks where dense, woody shrubs and trees can be most effective intercepting the solar radiation of the warm, afternoon sun.
– Routine browse control, fertilizer, and irrigation, as necessary, until plants are well-established and self-sustaining.
– Expanding the riparian corridor plantings to the upstream property.
– Experimentation with other strategies such as clump plantings of mature willows.
– Commitment to evaluate the success of the vegetation protection strategies and to maintain and expand the use of those strategies that prove most effective.
– Continuation of the effectiveness monitoring and an adaptive management program to ensure the ecosystem maintains its path to recovery by confirming habitat improvements, isolating restoration effects for those features slower to respond, and identifying short-term maintenance needs. "

Encompassing 100 acres of tallgrass prairie that had been converted into agricultural land and 60 acres of woodland fringing a creek, the monument underwent restoration by the National Park Service in 1939 in an attempt to restore the prairie that Freeman would have discovered upon his arrival at the site. Ongoing for more than 60 years, the Homestead restoration is the nation’s second oldest tallgrass prairie restoration project behind Curtis Prairie at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum. Recently reported findings from National Park Service monitoring activities have shown that the restored Homestead Prairie exhibits the species diversity and distribution characteristic of a functioning native prairie.Agriculture & Livestock When the monument was established by Congress in 1936, the upland slopes of the site were severely eroded, the lower slopes were covered with heavy depositions of silt, and the woodlands were cut over and heavily grazed. At least 40 acres of the site were under cultivation as late as November 1939. To restore the landscape to tallgrass prairie in order to reduce soil erosion and approximate the original conditions of the site when it was first settled in 1863.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: The following is a timeline of major restoration activities: 1939- Park records indicate that the first seeding took place in 1939 with seed gathered from a prairie located approximately 5 miles to the west. The approximate seed mixture was 45% big bluestem, 50% little bluestem, and 1% each of Kentucky bluegrass, needleandthread, indiangrass, prairie dropseed and sideoats grama. This original restoration also included the installation of native plant plugs and the transplantation of sod from local areas of unploughed prairie in an attempt to control severe sheet, rill, and gully erosion on the coarse-textured south upland slopes. The source of the sod is unknown.
1942- Additional seeding and sodding, along with the construction of small check dams to slow erosion. 
1943-Weed control; sunflowers were mowed and bindweed was treated with sodium chlorate. 
1947- Sodding in upland gullies; seeding and local prairie hay mulch used in eroding areas. 
1948- Additional spot seeding; sod added to the uplands; selective grazing suggested as a means of reducing fire hazard. 
1949- First use of herbicide other than sodium chlorate (2,4-D). 
1951- 40 acres mowed. 
1952- Upland hayed. 
1953- Bottomland hayed. 
1954- Seeds harvested 
1955- Smooth bromegrass infestation noted. 
1963- 2,4-D used for weed control. 
1964- Lowlands heavily infested with weeds. Dalapon used for smooth brome control and 2,4-D for broadleaf weeds. 
1965- Thatch buildup leads to complete mowing. 
1968- Smooth brome mowed. 
1969- 7-11 acres of lowland seeded. 
1970- First prescribed burn to manage the prairie; 2,4-D applied.

Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Today, the species composition of the tallgrass prairie at Homestead resembles that of presettlement times. In fact, plant diversity is greater in the oldest sections of the restored prairie than in some native prairie remnants in the area. There are 116 species of plants present at the site, and dominant species include: big bluestem, little bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass, goldenrod, field pussytoes, and leadplant. Interspersed within the prairie are thickets of shrubby species such as sumac, wild plum, and dogwood, which provide habitat for birds and other small animals. (see attached lists of bird and mammal species)

A report produced by the National Park Service in 2007 presented the findings of sampling exercises conducted at monitoring sites between 1998 and 2006. Based on the data collected at these sites, it is concluded that the 100 acres of restored prairie at Homestead National Monument reflect the species richness and diversity of the prairie's historic source and native species augmentation. It is a species-rich plant community with a distribution pattern composed of core and satellite species (Hanski 1982). There are a few abundant (core) species that give the prairie its unique and enduring characteristics--i.e. summer/fall forbs and warm-season grasses such as big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash)--and numerous (satellite) species occurring either in low abundance or patchily distributed (Grubb 1986). The high degree of species composition similarity between sites and sample years (evenness), along with only 47% of annual species represented within each site on average, illustrates this core-satellite community structure in the prairie. Although it is difficult to make a quantitative comparison of the restored prairie with a mid-1860s prairie, the core-satellite distribution of species reflects a functioning native prairie.
The park monitors for nonnative species in the prairie and woodland areas of the monument and uses a combination of techniques, including mowing, selective use of herbicides, and prescribed fire, to manage these areas.
Prescribed burning began in 1970. The prairie is divided into six management units and burned on a seven-year cycle. Every year, two units are randomly chosen for treatment, with the stipulation that once a unit has been burned twice in the seven-year period, it is removed from consideration for the duration of that period. Seasonality of fires is also randomized. The seventh year is a “rest year.” The goals of the fire management program are control of exotic species such as smooth brome, management of shrub species to no more than 15% of the prairie by area, and removal of plant debris that, if left in place, creates the potential for a large, devastating fire.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-wisconsin-curtis-prairie-restoration/	USA: Wisconsin: Curtis Prairie Restoration	United States of America	2007-08-15	2007-08-15	"Curtis Prairie at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum is the site of the world’s first ecological restoration project. Begun in 1936 by Dr. Theodore Sperry, with supervision and support from Aldo Leopold and William Longenecker, the project has been ongoing for more than seventy years and has yielded a wealth of research data about the dynamics of tallgrass prairie ecosystems and the practices most effective in their restoration and management. Indeed, investigations conducted at the Curtis Prairie site have assisted practitioners elsewhere in designing and implementing tallgrass prairie restorations. Throughout its history, the Curtis Prairie project has been an asset not only for the academic community at the University of Wisconsin, but for the entire field of restoration ecology.Agriculture & Livestock The tallgrass prairie ecosystem is one of the most threatened ecosystems in the Midwest United States (Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources 1995). The relatively flat topography and fertile prairie soils encouraged the conversion of prairie for agricultural purposes. The 25-hectare area that would become Curtis Prairie was first settled for farming in 1836. After eleven owners, the Bartlett family purchased the land in 1860. By 1863 the western two-thirds of the land was regularly plowed and planted with corn, oats and pasture in rotation. The wetter eastern third was probably not plowed, with the northern section undisturbed and the southern half used for a mowing meadow. The Bartlett family abandoned cultivation in 1920. The land was fallow until 1926 or 1927 when a veterinarian named West leased the land to pasture 35 to 40 horses. This pasture incorporated the eastern third of the property, including the previously undisturbed section and the mowing meadow (Blewett & Cottam 1984).
By 1932 the University of Wisconsin Arboretum was becoming a reality. In that year, a part of the Nelson farm was purchased, and in 1933, the University of Wisconsin regents purchased the Bartlett farm. When the fields were purchased, quackgrass (Agropyron repens) dominated the fields. Eventually, two bluegrass species (Poa pratensis and P. compressa) took over (Blewett & Cottam 1984). All three species are considered weedy and non-native components of tallgrass prairies. The creation of a prairie within the Arboretum proved challenging. Not only was this the first ecological restoration, there was also very little tallgrass prairie habitat left to characterize reference conditions. In fact, in The Vegetation of Wisconsin, John Curtis (1959) estimates that the original area of over 800,000 hectares has been reduced to remnants, with none larger than 16 hectares. Although grasses comprise only 10% of the species, they constitute most of the biomass in tallgrass prairies. The dominant grasses vary across a moisture gradient ranging from xeric (dry), mesic (moist), and wet prairies. Common grasses include little blue stem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans). Forbs, another important prairie component, align themselves along a similar moisture gradient. These herbaceous species add seasonal color and texture to prairie vegetation. Besides grasses, the most common plant families in tallgrass prairies include composites and legumes (Cochrane & Iltis 2000). The restoration goal was to replace pasture and ruderal vegetation with species of native plants for use in research and education. Over the decades that followed the dedication of the Arboretum in 1934, scientists from the University of Wisconsin conducted many experiments involving planting methods and controlled burning. These experiments were aimed at increasing the number of native plant species and decreasing the abundance of weedy and exotic plant species.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Since its inception in 1936, the Curtis Prairie restoration project has provided innumerable opportunities for scientific research on tallgrass prairie restoration and has afforded a more complete understanding of tallgrass prairie ecosystems in general. Many students and faculty members from the University of Wisconsin-Madison have been involved in the ongoing management of the site, and its value as an educational tool has therefore been tremendous.

Description of Project Activities: From 1936 to 1940, Dr. Theodore Sperry directed the first effort to establish a prairie with supervision from Aldo Leopold and William Longenecker. About 200 recruits of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) planted 42 plant species in large blocks within 237 plantings. Three methods of planting were tested: seeds, seedlings and sod transplants. This approach likely represents the first example of experimentation in a restoration site. Prairie remnants along the Wisconsin River provided a source of native seeds and sods, and the seedlings were cultivated in a nursery within the prairie. The establishment rates for the planting treatments were similar, but the sod transplants had slightly higher survival; however, the expense of the sod techniques far outweighed the benefits (Blewett & Cottam 1984).

Between 1950 and 1957, a second major planting program added 156 species to selected areas of Curtis Prairie. New planting methods were utilized: seed casting after a burn, hand insertion of large seeds, transplanting sods, and disking followed by seed casting with the addition of cover crops. The last method provided the best results (Blewett & Cottam 1984; Wilson 1964).

Curtis Prairie also supported experiments on soil preparation, plant competition, controlled fire treatments, and germination studies. John T. Curtis, Professor of Botany at the University of Wisconsin, carried out many of these important studies. Between 1937 and 1948, 91 species were collected from prairie remnants in southern and western Wisconsin for germination experiments. Most prairie grass and forb seeds were shown to depend on stratification (overwintering or cold treatment) for germination (Green & Curtis 1950).

Between 1941 and 1946, John Curtis and Max Partch studied the effects of fire on the competition between bluegrass (Poa spp., from the former pasture) and prairie plants. They applied controlled fire treatments to plots burned in March, May or October on an annual or biennial schedule. Bare ground, prairie perennials and weedy forbs greatly increased in the burned 7.6m x 67m plots, but after six years, the bluegrass was reduced to one-fifth its original area in the burned plots (Blewett & Cottam 1984).

When Curtis became the Arboretum Research Coordinator, he scheduled prairie burns with a frequency of about every three years and every other year in some areas (Blewett & Cottam 1984). This burn frequency was increased by Virginia Kline (1986), in light of her research on the response of the invasive biennial sweet clover (Melilotus alba) to consecutive burns. Because the growth and reproduction of sweet clover occurs within two years, portions of the prairie with burns over two consecutive years greatly reduced the population of sweet clover. Thus, experimentation has characterized attempts to increase the ratio of native prairie plants to invasive species throughout Curtis Prairie's history as a restoration site. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: As the first ecological restoration project, work at Curtis Prairie began when little was known about the ecology of prairies in Wisconsin. The site has always been valuable for research, and plant composition continues to be assessed at about five-year intervals. The question remains as to how much Curtis Prairie resembles a native tallgrass prairie. An early comparison of Curtis Prairie and native prairie remnants showed that the vegetation and community structure were similar with the exception of far more non-prairie species in Curtis Prairie (Cottam & Wilson 1966). Also, a University of Wisconsin Soil Scientist, Francis Hole, found that the site was beginning to recover prairie soil characteristics. Whereas 90 years of agricultural use likely oxidized 50,000 kg of organic carbon per hectare, about 60% was regained between 1940 and 1959. While the soils of Curtis prairie are beginning to recover their former structure, prairie soil horizons form over long periods of time, developing in 500 to 4,000 years (Anderson 1972).

Plant community structure and soil formation are indicators of restoration progress but not necessarily of the site's ability to support native wildlife. Native fauna in Curtis prairie includes deer and coyote. Bison and elk, along with larger carnivores, are absent and clearly never will be present because the site is too small to support them. Small mammals and arthropods are limited to generalist species. The status of the fungal and bacterial communities of the soil is largely unknown. Mound building ants are the major soil cultivators of tall grass prairie, but ant mounds are only present in the unplowed area in the eastern section of Curtis Prairie (Howell & Kline 1987). Likewise, many of the grassland bird species that are declining in grasslands region wide are missing including bobolinks and Henslow's sparrows (Mossman 1984). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Fire was an important factor limiting the initial success of the Curtis Prairie's restoration. Though the prevalence of fire in tallgrass prairies in historic times was well documented, its role in the ecology of prairies was not clearly understood. Restoration efforts at the Arboretum began without employing fire, and the results were highly unsatisfactory. Reintroduced prairie natives flourished, but so did a host of weedy, non-prairie species, which prevented the natives from closing together to create a real prairie. Research carried out on the Arboretum prairies soon established the critical role of fire in the ecology of the tallgrass prairies of the upper Midwest.

The development that has occurred subsequent to the original replanting efforts has given rise to other challenges and limiting factors. As the city of Madison grew up around the Arboretum, highway 12-18 (also known as the ""beltline"") to the south of Curtis Prairie was widened in 1956, causing a substantial loss of the buffer of planted pine trees. Also, the roadwork caused erosion as well as deposition of sediments that buried some of the prairie (Blewett & Cottam 1984). Additional roadwork in 1959 and increasing runoff from urban development to the south perpetuated the problems of urban runoff. By 1969, a siltation pond had been added near the southern edge of the prairie to collect flows from a culvert that conveys urban runoff under highway 12-18. Because Curtis prairie slopes gently from southwest to northeast, water flowing out of the pond gradually eroded a creek that now dissects Curtis Prairie, providing opportunity for the extremely aggressive reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) to establish along the creek's floodplain.

A north-south road historically used as a fire lane impounded runoff and allowed a stand of willows (Salix exigua) to establish along with reed canary grass in the wettest areas. Recently, an ""Arizona crossing"" was installed to allow flow over the road, but the willows remain and have not significantly decreased despite management burning.

Finally, the pine trees that were planted as a buffer along the highway have grown tall, shading the prairie's southern edge while functioning less as a noise and visual block to an increasingly busy traffic route. The degradation of the southern edge of the prairie was increased by the disposal of dredge spoils from the detention pond, which were placed in a linear mound that is now dominated by reed canary grass.
Throughout its 68-year history, experimentation and management of Curtis Prairie has significantly increased our understanding of restoration ecology. Current prairie planting techniques and burn schedules have benefited greatly from the early experiments conducted on Curtis Prairie. This restoration also highlights the influence of the surrounding landscape on processes at the restoration site. In this case, the altered hydrology due to urbanization within the watershed requires continuous monitoring and management of the prairie. While Curtis prairie may be the oldest prairie restoration in the world, it is clearly still a work in progress. Nonetheless, it has provided valuable lessons that help guide tallgrass prairie restoration:
1. Weed removal during site preparation – to this day the weed species like sweet clover that were on the former agricultural site continue to persist. Elimination of invasive weeds during site preparation appears to be critical to success in the long run.
2. Planting diversity – Unless a project is surrounded by a quality natural area (the Curtis Prairie is surrounded by an suburban environment), the only species you will find years later, are the ones you planted. Therefore, it is important to plant as much diversity as is available and that you can afford at the time. Adding diversity years later, has not been shown to be successful.
3. Vegetation management – the Curtis Prairie is as successful as it is, because of continued maintenace. Management of existing weeds through pulling, cutting, spraying and burning have provided opportunities for learning, as well as one of the most successful prairie plantings done so far. Roadside plantings will need spot treatments to ward off noxious weeds. At present, most of the management decisions being made for Curtis Prairie concern fire regimes and the use of herbicide to control invasive species. The current fire management regime burns each part of the prairie two out of three years on average. This pattern of burns controls the outbreaks of sweet clover with only an occasional need to weed this species by hand. Frequent burns not only control invasive species but also curtail the encroachment of woody species into the prairie.
The problems associated with the urban development around Curtis Prairie, such as reed canary grass, continue to challenge restoration ecologists. These types of management issues at Curtis Prairie illustrate the need for adaptive management. Currently, the management decision-making process includes the Arboretum Ecologist, who devises the management plan, and the Land Care Manager, who supervises the implementation of the plan. The Arboretum Ecologist and the Land Care Manager receive feedback from researchers on a monthly basis via a “Research Coordination Group”. The Arboretum Ecologist and Land Care Manager report to the Arboretum Director who is supervised by the Dean of the Graduate School. While this system allows for both structure and flexibility, it does not fulfill the need for adaptive management. "

Researchers are working together with local villagers to transplant nursery-reared seedlings into a stand of severely degraded seasonally dry tropical forest and to conduct investigations aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of forest restoration techniques. FORRU’s unique approach, called the framework species method, involves the selection of 20-30 tree species that grow quickly, exhibit high rates of survival, produce dense canopies to shade out weeds, and yield fruits and flowers attractive to seed-dispersing fauna that carry seeds of other forest species onto the site. By planting these framework species, researchers have shown that the process of natural regeneration can be greatly accelerated and the likelihood of the restoration’s ultimate success can be considerably improved.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation The site targeted by this project had been covered with evergreen forest and had been cleared approximately 30 years previously in order to provide land for the cultivation of cabbages, corn, potatoes and other cash crops. Cultivation of most of the site was gradually phased out from 1996, although a small part of the site had remained cultivated for corn until 2004. Fires had also affected parts of the site in 1998 and 2003.
The abandoned fields were dominated by herbaceous weeds such as Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn (Dennstaedtiaceae), Bidens pilosa L. var. minor (Bl.) Sherf, Ageratum conyzoides L., Eupatorium odoratum L. and E. adenophorum Spreng. (all Compositae), Commelina diffusa Burm. F. (Commelinaceae) and grasses e.g. Phragmites vallatoria (Pluk, ex L.) Veldk., Imperata cylindrica (L.) P. Beauv. Var. major (Nees) C.E. Hubb. Ex Hubb. & Vaugh. and Thysanolaena latifolia (Roxb. ex Horn.) Honda (both Gramineae). Most of the slopes below the plots are still cultivated for corn, carrots and some upland rice, with lynchee orchards beyond, providing the villagers with their main source of income.
A few remnant trees remained sparsely scattered across the plot, but had not fostered substantial natural regeneration. The nearest patch of forest was about 4 km east from the plot. In general, soils in the deforested zone, analyzed in 2000 (Elliott et al., 2000), were significantly more acidic and contained significantly less organic matter and nitrogen, more sand and less silt and clay, when compared with undisturbed forest.
Generally speaking, tropical forest destruction represents a major threat to the seasonally dry forest of Southeast Asia’s highlands. The loss of this forest precipitates other detrimental impacts such as the degradation of water catchments, the loss of biodiversity and the worsening of rural poverty. The seasonally dry tropical forests of Southeast Asia’s monsoonal belt are thought to be more endangered than equatorial rainforests.
In response to this growing threat, several countries in the region have banned or restricted commercial logging in remaining areas of primary forest and have added former logging concessions to their already extensive systems of protected areas. In spite of these measures, the problem now is that even these so-called “protected” forests are often too degraded to meet the need for healthy, natural forest that is capable of supporting viable populations of wildlife. It is becoming increasingly apparent that attempts to protect remaining forest are not enough; destruction must not merely be halted, but actually reversed, if there is any hope of saving Southeast Asia’s tropical forests. The major forest types represented in Doi Suthep-Pui National Park include the deciduous forest associations of the lowlands (deciduous dipterocarp-oak, bamboo deciduous forest and mixed evergreen deciduous forest) and the evergreen forest of the uplands (sensu Maxwell & Elliott, 2001). The study area supports at least 493 of the 645 total tree species recorded in the park. There are two primary aims of this project. The first is to conduct research in order to develop ecologically sound and socially acceptable methods for accelerating the regeneration of natural forest ecosystems on degraded land within protected areas of Northern Thailand. The second aim is to undertake education programmes, based on knowledge generated from the research, to enable local people to improve forest restoration projects for biodiversity conservation, environmental protection and enhancement of human well being.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Demand for the information generated by The Forest Restoration Research Unit (FORRU) has become overwhelming. Researchers and project participants are disseminating key findings and management practices to a wide range of groups/individuals involved in forest restoration through a complementary project, “Education and Training for Restoring Tropical Forest Biodiversity in Thailand,” funded by Britain’s Darwin Initiative. This program is helping to build local capacity for accelerating natural regeneration and is providing new skills to improve forest restoration techniques and biodiversity monitoring practices. In fact, one of the project’s major outputs will be the publication of a definitive manual, detailing the best techniques to restore forest ecosystems for biodiversity conservation.

Description of Project Activities: The FORRU's research program has concentrated on four main areas:

i) development of criteria by which framework tree species are selected
ii) improved techniques to grow framework tree species in nurseries
iii) improved techniques to maximize performance of trees after planting 
iv) monitoring the return of biodiversity in planted plots

The essential ecological characteristics of framework tree species are: high survival when planted out in degraded sites; rapid growth; dense, spreading crowns that shade out herbaceous weeds; and flowering and fruiting (or provision of other resources) attractive to wildlife at a young age. In the seasonally dry tropics, where wild fires are an annual hazard during the dry season, an additional desirable characteristic of framework species is resilience to burning. When fire prevention measures fail, the success of forest restoration plantings can depend on the ability of the planted trees to re-sprout from their rootstock after fire has burnt their above-ground parts (i.e. coppicing). The essential nursery characteristics of framework species include; reliable seed availability; rapid and synchronous seed germination; and production of healthy seedlings in containers, preferably to a plantable size (40-60 cm) in less than 1 year. High quality seedlings are important, as they have the best chance of surviving in hostile deforested environments. Consequently it is essential that good horticultural practices are adopted.

For the purpose of this project, a research nursery was established at the National Park headquarters and a community tree nursery was built at the Hmong hill-tribe village of Mae Sa Mai, in collaboration with the village's grass roots conservation group. Experimental field plots were also planted near the village.

In the nursery, experiments were designed to develop horticultural practices that optimize seedling vigor and health (Blakesley et al., 2000). Germination trials were carried out on more than 400 native forest tree species (Blakesley et al., 2002). Some species germinated easily, whilst others proved difficult, and thus, various treatments to break dormancy were tested (Kopachon, 1995; Singpetch, 2001). For those species that proved impossible to germinate, vegetative propagation from cuttings and the rearing of seedlings dug up from the forest (Kuarak, 2002) were also investigated. Experiments were then conducted to determine the best container types and media for seedling growth and survival (Zangkum, 1998; Jitlam, 2001) and to develop production schedules for promising tree species (Kuarak et al., 2000; Elliott et al., 2002; Blakesley et al., 2000). The aim was to develop treatment combinations to produce trees of a plantable size and quality by the first or second planting season after seed collection.

Trees were then planted in field trials to assess the relative performance of various ""potential"" framework species (Elliott et al., in press). Survival and growth were monitored, as well as ability to shade out weeds and resilience to fire. Various silvicultural treatments, to enhance performance of the planted trees, were also tested. These included different weeding methods, mulching and fertilizer application regimes (Elliott et al., 2000). An essential characteristic of framework tree species is attractiveness to seed-dispersing wildlife. Therefore, planted trees were checked regularly for production of any resources that might attract birds or mammals (e.g. fruits, flowers etc.). Surveys to assess the species richness and composition of the ground flora and bird (Chantong, 1999) and mammal communities were also carried out.

Candidate framework species were initially selected from amongst a local tree flora of more than 600 species by consulting CMU's existing Herbarium database, nursery research on seedling and by pilot planting trials in 1995-1997. From 1998, experimental plots have been established annually in partnership with a Hmong hill-tribe community resident within DSPNP. FORRU helped the villagers to establish their own community tree nursery and to test the practicability of the new nursery methods developed in the research nursery in a village environment. The planting trials had three main objectives: i) to provide a quantitative assessment of the degree to which various tree species meet framework species criteria; ii) to test various silvicultural treatments to maximize field performance and iii) to monitor biodiversity recovery. As the more successful species and techniques have been adopted and less successful rejected, the success of these experimental plots has gradually improved. 

Using the findings from these investigations of potential framework species, FORRU conducted a planting of 4,010 tree saplings over approximately 3.2 hectares in August 2006. The planted saplings represent 46 species of proven value as framework species, plus a few species--e.g. Acer laurinum, Carallia brachiata, Podocarpus neriifolius, etc.--planted for conservation purposes, as they are considered to be rare or threatened with extirpation from the national park. Some of the trees had been grown from locally collected seed by the villagers themselves in their community tree nursery, while the rest were transported to the site from FORRU's research nursery at the HQ of the National Park. Trees had been grown for 6-18 months (depending on species) in 9 x 2 Â½ inch plastic bags in a medium of forest soil: coconut husk: peanut husk, 2:1:1 with slow release fertilizer (Osmocote 3 months) applied as required.

The actual planting was conducted in several steps. First, the area was surveyed for any of the trees planted in 2005 which had survived under the weeds. The survival rate was higher than initially expected, estimated at about 60-65%, but survival was very variable and patchy across the site, with more trees surviving along the northern and eastern sides of the site and very few in the middle and at the southern end. Bamboo stakes were placed by each surviving tree to make sure that they were visible and not damaged during site clearance and planting operations. Then the site was cleared of weeds by slashing them down to ground level. The place where each tree was to be planted was marked by 50-cm tall bamboo stakes. The stakes were placed randomly across the site, roughly 1.8 m apart, to create a natural looking layout to the restored forest. The saplings were loaded into baskets and distributed to each of the stakes. Beside each bamboo stake, a hoe was used to dig a hole, approximately twice the volume of the plastic bags in which the trees had been grown. The hoe was also used to dig out the weed roots in a circle 50-100 cm in diameter around the hole. The plastic bags were slashed with box cutters to remove the saplings without damaging the roots. Then the saplings were placed upright in holes. The space around the root ball was packed with loose soil, making sure that each sapling's root collar was eventually positioned level with the soil surface. Fifty grams of fertilizer (Rabbit brand, N P K 15-15-15) was then spread in a ring on the soil surface, about 10-20 cm away from the sapling stem. Finally, dead weeds were placed around each planted tree as mulch. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Monitoring to assess immediate post-planting mortality of trees planted in August 2006 has already been carried out, and the data are being analyzed. Initial results indicate zero mortality for most trees planted in 2006 and low mortality for the rest, including: Aquilaria crassna, Eugenia fruticosa, Ficus fistulosa, Magnolia baillonii, Nyssa javanica and Prunus cerasoides (all 4% mortality); Vitex quinata (8%) and Spondias axillaris (16%). This mortality may have been due to transplantation shock and to rough handling during transportation and planting and also due. Average density of trees planted in 2006 (surviving in 10 circular sample units (10 m in diameter) placed regularly across the site) was 17.6 (SD 7.47) which is equivalent to 359 trees per rai (1 rai = 0.16 ha). Trees surviving from previous plantings, as well as scattered, naturally-established trees, increased this density well above the required 500 per rai required for rapid canopy closure.

One of the most important outcomes of FORRU's research has been the identification of those species that can rapidly restore forest structure and function, while simultaneously enhancing natural forest regeneration and biodiversity recovery. The project has shown that forest cover can now be returned to highly degraded forestland (at 1,300 m elevation) within 3-4 years. Canopy closure starts to occur by the end of the second year after planting and is nearly complete by the end of the fourth. Weeds are shaded out and leaf litter starts to accumulate, re-establishing nutrient cycles. The trees attract seed-dispersing bird species resulting in the establishment of additional (non-planted) tree species and a gradual return to the tree species composition of the original forest.
The framework species approach proved to be suitable to restore evergreen forest at higher elevations in Southeast Asia. FORRU’s immediate priority is to extend this approach to the restoration of northern Thailand’s deciduous forest ecosystems at lower elevations.
Despite the success of this approach, further research on the diet and general ecology of seed-dispersing animals would help streamline the selection of framework tree species. The relationship between insects in planted plots and seed-dispersing birds and mammals is another topic in need of further investigation. Research thus far has indicated that the trees species most likely to attract these animals produce small to medium-sized fleshy fruits (e.g. Callicarpa arborea, Ficus semicordata, F. subulata, Phoebe lanceolata, Prunus cerasoide,) or flowers with copious quantities of nectar (e.g. Erythrina subumbrans) less than 4 years after planting. Tree species used by birds as nesting sites within 4 years after planting include: Balacata baccatum, Erythrina subumbrans, Eugenia albiflora, Ficus subulata , Ficus glaberima, Ficus semicordata, Helicia nilagirica, Hovenia dulcis, Prunus cerasoides, Quercus semiserrata, Rhus rhetsoides, and Turpinia pomifera. Monitoring will be ongoing, as will weeding and fertilizer applications. "

Due to its increasing fragility and inability to cope with further disturbances, the Eilat reef has been targeted for active restoration. Citing the ineffectiveness and impracticality of traditional coral transplantation techniques, project planners developed and implemented a new “coral gardening” method at Eilat. In situ, floating coral gardens were created using a flexible rope net to which coral fragments were affixed. Safe from predation and disturbance, the coral fragments quickly matured and were then transplanted into denuded areas of the reef. Observations thus far indicate that the gardening technique holds promise for quickly rearing adaptable, resilient coral gardens without causing heavy damage to donor sites or wasting time and resources on transplantation efforts that ultimately fail.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Reef degradation in this part of the northern Red Sea has proceeded gradually over the last four decades and has resulted from heedless development of the city of Eilat; eutrophication from intermittent municipal sewage outflow and mariculture activities; contamination from industrial installations; tourist activities; and other anthropogenic causes (e.g. frequent oil spills). Globally related phenomena (e.g. changing climatic conditions) have probably also played a role in the degradation of the Eilat reef system. Although situated along the most northern boundaries of coral reef distribution, the pristine reefs of the northern Gulf of Aqaba (ca. 30Â°N), along the shorelines of the Sinai Peninsula, exhibit extraordinary high within-habitat coral species diversity (sensu MacArthur 1972), among the highest in the world. – To restore the reef of Eilat using coral transplants reared in a newly developed floating nursery
– To assess the practicality of floating nurseries for reef restoration projects elsewhere in the world

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: In past restoration projects, whole coral colonies or coral ramets have been taken from healthy localities and transplanted into denuded areas. The low survival rates of these transplants and the stress caused to donor colonies have proven this method ineffective. Therefore, this project incorporated a new method, the ""gardening coral reefs concept,"" that uses forest restoration techniques to improve the overall effectiveness of coral reef restoration. The method consists of two steps: 1) generating and culturing minute coral recruits (i.e. spats, nubbins, coral fragments and small coral colonies) in an in situ, floating nursery; and 2) transplanting these colonies, when mature, in the degraded reef.

For this project, a mid-water, floating nursery was installed in a sheltered zone away from major natural reef areas, where it could have been damaged by tourists' activities and/or corallivorous organisms. The nursery was established at the Ardag fish farm facility, located at the northern shore of the Gulf of Eilat, Red Sea (29Âº32.45'N, 34Âº58.40'E), at a depth of 6m (14m above the sea bottom). The nursery consisted of a flexible rope net (10X10 meter size, 100 cm2 hole size) tied to cables anchoring a large fish cage (containing gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata).

Ramets from coral branching forms were pruned to small size fragments (0.5-2 cm high) and nubbins by the use of an electrician's wire cutter. Old and recently developed parts of each colony, as well as tip and mid-branch zones, were used as source material for fragment preparation. All colonies and colony fragments were collected from artificial substrates at the northern part of the Gulf and transported (submerged in seawater) to the nursery site.

Coral ramets and colonies were then affixed to plastic nets (0.25 cm2 mesh size) that were stretched over PVC frames (each 50X30 cm). These frames, with the attached coral, were tied to the rope net. In the nursery, almost 8000 coral fragments and colonies, positioned on ca. 80 plastic frames, were maricultured.

Once they reached maturity, five hundred and fifty nursery-grown colonies of two branching stony corals--Stylophora pistillata; Pocillopora damicornis-- were transplanted on several shallow-water, denuded knolls at 7-13m depth. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The results of the first ten monitoring months revealed low mortality rates for the new transplants. The transplanted colonies of both species were immediately colonized by coral-obligatory invertebrates including: Trapezia crabs, Spirobranchus worms and Alpheus shrimps. We also followed the transplantation's influence on the local fish community, witnessing an increase in species richness. Because the transplanted corals create new spatial and ecological niches for marine invertebrates and fish, they should stimulate a resurgence of reef-associated fauna. Furthermore, they can also be expected to increase the settlement of new coral colonies, as larvae tend to settle in areas where adult colonies already exist or in areas with exposed coral skeleton. Not only that, the transplanted colonies will also contribute to and enhance the local larval pool by participating in the reproductive process. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Many of the Stylophora transplants were surprisingly attacked by local fish (i.e. butterfly fish grazed on polyps, parrotfish damaged colonies by breaking whole branches). Fish attacks were rarely documented on Pocillopora colonies. Most damaged colonies survived, and with time, a large portion of the damaged colonies have started to regenerate lost parts.
This restoration technique has several advantages. First, transplanting new, whole colonies, rather than coral fragments, substantially increases their ability to acclimate to the new environment. It also reduces the stressed caused to donor colonies, as the new colony is reared from nubbins (1-10 polyps). Finally, the generation of thousands of new colonies allows for a rapid, larger-scale restoration.
Based on the studies conducted thus far, floating nurseries have been found to have several advantages over bottom nurseries: 1. Water flow: Increased water flow supplies the mid-water nursery system with large quantities of plankton particles, probably enhances the dissolved oxygen flow around the coral tissue, and helps remove mucus secreted by the coral tissue more efficiently; 2. Movement of the nursery: In sea bottom nurseries attached to the reef floor, water movement around the corals results strictly from currents or wave action. In a mid-water floating nursery, the whole nursery moves in the seawater column in all directions. This flexibility enables the nursery to further increase water exchange around the coral tissue and promotes a better elimination of debris, sedimentation particles and other settling material that might accumulate on developing coral colonies; 3. Sedimentation: One of the obstacles of raising coral colonies in affixed, substrate nurseries is the detrimental effect of sedimentation that may negatively influence the health and growth of corals. In the current mid-water nursery, the sea floor was 14 m down, and sedimentation was significantly reduced; 4. Photosynthesis activities: Mid-water nurseries can be depth adjusted according to the needs of each specific coral species. 5. Reduction in coral predators and other stressors: Shallow-water, sea-bottom nurseries are usually situated near natural reefs. This exposes them to corallivorous fish and invertebrates as well as to impacts from divers in tourist areas. Installing the nursery at a distance from the reef reduces the potential for harmful impacts from predators and recreational activities.
Although there are still many unknowns (e.g., multi-layer nursery, optimal nursery time and seasonality, optimal fragments size, number of ramets per genet, active maintenance, etc.), it is evident that the ability to produce and develop numerous coral colonies by means of this method may change the way end-users manage denuded reef areas. Monitoring at the site will continue in order to provide data on the survival rates of the transplants, their acclimatization and overall impacts on the environment. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-washington-paradise-meadow-restoration-mount-rainier/	USA: Washington: Paradise Meadow Restoration, Mount Rainier	United States of America	1986-07-27	1986-07-27	"The Paradise meadows, on the south slope of Mount Rainier in Washington State, have been subject to heavy recreational use since the early 1900s. Easily accessed from the main road through Mount Rainier National Park, Paradise hosts more than one million visitors per year and is the most frequented site in the park. The heavy volume of visitors, and the myriad impacts that result therefrom, has left many areas degraded and threatens the overall integrity of the ecosystem. In 1986, the National Park Service initiated a long-term restoration project aimed at rehabilitating and revegetating 913 impacted areas within the meadows. To date, approximately 10% of the targeted sites have been restored, and an education program has been launched in an attempt to raise public awareness about the fragility of the ecosystem and to encourage more responsible, conscientious use of park resources.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Many of the anthropogenic impacts visible at Paradise Meadows have resulted from activities that are no longer permitted: a tent camp (1890-1930’s), horse concession (1908-1965), golf course (1931), and ski concession (1934-1975). Horse travel resulted in trails 2-4 m wide and up to 0.6 m deep. Tent platforms and roads from the pre-existing tent camp are vegetated but still remain below grade and are easily recognized by topographic or vegetation differences from adjacent areas.
Although these historic causes of degradation have been allayed, recreational activities continue to have a significant impact, as Paradise Meadows is one of the most popular and accessible areas in Mount Rainier National Park. The area receives over 1.08 million visitors annually, and each day during peak season, thousands of park visitors stop at Paradise to hike, climb, eat, enjoy views of the mountain and tour the visitor center. Off-trail hiking is a major concern, as it has resulted in “social trails” and related erosion throughout several thousand acres of subalpine meadows. With up to 5,000 visits a day, even a small percentage of visitors deviating from established trails and encroaching onto the meadows has a detrimental impact. In fact, recent studies have shown that as few as fifteen people walking the same route through a subalpine meadow can cause noticeable damage to soils and vegetation. The subalpine zone is typified by tree “islands” mixed with open meadows. Several creeks and dozens of thin, murmuring rivulets flash down the slopes amid clumps of fir, cedar, and hemlock. Some trees here, referred to as krummholzes, are twisted and stunted due to severe winds and snow. Thus, trees only three feet in height may be centuries old.
By late July, when most of the snow has melted, a rainbow of wildflowers carpets the subalpine meadow – white avalanche lilies (Erythronium montanum), yellow marsh marigolds (Caltha leptosepala), purple lupine (Lupinus perennis), red mountainheath (Phyllodoce empetriformis), partridge foot (Luetkea pectinata), magenta paintbrush (Castilleja parviflora), and the plumed bear grass (Xerophyllum tenax). Glacier lilies (Erythronium grandiflorum) and snowbed buttercups (Ranunculus eschscholtzii) bloom at the treeline. To document and repair human-caused damage in the Paradise meadow

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Restoration of individual impacts involves 6 steps: scarification, stabilization, filling, revegetation, site protection, and monitoring. Many sites have become compacted and must be scarified to enhance root penetration and water percolation. Impacts deeper than 3 cm require stabilization to impede downhill movement of soil. Wood or rock silt bars are installed as subsurface erosion control structures. Following stabilization, the site is filled to the grade of the adjacent undisturbed area. Fill material consists of 3 components: rock, gravel, and topsoil. All topsoil is purchased from outside the park but specifications require it to be approximately the same soil texture, pH, and organic matter content as that of native soils. Soil is steam sterilized to prevent importation of exotic seeds. Once the site has been filled to grade, it is revegetated. Three revegetation techniques are used: seeding, transplanting, and natural revegetation. Most sites in Paradise are seeded and planted rather than allowed to revegetate solely by natural means. All seeds are collected as close to the impacted site as possible in order to maintain the genetic integrity of the site. Transplants are either salvaged from within the impacted site prior to filling or grown in the park's greenhouse from seeds or plant stock collected in close proximity to the impacted site. 

In 1984, the park's greenhouse program was started in a 312 square-foot greenhouse. Over the next decade, the shade houses were added and plant production was slowly increased from a first year production of 2,700 plants to 20,000 plants in 1994. In 1994, with the addition of a 864 square-foot cold frame, production increased to 34,000 plants. Also, in 1994 we received a private donation for a 1,800 square-foot greenhouse which was completed in 1996. Plant production increased to 40,000 in 1996. We are hoping to increase plant production to 50,000 to 60,000 plants annually while expanding our volunteer planting program. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Since 1986, approximately 90 (of the total 913) impact sites in the Paradise meadows have been stabilized and filled to grade, representing an area of 71,461 square feet out of a total target area of 516,709 square feet. Furthermore, 15 (6,681 square feet) of the 90 restored impact sites have been revegetated to the point that we feel we have completed active revegetation (i.e. planting and seeding).
Paradise Meadows is just one component of the Mount Rainier National Park’s park-wide restoration program. Because it has the highest visitor use within the park, Paradise exhibits the most severe human impacts and the greatest diversity of impacted sites. This range of degradation, along with the site’s accessibility, has made Paradise the model for all other areas currently undergoing, or slated to undergo, restoration. Indeed, Paradise has served as a sort of proving ground where restoration methods and techniques are refined before being employed in projects elsewhere in the park. Long-term management strategies focus on addressing the causes of degradation. Because the area is so heavily used for recreational purposes, an improved and expanded visitor education program will be crucial to the ultimate success of the restoration. Visitors need to be informed about fragile, high-elevation ecosystems and the potential impacts of human use. Approaches to heightening visitor awareness include: creating informative displays at the visitor center; offering daily slideshow programs on Paradise use and restoration; installing interpretive signs in the meadows; and roping off sensitive areas. A more creative facet of the campaign to educate meadow users involved the distribution of buttons reading: “Don’t Be A Meadow Stomper!” It was hoped that these buttons would invest conscientious users with a sense of responsibility and stewardship for the meadows.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-louisiana-the-duralde-cajun-prairie-restoration-project-evangeline-parish/	USA: Louisiana: The Duralde Cajun Prairie Restoration Project, Evangeline Parish	United States of America	1994-07-26	1994-07-26	"Coastal tallgrass prairie was once abundant along the Gulf of Mexico in southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana. However, land conversion for agriculture and livestock has reduced the coastal prairie to under 1% of its pre-settlement area–from over 9 million acres to approximately 65,000 acres. Of this remaining area, only 100 acres can now be found in the state of Louisiana, and most of these are narrow strips lying along railroad rights-of-way. Due to the dire need for preservation of this endangered ecosystem, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service initiated the Duralde Cajun Prairie Restoration Project in Evangeline Parish in 1994. Project planners first arranged the purchase of 334 acres of Cajun Prairie (as the coastal prairie in Louisiana is known) and then conducted a range of restoration activities. The clearing of invasive tallow trees was the first step taken, and native plant species were later reintroduced by either transplanting native vegetation from imperiled prairie remnants or sowing seeds from the air. Observations made thus far suggest that transplanting has been more effective than seeding and that seeded areas may take as long as 10 years to fully recover. Nevertheless, more than 100 species of native Cajun Prairie plants have been re-established, and practitioners are hopeful that the site will eventually become an important sanctuary for the many species that depend upon the waning coastal prairie ecosystem for their survival.Agriculture & Livestock Today, substantially less than one percent of the coastal prairie remains. Although much of the former prairie has been converted to pasture for cattle grazing, the large majority has been destroyed for agriculture–sugarcane, grain crops and, in particular, rice. In Louisiana, the few remaining remnants of coastal prairie are narrow strips of land found along railroad rights-of-way. Most of these remnants are less than 30 meters wide, and the longest unbroken strips are only about 800 meters long. This extant prairie was either never tilled or has not been tilled since the railroad acquired the land ca 150 years ago.
The estimated total area of intact Cajun Prairie (i.e. coastal prairie in Louisiana) is only 100 acres (Allen and Vidrine 1989). This ecosystem is ranked G2 (imperiled globally because of rarity or because of some factor(s) making it vulnerable to extirpation) by the Nature Conservancy (Grossman et al. 1994), and in Louisiana it is ranked S1 (critically imperiled in state because of extreme rarity or because of some factor(s) making it especially vulnerable to extirpation from the state) by the Natural Heritage Program (Smith 1995). While agriculture and livestock have historically been the primary causes of degradation, development now poses the greatest risk to what remains of the coastal prairie, as most of the above-mentioned remnants are privately held, with only a small percentage preserved on government land. Coastal Prairie vegetation is extremely diverse and dominated by grasses, including: Paspalum plicatulum (brownseed paspalum), Paspalum spp. (paspy grasses), Schizachyrium scoparium and S. tenerum (little and slender bluestem), Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem), Andropogon spp. (broomsedges), Aristida spp. (three-awn grasses), Eragrostis spp. (love grasses), Spartina patens (wire grass, near marshes), Panicum virgatum (switch grass), Panicum spp. (panic grasses), Sorghastrum nutans (Indian grass), Sporobolus spp. (dropseeds), and Tridens spp. (purple-top). Important sedges in the community include Carex spp. (caric sedges), Cyperus spp. (umbrella sedges), Rhynchospora spp. (beaked sedges), and Scleria spp. (nut-rushes). An abundance of forbs is present including Cacalia ovata (Indian platain), Helianthus mollis (sunflower), Liatris spp. (blazing-stars), Asclepias spp. (milkweeds), Silphium spp. (rosin-weeds), Petalostemum spp. (prairie clovers), Baptisia spp. (indigos), Amsonia tabernaemontana (blue star), Rudbeckia spp. (brown-eyed susans), Euphorbia spp. (spurges), Euthamia spp. (flat-topped goldenrods), Hedyotis nigricans (bluets), Ruellia humilis (wild petunia), Ludwigia spp. (water primroses), Coreopsis spp. (tickseeds), Solidago spp. (goldenrods), Agalinis spp. (false foxgloves), and Eupatorium spp. (thoroughworts) (Allen et al. 2001, Grace et al. 2000, LNHP 1986-2004). Many plants in Coastal Prairie also occur in the pine savannahs and flatwoods that occur immediately north of the coastal prairie region. These include many of the above, plus Drosera brevifolia (sundew), Polygala spp. (milkworts), Aletris spp. (colic-roots), Rhexia spp. (meadow beauties), and Sabatia spp. (rose-gentians). As mentioned previously, fire plays a critical role in this natural community. Certain woody species may invade this habitat without periodic fire. The introduced species Triadica sebifera (=Sapium sebiferum; Chinese tallow tree) has become especially problematic, forming dense thickets or forests. The transition zone from coastal prairie to pine savannah is extremely diverse with the two habitat types sharing most herbaceous species in the transitional area. Baygalls or bayhead swamps may be included within coastal prairie.
In addition to plants, coastal prairie and its adjacent marsh habitat provide immense spaces for waterfowl and thousands of other forms of wildlife. Waterfowl, sandpipers, and other shorebirds are abundant during the fall, winter, and spring months, paralleling and often surpassing other regions with longstanding traditions as crucial stopover areas for these species. Many rare European species, such as northern wheatear, black-tailed godwit, curlew sandpiper, and ruff, have also been routinely observed.
The coastal prairie is also home to the federally endangered Attwater’s prairie chicken (North America’s most endangered bird), and is the exclusive wintering ground of the federally-endangered whooping crane. Other residents such as the gulf coast hognosed skunk and the Cagle’s map turtle are also critically imperiled. A number of rare migratory grassland birds depend on coastal grasslands, including: the loggerhead shrike and Bachman’s, Henslow’s, and Texas olive sparrows. To restore degraded Cajun Prairie to the project site and thereby expand the remaining area of this critically endangered ecosystem.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: In February 1993, the title to a 334-acre FmHa easement tract was transferred to the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service. This tract is located in Evangeline Parish between Eunice and Mamou, Louisiana. The site was an abandoned agricultural area that was covered with thousands of Chinese Tallow Trees (Sapium sebiferum). The Tallow Trees were uprooted with bull dozers, wind rowed, and burned. The area was then disked and the levees removed.

In January 1995, volunteers and Lacassine Wildlife personnel transplanted several truck loads of Cajun Prairie plants onto the site. The Cajun Prairie plants were obtained from a nearby remnant strip. A centrally located 90-acre portion of the tract was redisked in the spring of 1995. Using an airplane, seeds were sown on the 90 acres on May 2 and 9. The seeds included 270 lbs of Eastern Gamma Grass (Tripsacum dactyloides), 61 lbs of Aldous Little Bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), 171 lbs of Kaw Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), 109 lbs of Cheyenne Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), and 54 lbs of Alamo Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). Seeds were again collected from remnants and sown into parts of the 90-acre plot in January 1996.

In August 1998, seeds that were harvested from Attwater Prairie Chicken NWR in Texas were spread across the remaining acreage (244 acres). Also, in 1998 an experiment was begun to test the best time of year to plant seeds. Seeds were harvested from remnants and divided into four equal lots; one lot was planted in December 1998, two in February 1999, and one May 1999, with the two lots planted in February sown at two different sites. The results indicate that December was slightly better than February, and both December and February were much better than May. In the dormant seasons of 1998-99, 1999-2000, and 2000-2001, transplants were dug from remnants and transplanted into the Duralde prairie. In November 2000, seeds of 50 selected Cajun Prairie forbs were planted in monocultural plots. These seeds came from different remnants and are being planted together to test for increased seed production. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Areas that were subject to transplanting are close to being 100% restored back to Cajun Prairie. The seeded areas, on the other hand, are taking much longer, and it appears that they could require as long as ten years to become fully restored. More than 100 species of native Cajun Prairie plants now call this site home, and a number of native grasses have become well established. In the 90-acre tract, the dominant grasses are eastern gamma and switch grass, while in the 244-acre tract, the dominant grass is little bluestem. The occurrence of other grasses is low, but small clumps can be found scattered across the entire refuge. Some of the more conspicuous forbs that have become established include several species of button snakeroot (Eryngium yuccifolium), hairy sunflower (Helianthus mollis), and sweet goldenrod (Solidago odora).
The Duralde Cajun Prairie Project is the only Cajun Prairie restoration currently being undertaken on federally-owned land. It is hoped that these 334 acres will serve as a refugium for Cajun Prairie plants and animals and that they will mitigate the consequences of any further destruction of the remaining remnant strips. Tallow trees (Sapium sebiferum) are the major concern for the long-term success of the project. The principal means of controlling this pest on the restored areas has been the use of approved herbicides. Very few tallows can be seen across the 334-acre tract, and it appears as though this pest has been kept under control for the moment. However, all project participants recognize that it continues to be a problem, and a constant vigil is maintained to prevent its recolonization.
Besides efforts to curtain the spread of tallow trees, management strategies also include controlled burning. The Duralde Cajun Prairie site has been treated annually with controlled burns since the inception of the restoration. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/new-zealand-forest-restoration-at-aratiatia-north-island/	New Zealand: Forest Restoration at Aratiatia, North Island	New Zealand	1962-07-25	1980-07-25	"The construction of a hydroelectric dam along New Zealand’s Waikato River in 1964 resulted in the degradation of more than 108 hectares of native forest. The site’s proximity to a major tourist destination, Aratiatia Rapids, prompted the government to conduct a revegetation effort aimed at improving the aesthetic qualities of the area and, thus, ensuring the continued vitality of the tourism industry there. Forty-six native species of trees and shrubs were initially sown–all fast-growing and short-lived–and sites where planting failed were subsequently planted again. In 1999, 35 years after the plantation of the oldest regenerated stands, a detailed analysis of the forest’s recovery was undertaken in order to evaluate the long-term success of the project; assess how closely planted forest simulates naturally-regenerated stands of similar age; evaluate the effect of canopy composition on subsequent vegetation development; and understand dispersal modes and other life-history attributes of successfully regenerating species. Findings from this study indicate that the planting effort succeeded in creating native forest that mimics young secondary forest on relatively inhospitable new surfaces. If not for the attempt at restoration, the degraded sites would now support only weedy adventive shrubland.Deforestation Extensive hydroelectric development of the Waikato River, New Zealand’s longest and second largest, was undertaken by the former New Zealand Electricity Department in the decades following the Second World War. It involved local destruction of natural landscapes, and at Aratiatia, the last dam built on the river, losses of major aesthetic and tourist values in the vicinity of a nationally significant tourist attraction, Aratiatia Rapids. Historical records (Kirk 1872) of pre-European vegetation pattern in the district, inference (Nicholls 1986), and extant evidence (Podocarpus totara (totara) logs buried beneath tephra) suggest that broadleaved forest with scattered emergent conifers constituted the primary forest. Conifers, mostly P. totara and Prumnopitys taxifolia (matai), were locally dominant on flatter sites with deeper tephra deposits and subject to cold air ponding. The most characteristic mesophytic broadleaved trees and shrubs were probably Knightia excelsa (rewarewa), Weinmannia racemosa (kamahi), Elaeocarpus dentatus (hinau), Nestegis cunninghamii (black maire), Melicytus ramiflorus (mahoe), Pseudopanax arboreus (five finger), Fuchsia excorticata (tree fuchsia), Schefflera digitata (pate), and Coprosma grandifolia (McKelvey 1963). The original replanting project, the first large-scale attempt at ecological restoration in New Zealand, was undertaken to restore woody vegetation to unaesthetic patches of bare ground resulting from the construction of a hydroelectric dam.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Because of its proximity to Aratiatia Rapids, a popular tourist destination, this project is of particular interest to stakeholders in the tourism industry. However, members of surrounding communities, whose livelihoods can be expected to benefit (even if indirectly) from increased tourism, are also stakeholders in the project.

Description of Project Activities: Rehabilitation of grossly disturbed areas was undertaken at the completion of dam construction in 1964. It involved extensive redistribution of largely unsorted regolith. Subsequent artificial contouring to create rolling slopes on gentler topography and alternating benches and faces on steeper sites mimicked the landforms present earlier. A two-stage planting scheme using only native species followed (F.S.R. Jackson and J. Greenwood 1995, personal communication), aimed at simulating natural successions in the locality.

(1) Fast-growing, short-lived shrubs--Hebe stricta var. stricta (koromiko), Coprosma robusta (karamu), C. lucida, Leptospermum scoparium (manuka), and Brachyglottis repanda (rangiora)--were planted as nurse vegetation on bare substrates, with subsequent spot herbiciding of adventive grasses when required.
(2) Fast-growing, short-lived small trees such as P. tenuifolium, K. ericoides, Sophora tetraptera (kowhai), and Cordyline australis (cabbage tree) along with longer-lived medium-sized (e.g. Griselinia littoralis [broad-leaf]) and tall (e.g. P. totara) trees were interplanted about 5 years later.

Although at least 46 native species were planted, including at least eight not indigenous to the district, only a handful of species was widely planted. Local seed sources were used for species naturally present. Planting stock was initially bare-rooted, later potted, and later still placed in root-trainers. Where initial planting failed, sites were replanted, sometimes several times. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Construction of the hydroelectric dam was completed in 1964, and reforestation of the denuded areas began in the years immediately thereafter. Synthetic forest now covers some 108 hectares (B.R. Clarkson, unpublished data) along 5 km of the Waikato River. In 1999, a detailed analysis of the restored sites was undertaken. Sampling was confined to new surfaces devoid of vegetation at the time of the dam's completion. Few grossly disturbed areas were left unplanted over the ensuing 18 years, making it difficult to find comparable samples of unplanted ground, which might or might not have been subject to planting attempts. Fifty temporary plots, varying in size between 36 and 64 square meters, and large enough to include 15-20 canopy individuals, were randomly placed in homogenous patches of vegetation, 36 in planted areas and 14 in adjacent unplanted or unsuccessfully planted areas. 

Three canopy communities were identified by TWINSPAN classification of basal area of woody species.
(1) Adventive Cytisus scoparius (broom) shrubland (10-23 years) up to 4 m tall, almost entirely on unplanted sites with C. scoparius the only woody species consistently present, i.e. occurring in at least half the plots (12 plots).
(2) Pittosporum tenuifolium-Kunzea ericoides short forest (15-33 years) up to 9 m tall with a scattered Hebe stricta understory (21 plots), almost all on planted sites; natural Podocarpus totara and Coprosma robusta seedlings were consistently present.
(3) Pittosporum tenuifolium-Sophora tetraptera short forest (14-31 years) up to 10 m tall, solely on planted sites (17 plots), with natural Melicytus ramiflorus, Aristotelia serrata (wineberry), Cordyline australis, P. totara, and C. robusta seedlings characteristically present.

Four ground layer communities were identified from the TWINSPAN classification of cover scores. Two were dominated by adventive grasses:
(1) Dactylis glomerata (cocksfoot)-Holcus lanatus (Yorkshire fog)-Festuca rubra (Chewing's fescue) grassland with Anthoxanthum odoratum (sweet vernal), Agrostis capillaris (browntop), and Lotus pedunculatus (birdsfoot trefoil) also consistently present occurred mostly on unplanted sites, and
(2) A. odoratum-A. capillaris grassland with L. pedunculatus and D. glomerata consistently present mostly (71%) on planted sites.

The remaining two communities, wholly on planted sites, were dominated by litter:
(3) Mosses were widespread in one, while
(4) Muehlenbeckia australis (pohuehue), Pteridium esculentum, and adventive Rubus fruticosus agg. were characteristically present in the other.

Eighty-three vascular species were recorded on planted sites, two-thirds of them native; trees and shrubs (53%) and ferns and fern-allies (29%) dominated the native component. Of 46 planted native species, 23 were recorded in planted plots and others were noted outside them. In addition, 30 unplanted native species were founding plots, comprising five trees and shrubs (all with bird-dispersed fruit), four lianas (two with bird-dispersed fruit, two with wind-dispersed fruit), sixteen ferns and fern-allies, and five grasses and herbs. Forty-one species were recorded on unplanted sites, nearly three-quarters of them adventive; grasses and herbs (59%) dominated the adventive component. All species are common, widespread plants.

Although the dozen or so commonly planted species at Aratiatia are now reproductively mature, ephemeral seedlings of only four, C. robusta, P. tenuifolium, P. totara, and A. serrata, occurred in at least one-quarter of planted plots. Of these, only C. robusta was consistently present, occurring in 77% of plots. Ephemeral seedlings of other commonly planted species--C. australis, Pseudopanax arboreus, S. tetraptera, H. stricta (8%), K. ericoides, and Pittosporum eugenioides (lemonwood) (3%)--were more local. Despite limited planting, ephemeral seedlings of Myrsine australis (mapou), M. ramiflorus, and Griselinia littoralis were widespread.

Established seedlings were less widespread, with only one commonly planted species, S. tetraptera, occurring in at least one-quarter of planted plots. Established seedlings of other commonly planted species, P. totara, C. australis, and A. serrata, were somewhat more local, but again, seldom-planted M. ramiflorus, G. littoralis, and M. australis were unexpectedly widespread.

Major differences in regeneration patterns were evident between the two planted communities. Established seedlings of seven canopy species were reasonably widespread in Pittosporum-Sophora forest, but only two (S. tetraptera and P. totara) in Pittosporum-Kunzea forest. Indigenous vascular species richness was much higher in Pittosporum-Sophora forest (51 species total) than in Pittosporum-Kunzea forest (28 species), with the cumulative species/area curves following quite different paths.
Despite the proximity of seed sources in planted stands, seedlings of only five planted tree and shrub species--P. tenuifolium, P. totara, A. serrata, G.littoralis, and C. robusta--were recorded on unplanted sites, none of them commonly, and only as ephemeral seedlings. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The lifespan of pioneering (in this case planted) species is likely to be an important determinant of the duration of primary successional pathways (Druce 1957; Wassiliev 1982). With the oldest stands now aged 33 years, planted forest at Aratiatia may be expected to begin senescing and collapsing in some 20 years' time.

Early stages of natural secondary succession on intact substrates in the locality are now dominated variously by Pteridium esculentum and adventive Rubus frutiscosus and Ulex europaeus (B.R. Clarkson, unpublished data). Later stages--short forest dominated by P. tenuifolium, K. ericoides, and Pseudopanax arboreus--may pre-date the advent of weedy adventive shrubs in the district. P. esculentum stands elsewhere can persist for 30 years or more (Wassiliev 1982), U. europaeus even longer (Druce 1957). P. tenuifolium invades moderately dense P. esculentum stands in dry regions, and P. arboreus invades P. esculentum (Wardle 1991) and K. ericoides stands (Esler 1967) in wetter ones. K. ericoides also establishes directly on bare substrates such as dune sands (Smale 1994) and mudstone (Smale et al. 1997) and in short open pasture (Grant 1967). Divergences between these natural secondary successions on intact substrates and primary successions on unplanted new surfaces at Aratiatia may result from the poorer physical or chemical properties of the latter. For example, the scarcity of P. esculentum on unplanted sites probably reflects its dislike of compacted soils, and the absence of U. europaeus its need for a moderate level of soil fertility (Wardle 1991).

Planted stands now mimic young secondary forests in the district which developed before the advent of weedy adventive shrubs, having bypassed earlier successional communities dominated by P. esculentum. Amongst conifers, P. totara seedlings originating from plantings are already widespread, but only a few planted Prumnopitys taxifolia are present. Natural seedlings of some broadleaved trees and shrubs (e.g. M. ramiflorus, P. arboreus) are reasonably widespread, while others (e.g. Fuchsia excorticate, Coprosma grandifolia) are more local. Still others (e.g. Knightia excelsa, Weinmannia racemosa, and Schefflera digitata) are absent from planted stands. Although some of them were planted and others still occur naturally in the locality (B.R. Clarkson, unpublished data), seed sources may be too small and distant for effective dispersal into planted stands.

Major differences in floristic richness and regeneration patterns, and thus successional pathways, are evident between the two planted forest communities, as elsewhere in New Zealand (Stewart & Woods 1997). Established seedlings of seven canopy species are reasonably widespread in species-rich Pittosporum-Sophora forest and may foreshadow the development of a conifer/mixed broadleaved forest. In species-poor Pittosporum-Kunzea forest, however, seedlings of only two canopy species--S. tetraptera and Podocarpus totara--are at all common. Podocarpus totara is among the most light-demanding of New Zealand podocarps (Ogden & Stewart 1995), commonly establishing directly in degraded pasture from seed sources nearby. Enright and Ogden (1995) suggest that ""southern conifers (such as P. totara) are prime candidates for habitat restoration, despite the inevitably slow rate at which they form mature forests, because success is virtually guaranteed at minimal cost."" Despite the lack of site amelioration, P. totara at Aratiatia has grown as well as in plantations on more amenable sites with intact regolith (Pardy et al. 1992). By contrast, growth rates of the most commonly planted species at Aratiatia, Pittosporum tenuifolium and K. ericoides, are much slower than those of similar-aged trees planted on more amenable sites (Pardy et al. 1992). The greater success of P. totara in terms of growth rate and regeneration suggests that fast-growing, short-lived shrubs and small trees could have been bypassed and P. totara planted directly on new surfaces to form long-lived (normal lifespan approx. 600 years: Ebbett 1992, unpublished thesis), large-stature, aesthetically pleasing conifer stands.

Almost all the commonly regenerating species in synthetic forest at Aratiatia are bird-distributed, as in other documented restoration plantings in New Zealand (Reay & Norton 1999). The greater abundance of seedlings in Pittosporum-Sophora than Pittosporum-Kunzea forest may reflect the presence of mature S. tetraptera, a species which attracts nectar-feeding birds such as the native honeyeater Prosthemadera novaseelandiae (tui), a major disperser of small-fruited native trees and shrubs (Beveridge 1964). The shallow litter common under Pittosporum-Sophora forest may also provide a more hospitable substrate for seedling establishment than the grass swards typical of Pittosporum-Kunzea forest. Mean aspect and slope, factors that might be expected to affect soil moisture regimes and therefore seedling establishment, scarcely differ between the sites occupied by the two communities.
After three decades, gross differences are now evident between the plant communities on planted and unplanted or unsuccessfully planted sites at Aratiatia, and between the successional pathways likely to occur in them. In aesthetic terms, the large-scale planting of fast-growing, short-lived native shrubs and trees has been outstandingly successful in restoring woody vegetation to large areas of unsightly bare ground next to a major tourist attraction.
Although undertaken essentially for aesthetic reasons, this restoration also appears to have been successful, so far, in ecological terms. It has rapidly established native forest that mimics young secondary forest on relatively inhospitable new surfaces, which would otherwise now support only weedy adventive shrubland. Some planted early successional species have begun regenerating. With limited seed sources nearby, many later successional trees and shrubs of the region are still absent, and it is too early to predict the longer-term future of synthetic forest, particularly floristically-poor Pittosporum-Kunzea forest with its grassy gound layer. Only continued monitoring will show whether further management (beyond the landscape reconstruction and planting already carried out) is necessary, or whether natural processes are operating at a level sufficient to ensure that development of the vegetation will continue along relatively natural pathways.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/china-grassland-restoration-in-the-inner-mongolia-autonomous-region/	China: Grassland Restoration in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region	China	2000-07-23	2005-07-23	"The degradation of grasslands has become a serious problem in China, as once-productive lands are being lost to desertification and destructive sandstorms are occurring with increasing frequency. Past restoration efforts have focused on planting trees to mitigate these storms and disseminating seeds from airplanes in an attempt to re-establish native vegetation. Because these techniques have proven largely unsuccessful, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) conducted a pilot project in the Hunshandake Sandland of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in order to test the potential for natural revegetation. Large tracts of severely degraded grassland were enclosed and protected from grazing and human interference, while smaller plots were planted with necessary forage for the livestock of local villagers. Given reprieve from anthropogenic pressures, the degraded grasslands showed remarkable recovery after only a couple years of monitoring, and have led the Chinese government to re-examine its policies and practices for grassland restoration. It is now thought that restoration through effective, strategic land management has the potential to produce desired results more quickly than other conventional approaches.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The primary reason for degrading grassland ecosystems in Inner Mongolia is the region’s exploding population (McNaughton, 1990; Ware, 1997). Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, the Xilingol League’s population has grown from 205,000 to a current total of 920,000, a net increase of 348% (Compiling Committee of the Annals of the Xilin Gol League, 1996). In the wake of this population increase, and the insatiable demand for better material conditions, the number of domestic livestock has also increased dramatically from 1.6 million to 23 million head, a net increase of 1338%. In this way, the foraging pressure on the grasslands goes up at such a fast rate that very soon it exceeds the bearable limits of the whole grassland ecosystem. Indeed, the average pasture area to support a standard sheep’s survival has dropped from 5.13 to 0.467 hectares. This means the net grazing pressure on the grasslands sees an increase of up to 950%.
Another contributing factor in the grasslands’ degradation has been the change in community lifestyle and the corresponding shift in policy orientation. Beginning in the 1990s, the traditional nomadism of local inhabitants was replaced by fixed settlements, and this has led to an increasing trend toward grassland depletion, as more emphasis is placed on modernization and improved standards of living. One common result of the increased pressure from more sedentary lifestyles can be characterized as follows: after a long, tedious and famine-prone winter, the livestock scramble to the sensitive budding grass in early spring when it is still developing the photosynthetic organs that stimulate its initial growth. If the grazing livestock is not too numerous (i.e. if population density is not too high), the ravage caused in the early spring may be compensated for by nature itself. If, however, the grazing activity is widespread, the budding grasses are too suppressed to grow soundly. Thus, year by year, a malignant cycle comes into being whereby fewer grasses emerge and are grazed even more heavily than the year before.
According to the project’s monitoring and observation data, during the 1970s, the land desertification rate in China was 1,560 square kilometers per year. The figure became 2,100 square kilometers during the 1980s, 2,460 square kilometers during the early five years of the 1990s, and 3,436 square kilometers during the following five years (National Environmental Protection General Agency, 2005.). The environmental disaster caused most directly by the ecological depletion of sandy grasslands is the sandstorm (Shu and Jiang, 2002). During the past 100 years, China has been hit by almost 70 sandstorms. During the first 30-40 years of the last century, a sandstorm occurred once every three years on average, and the situation has only become more aggravated in the last decade or so. In fact, there was only one recorded sandstorm from 1930 to 1960, and then one every two years during the 1960s and 1970s. The frequency of sandstorms has since increased dramatically: one each year in the 1990s; 12 storms in 2000 alone; and a staggering total of 18 occurrences of dusty weather in 2001, including a strong sandstorm that lasted 41 days in a row. From March 18 to 21, 2002, most areas in northern China experienced the most ferocious dusty weather since the start of the 20th century, with a land surface of up to 1.4 million square kilometers affected by the storm. Originally home to more than 800 advanced plant species and five habitats — fixed dunes, semi-fixed dunes, shifting dunes, lowland and wetland — Hunshandake resembled an African Savannah landscape, rich in elms, grasses, lakes, wild geese and wolves. To assess the plausibility of conducting grassland restoration using careful land management to encourage natural recovery, in lieu of planting trees or employing costly airplane seeding.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Initially, 100,000 yuan (13,000 U.S. dollars) worth of willows were planted on the degraded land because ""conventional thinking held that planting trees is the best solution for curbing desertification and sandstorms"". A root hormone was used to foster the growth of the willows, but to no avail, as all the trees withered and died in a year's time. In a semi-arid area with less than 300 mm in annual precipitation, the trees were like ""water-pumping machines,"" and the sandland simply could not sustain them.

Facing an uncomfortable truth and unwilling to repeat the mistakes of the past, the research team shifted its focus away from re-forestation and opted instead to adopt a new strategy of ""nurturing the land by the land itself."" The approach essentially concentrated on improving the efficiency of land use practices in order to keep larger tracts of land unused and undisturbed so that they might recuperate themselves via natural processes. Agrarian production was reshaped such that working plots were established in areas where the supply of water, electricity, fertilizers, transportation access and agronomic techniques were reliable. Forage material for the animals was planted on these plots in order to satisfy the requirements of the local population. At the same time, the seriously degraded grassland (accounting for 99 per cent of the total area) was enclosed and protected from livestock grazing and fuel gathering in order to facilitate the natural recovery of native vegetation.  The ratio of working land to protected land might be set as low as 1:100. The reason for such a low ratio is that, at present, a depleted ecosystem has very low productivity. For example, the fresh biomass production rate for a degenerated meadow is 450-1500 kg per hectare, whereas the figure might rise to 90,000 kg per hectare after technical treatment. To supplement the loss of forage resulting from grassland fencing, project planners delineated 67 hectares of land adjacent to the fenced area as a forage base that produced high-yield corn. Meanwhile, the 2670-hectare grassland was left to mend without human interference. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The results of this project indicate that, without grazing, formerly degraded grassland can recover rapidly through natural processes in 5 years (Jiang et al, 2006). The herbal plants exhibited an all-round restoration in the first year, with coverage up to 100% and grass height of more than 80cm. The results after the second year were stunning: grass height was up to 1.43 meters, and fresh forage harvest averaged a record 79.5 tons per hectare. Moreover, the natural germination rate of two-year-old elm seedlings was 321 saplings per square meter. The average biomass increased twofold, and the mean coverage in shifting sand dunes increased by about 60 per cent. In fixed sand dunes, total community coverage was three times that of the control site (Liu et al., 2003). The original dominant species Artemisia frigida and Artemisia commutata were replaced by Artemisia intramongolica and Agropyron cristatum and so on. Prior to the experiment, the predominant species were Chenopodium glaucum and Chenopodium acuminatum, but the ascendant species in the lowland are now Festuca ovina and Elymus dahuricus. The degenerated vegetation in the study area was restored to a condition on par with that of the 1960s.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: This CAS program has triggered a series of changes in the region, both in terms of material wealth and the way people think. More than one-third of the villagers now have access to electricity, and annual income per person has risen from 2400 yuan (314 U.S. dollars) in 2000 to 2700 yuan (353 U.S. dollars) in 2004. This rise in income is partly due to the fact that from 1998 to 2002, the survival rate of young animals increased by 10 percent, and milk production by 200 percent, as a result of the sufficient forage supply. Another factor contributing to higher incomes is the improved annual harvest of dried hay. Totaling over 10,000 tons per year, dried hay now represents more than four million yuan for the local economy (at the current price of 0.4 yuan per kilogram). Because the required management input for recovering lands is fairly low (160,000 yuan for building fences and enclosures and approximately 10,000 yuan for security fees), the majority of these income benefits directly contributes to an improved standard of living and greater economic security for local villagers.
As a result of the favorable outcomes achieved by this project, the Central Government of China has finally changed its policies regarding the restoration of degraded grasslands. Before the year 2000, there was no voice against planting trees in the steppe, and few restoration efforts took into account the well being of the people living in degraded lands in these arid or semi-arid regions. It has been shown that before any of the projects combating desertification in grasslands can work properly, we must allow the forces of nature to restore the degraded lands. The people living in these areas should then be well looked after. Tree planting in the steppe should be prevented, especially the planting of single tree species such as Populus spp. Ecological services, rather than the direct utilization of land with lower productivities, should be stressed in areas such as desert, sandland, steppe and so on. Shifting of land use function should also be considered, such as breeding animals in farm areas while farming chickens in the steppe. Having seen the potential for natural recovery, project planners hope to upgrade restored areas to the status of natural reserves under administrative protection (Peng et al, 2004). "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/india-tamil-nadu-tropical-forest-restoration-in-the-auroville-township/	India: Tamil Nadu: Tropical Forest Restoration in the Auroville Township	India	1970-07-20	1970-07-20	"In the late 1960s, the Auroville Township was founded as an intentional community in the state of Tamil Nadu in southern India. Upon their arrival, the township’s first residents found a severely degraded forest ecosystem that had become a barren plain largely devoid of shade and water. In the absence of vegetation, erosion from monsoon rains was a serious threat, as it had already washed away much of the topsoil. Thus, beginning in the early 1970s, Aurovilian “greenworkers” (as they came to be known) undertook a concerted effort to replant trees and construct catchment systems to trap rainwater. Initially intended as a means of improving living conditions at the Auroville Township site and the immediate vicinity, the success of the ongoing reforestation project has since gained local and national attention, and is raising awareness about the importance of rehabilitating and conserving valuable forest resources in India. Representatives from Auroville have now begun to network with other organizations in order to share their knowledge and ensure that the lessons learned at Auroville will serve as a model for the restoration of other degraded areas throughout the country.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation, Mining & Resource Extraction Around two hundred years ago, the Auroville plateau and its surrounding region were covered in forest. In fact, a stone was discovered in Kilianur dating from 1750 that described the local king hunting for elephants and tigers in the nearby forest. In 1825, trees were felled in the Jipmer area between Auroville and Pondy, to drive away the tigers. Slowly the forests were cut down to build cities like Pondicherry and towns like Kalapet. Timber was used for export, and the British accelerated the deforestation process by allocating plots of land to anyone who would clear it and cultivate it for a year. Much of the land was then left fallow, and under the violent onslaught of the monsoon, erosion inevitably began. The last remaining plots of forest in the Auroville area – 2,000 mature neem trees – were cut down in the mid-1950s for timber to make boats. In less than 200 years, land that was once forested had turned into an expanse of baked red earth scarred with gullies and ravines carved by the monsoon floods. Each year tons of the remaining topsoil were swept into the nearby Bay of Bengal, and much of the land that remained became a desertified wasteland. By the end of the colonial period the extent of the forest was reduced to 1% of its normal distribution, and in subsequent times all of these reserve forests have become highly degraded. The timber trees of any size were removed, and then the remaining scrub was harvested for firewood and subjected to constant browsing by goats and cows. The only surviving forest areas that have any resemblance to their pristine state are widely scattered pockets around temples, and these rarely exceed a few acres. The TDEF ecosystem has a canopy rarely higher than 8m tall, with trees interlinked by lianas. The forest floor has a thick layer of leaf matter that is efficiently recycled by a dense mass of feeder roots in the top centimeter of the soil. Some of the common species of the forest include: Atalantia monophylla, Diospyros ebenum, Drypetes sepiaria, Garcinia spicata, Glycosmis mauritiana, Ixora pavetta, Lepisanthes tetraphylla, Manilkara hexandra, Memecylon umbellatum, Pterospermum suberifolium, and Syzygium cumini. Other important components of the ecosystem include liana such as Combretum ovalifolium and Capparis zeylanica, and both epiphytic (e.g. Vandia tesselata) and pseudobulbous (e.g. Eulophia epidendraea) orchids. To restore the tropical dry evergreen forest around the Auroville Township in southern India

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Initial restoration activities by the first Aurovillian settlers were largely aimed at creating shade and eliminating runoff of rainwater from the plateau. Activities included the planting of both exotic pioneer species, such as Acacia auriculiformis, Cassia siamea, Eucalyptus sp., and Khaya senagalensis, and native pioneer species including Azidiracta indica, Bridelia retusa, Lannea coromandelica, Morinda pubescens, and Pterocarpus santalinus. The non-native species were largely more successful and became well-established.

Other initial activities included water and soil conservation work, including the establishment of bunding grids (raised banks of earth following contours or field boundaries) designed to contain rainwater. Check-dams and gully plugs were constructed in ravines to catch any remaining runoff, and existing catchment ponds were de-silted and enlarged. These measures helped to stop the erosion previously caused by water movement and, as the vegetation grew, helped Auroville to achieve its goal of ""˜zero run-off'.

By the early 1990s the next stage of the restoration work was taking shape. A group of Aurovillians studied the botany of local plants and surveyed the remnants of the indigenous flora, primarily in reserved forests and temple groves. Plants were identified, seeds collected, and germination techniques determined, gradually establishing a database for some 300 native woody plant species. A herbarium containing documents and specimen sheets on the flora was established, as were plant nurseries containing tens of thousands of trees, shrubs, and lianas for planting out in the forests on an annual basis. Many of these species, some extremely rare, are now well established in the Auroville greenbelt, and some have begun to produce seeds. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: By the 1980s a marked difference could be seen in the ecology of the area. A canopy of pioneer species had been established, creating shade and providing the necessary environmental conditions for the re-establishment of various indigenous plants. As the forests have grown and native flora has returned, native fauna has also begun returning to the area. The number of bird species has increased from approximately 30 to more than 90. Species of butterflies, moths, and other insects have taken advantage of the increased diversity of plant food sources, and their diversity has also increased. Many species of reptiles are present, including monitor lizards, chameleons, starbacked turtles, and star tortoises. Furthermore, up to 19 species of snakes are now considered common, including the indian spectacled cobra and Russell's viper. Mammals whose populations have increased include the mongoose (Herpestes edwarsi), black-naped hare (Lepus nigricollis), and civet cat (Viverricula indica), and porcupine (Hystrix indica) have also been sighted.

The forests of Auroville now cover over 2000 acres, and each year around 50,000 more seedlings find a nook or cranny to call home. Survival rates for these seedlings are good, now that the environment has been improved by the initial plantings.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Slowly, villagers are beginning to assimilate the impact of Auroville's action and to draw their own conclusions. Raised earth grids are appearing around their fields along with checkdams in the canyons that threaten them. Trees are now replacing some field crops. In response, Auroville provides whatever support and assistance it can in the form of training programs, techniques, seedlings, and even joint proposals for funds to restore the balance of this piece of earth we share.
Some of the reforested areas are designated as sanctuaries, while others are managed as mixed forests that in the long term will produce sustainable supplies of timber for the developing township. All of the forests are managed with a view to biodiversity conservation and wildlife protection. At present, a project to develop a system of shared forest management with the villages that are proximal to the remnant forests is being developed with the help of the European Commission. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/canada-british-columbia-restoration-in-coastal-british-columbia-riparian-forests/	Canada: British Columbia: Restoration in Coastal British Columbia Riparian Forests	Canada	1998-07-20	2002-07-20	"In the 1990s, British Columbia began an ambitious program to restore fish habitat affected by steep-slope logging and the removal of timber from stream edges. Early efforts to restore riparian stands focused on the use of vegetation to stabilize gravel bars, and the planting of long-lived conifer trees in stands dominated by red alder (an early-successional tree species that flourished in logged riparian areas). More innovative approaches were sought, and two BC forestry companies–International Forest Products Ltd. and Western Forest Products Ltd.–became involved in the testing and development of other, more effective techniques for riparian restoration. By using old forests as “ecological templates”, new silvicultural treatments were devised that mimic the passage of time and more quickly return riparian function and habitat diversity. Twelve sites were chosen in coastal British Columbia for interventions employing some of these new techniques. The measures taken at these sites included: thinning dense stands, planting under-represented species, introducing large woody debris into streams and riparian systems, and topping and girdling trees in order to diversify habitat and simulate more natural conditions. Initial post-project site monitoring has suggested that these measures were efficacious and that future restoration efforts might benefit from their utilization.Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Historically, timber harvesting has been carried out in many riparian areas. From a logging standpoint, these areas typically have large timber and are among the most accessible terrain. Many accessible riparian areas around coastal streams have been logged at some point following World War II (or earlier via selection hand logging). More stringent guidelines began to be implemented in the 1980s and onwards. Clear-cut harvesting in coastal riparian areas often results in conversion to deciduous stands on the wetter sites (typically alder, Alnus rubra, but also cottonwood, Populus balsamifera ssp trichocarpa, and bigleaf maple Acer macrophylum). These generally develop a variable and often sparse conifer understorey of western red cedar, Sitka spruce and western hemlock. The drier sites typically form dense stands of conifers, often with western hemlock as a leading species. The successional trajectory of these stands following clear-cut harvesting does not necessarily generate the lower density, structurally diverse stands that often existed pre-harvest, at least not in a timeframe that humans would consider reasonable. Coastal forests (classified as the Coastal Western Hemlock zone1) probably encompass the greatest diversity and abundance of wildlife habitat of any ecological zone in British Columbia (BC). Riparian forests – those that surround streams and rivers – are disproportionately important, as they are highly biodiverse areas that also provide animal movement corridors and fish habitat. Riparian corridors are the main productive forest areas that (depending on stream type) are reserved from harvesting in BC, both to protect salmon and trout habitat and provide for biodiversity and landscape connectivity. Typical management aims relate to stream integrity (bank stability, water quality, shade) and provision of downed trees (large woody debris) for stream channels. Large woody debris is crucial for healthy salmon and trout habitat, as it creates pools and cover, retains nutrients and stabilizes the stream. The 12 projects focused on thinning overstocked conifer stands, releasing conifers suppressed by overstorey alder, and replanting with preferred (for the site) coniferous riparian tree species. The achievement of old-forest conditions by creating stands of larger, well-spaced conifer trees was the primary objective of the projects. These treated stands will help maximize current and future habitat value; enhance structural and compositional diversity; and ensure a future source of large woody debris for the adjacent streams.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: ** Thinning Treatments **
Both alder dominated and conifer dominated sites were thinned. In all of the treatment areas, the most abundant stand type was alder dominated stands with a suppressed, scattered understorey of conifers. Understorey conifer growth was improved by removing all alder within a radius of three to ten metres of each conifer tree. Approximately 80% of the alders in the stand was removed  -  the minimum necessary to achieve a target of 40% full sunlight to the understorey trees. Post-treatment conditions depended on the site  -  alder stands with conifer understorey were thinned to 100-300 stems per hectare of overstorey alder. Pockets of pure alder were also thinned, and up to 600 stems per hectare were retained depending on the age and height of the stand.

The extent of alder stands with sparse conifer understoreys made it logical (from the perspective of promoting diversity) to thin the smaller number of conifer-dominated sites down to numbers that are still relatively high compared to ""˜old forest' conditions (e.g. 450  -  600 stems per hectare). This strategy retains higher stocking levels for later removal, in order to meet long-term goals for large woody debris and recruitment of stand structure, while leaving a wind-firm stand. These sites were thinned with the goal of improving conifer growth and establishment. Both uniform and variable density thinning was used to take advantage of productive growing sites, while allowing natural gaps and clusters of trees to prevail. These sites were typically hemlock-dominated. Where western red cedar and Sitka spruce were present, they were preferentially retained.

** Conifer Planting **
Sitka spruce and western red cedar were re-established in many thinned areas by planting, in order to increase the species and structural diversity of the riparian forests. This planting is typically done in clusters on the best available microsites. This approach also allows for easier and more effective brushing - i.e. understorey removal adjacent to the trees - until the trees become established. Plantings were made in openings created by topping and felling. Other planting sites included nurse-stumps, rotted debris piles and individually disbursed trees. Deer-browse protection was not provided.

** River Structures **
Streams adjacent to harvested stands often develop a deficiency of large woody debris  -  the fallen trees that provide channel complexity and stability. Large woody debris (LWD) is very important for maintaining quality habitat for the salmon species that use coastal BC streams. Many stream restoration projects have been undertaken to re-introduce LWD in BC. The logs used are typically coniferous species (preferred for their longevity), which are cabled into place to make effective use of scarce resources. The use of surplus trees removed from the stands during thinning in these projects was carried out as an experimental treatment - it was seen as effective and inexpensive, given that crews were already felling trees near the stream edge. Structures were made using surplus conifer and alder trees removed at streamside to release existing site conifers. Alder decays quickly, but its felling at streamside provided opportunity for short-term LWD. Trees were directionally felled to form tight ""˜self-locking' log jams of two to 17 trees. Where possible, the structures were anchored by orienting them against natural ""pinch points', such as boulders or streamside trees. Introduced ballast, cables and boulders are commonly used to anchor engineered fish-habitat structures, but were not required.

** Biodiversity **
The thinning crew and supervisors added a wide range of biodiversity features to treated stands. This involved damaging or topping trees to introduce heart rot; girdling trees to create standing ""˜snags'; creating cavities for small mammals and amphibians; and using ""˜flanges' to simulate the loose bark used by roosting bats. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Follow-up monitoring has been carried out at four sites: Keogh River, Kootowis Creek, Quatam River and Goodspeed River. Keogh River has a post-treatment history of 4.5 years, Kootowis Creek 2.75 years, Quatam River 3.25 years and Goodspeed River 2.6 years. The early post-treatment responses at these four trial sites provide valuable data regarding restoration options for ecological recovery of riparian stands.

** Thinning **
All thinned stands have a park-like, natural appearance brought on by variable thinning regimes. Uniform thinning at variable densities of 450  -  600 stems per hectare (sph) in western hemlock stands achieved 2.2  -  3.4 mm radial growth per year in stands logged in the 1940s and 1950s. Trees from these stands had decreased in diameter growth to â‰¤1 mm radial growth per year prior to treatment due to over-crowding and canopy closure. Thirty year-old Sitka spruce averaged 5.5 mm radial growth when an overstocked plantation was thinned to 600 stems per hectare. This growth was close to the average radial growth achieved by the trees in the stand prior to thinning, indicating that thinning allowed the trees to retain close to their best growth rates. At 600 sph, adequate trees are retained for removal in subsequent passes. Leaving these higher densities standing in the first pass also assists in minimizing blow-down, a considerable risk in several areas. Trees downed by wind were absent from all conifer sites. However, at Goodspeed River, two alder stands experienced moderate blow-down after thinning.

** Planting **
The best growth of planted seedlings was achieved in alder-dominated stands where 80-90% of overstorey alder was removed. Canopy removal also favoured the growth of competing brush, creating intense competition for growing space. Cluster planting (trees grouped on the best available microsites) managed brush competition for two years following planting, making it possible for seedlings to become established. However, follow-up control of brush was required for sites planted at Quatam and Goodspeed Rivers.

Seedling mortality was high for western red cedars in two trial sites. Many young planted trees were absent, browsed or significantly reduced in number, with few sites retaining more than half of the red cedar trees planted. Sitka spruce survival was high. In western hemlock stands under-planted with Sitka spruce and western red cedar, the new understorey established successfully. Height gains were not large compared to seedlings planted in alder stands where significant overstorey was removed. Leader growth in seedlings at conifer sites was 7 - 20 cm annually, compared to 2 - 2.5 times that in the more open alder sites. Good growth rates were an important objective in this project, but the successful establishment of new seedlings was more important. The height growth of seedlings at conifer sites can be improved with additional canopy removal. This may be implemented when appropriate to add more structure for biodiversity or remove trees for in-stream use.

** River Structures **
Most structures monitored remained very close to their original configuration. Several logs pulled away, but were caught on log jams created further downstream. These structures were intact despite having been in place during a 1 in 50-year return interval flood.

** Biodiversity Treatments **
Those biodiversity features that require decay to meet habitat objectives were still far too young to yield results at the time of monitoring. Some woodpecker activity was observed on one topped western hemlock, but all others were devoid of feeding activity. Trees distressed by cutting slabs of bark and wood from the stem were similarly absent of activity due to lack of time. ""Face cuts"" (removal of a slab of bark) were weather hardened with no sign of decay. Heal-over tissue along the outer edges obscured the nature of the cuts, making it difficult to distinguish them from naturally wounded trees. Girdled conifers in all stands were defoliated, leaving standing snags with excellent upper structure. All girdled and topped trees were still standing. Bat use of the many slots and flanges cut was not readily apparent. Dens cut in logs and stumps for use by mice, voles and shrews similarly lacked evidence of use. Nesting material was absent and droppings infrequent. Many of the small dens were water logged or filled with stagnant water. However, salamanders took advantage of the vacant dens and made extensive use of them. Occupancy was near 100% by western red back and clouded salamanders.
Early results show speeding restoration through silviculture can yield significant benefits. Through planting, sites devoid of conifers can be restocked, but later brush removal is needed to ensure survival. Overstorey trees that shade out desirable understorey trees can be removed, allowing existing or planted trees to thrive. Wood not needed for stand structure can be added to streams or allowed to lie on the ground to provide nourishment for soil or habitat for wildlife.
Establishing a treatment regime that best suits the wildlife needs of a site can be difficult, however. The removal of too few trees may not allow retained trees to achieve their maximum diameter growth response. Removal of too many trees may yield larger diameter trees, but too few for future use by wildlife, snag recruitment or in-stream debris. Significant effort was expended in adding wildlife habitat features to stands, but little actual use was observed. Some features fell victim to the very wet ecosystems in which they were placed; dens and cavities filled with water, making boxes cut for mice and voles more valuable for salamanders instead.
An unexpected result of the treatments was the very positive impact of girdling. Girdling was incorporated into stand treatments to remove overstorey alder for releasing understorey conifers. It was also used to leave standing structure in conifer stands in order to mitigate tree damage by wind-throw. Girdling exceeded all objectives. In conifer stands, the leafless trees provided large standing structure that gradually opened the site to light, and wind-throw was not observed in stands where girdled trees had been left in place. Girdling produced large standing structure at a fraction of the cost of manually topping trees. Although girdled trees may topple quickly, standing snags in areas where trees were formerly girdled suggest that many will decay and break, leaving natural snags similar to those manually cut by topping but at a fraction of the cost. More follow-up monitoring will be required to understand the long-term effects on the forest and any further treatments required. "

As part of the Sudeten Range shared by Poland, Germany and the Czech Republic, the Krkonoše Mountains were severely degraded by heavy industrial pollution resulting from intensified local industry under the Soviet Union. Because the damage was so extensive and the effect on ecological processes so lasting, large sections of forest have continued to decline even after the mitigation of major sources of pollution in the region. Therefore, much research and many resources have been directed at better understanding the ecology of these forested mountains and at taking decisive steps toward the conservation of their incredible biodiversity. While early attempts at restoration, through the planting of Norway spruce (Picea abies), resulted in even greater acidification of the soil, current projects are focusing on more targeted measures to protect specific plant species and enhance habitat for endangered fauna.Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry This ecologically diverse area has been seriously degraded by human activity for centuries. Logging has occurred since the Middle Ages, straining forest resources; industrial pollution in more recent times has caused deep-seated disturbance; and tourism continues to have a detrimental impact.
Intensive logging in the forests of the Krkonoše began in the 15th century. Continuing into the 17th century, intensive logging continued, and logged areas were slowly replanted with Norway spruce (Picea abies). As a result, only six percent of the original beech (Fagus sylvatica) and one percent of the original beech-fir-spruce (Fagus sylvatica; Abies alba; Picea abies) forests still exist in remnant patches in the western part of the park (Emmer et al, 1998).
Industrial pollution under the Soviet Union began in the 1950s with the advent of large-scale communist industrialization programs in Poland, the Czech Republic and East Germany. Energy-intensive industries relied on locally available high-sulfur coal, and the resulting pollution, particularly sulfur-dioxide, earned this region its distinction as the “Black Triangle.” By the early 1990’s, the ecological devastation from pollution was so severe that trees were killed over entire hillsides, and 8000 hectares of higher-altitude forests died as a result of acid deposition and related problems (i.e. insect infestation and windthrow). Furthermore, as the forest overstory began to die back, the aggressive grasses Calamagrostis villosa and Deschampsia flexuosa came to dominate the herb layer, crowding out rare species and reducing overall biodiversity (Emmer et al. 1998). In fact, 60 percent of the forests in the northern part of the Czech Republic showed signs of decline around this time. Although air pollution has decreased in the entire country by 50 percent since the 1980’s (Fronk, 1999), the residual effects of past air pollution continues to degrade soil quality and contribute to long-term forest decline (Schwarz et al, 1997).
Besides logging and pollution, the Krkonoše Mountains also face ecosystem stressors stemming from the six to eight million people who visit Krkonoše National Park each year (Goczol-Gontarek, 1996). One of the main impacts of tourism is the construction of trails, ski runs, and ski lifts to accommodate the more than 1000 kilometers of ski and hiking areas in the park. Tourists also trample vegetation, increase air pollution from automobiles, contribute to water pollution and produce solid waste. Krkonoše National Park contains a unique mosaic of habitat types, which include: alpine grasslands, subarctic peatbogs, stands of sudetic dwarf mountain pine (Pinetum mughi Sudeticum), glacial corries, flower-rich mountain meadows, and conifer and mixed forests (UNESCO, 1996 ). Many rare and endemic plants exist in the park, such as the basalt saxifraga (Saxifraga moschanta ssp. basaltica), Karkonosze bellflower (Carpanula bomemica), cloudberry (Rubus chamemorus), and arctic saxifrage (Saxifraga nivalis) (Goczol-Gontarek, 1996). In all, more than 1,250 taxa of vascular plants have been identified in Krkonoše, amounting to almost half of the Czech Republic’s original flora. Many times more taxa of non-vascular plants (sporophytes) have been identified, and inventories of these groups are undoubtedly still incomplete.
Four distinct altitudinal vegetation belts can be defined in the Krkonoše Mountains: submontane (400 to 800 m), montane (800 to 1,200 m), subalpine (1,200 to 1,450 m) and alpine (1,450 to 1,602 m).
In the submontane belt, natural deciduous and mixed forests are formed mainly by European beech (Fagus sylvatica), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), and grey alder (Alnus incana). The herb layer is characterized by vernal plants, including ramsons (Allium ursinum), tuber-hollow fumitory (Corydalis cava), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa), yellow wood anemone (A. ranunculoides), dropping bittercress (Dentaria enneaphyllos), coralwort (D.bulbifera), and Turk’s cap lily (Lilium martagon).
The montane belt consists of an herb layer dominated by ferns – alpine lady fern (Athyrium distentifolium), male fern (Dryopteris filix-mas), and hard fern (Blechnum spicant) – and graminoids, such as villous smallreed (Calamagrostis villosa) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). On damp sites, tall-herb vegetation includes hairy chervil (Chaerophyllum hirsutum), white and Kablikova’s butterburs (Petasites albus, P. kablikianus), and large bitter-cress (Cardamine amara).
The subalpine belt has a shrub layer dominated by Swiss mountain pine (Pinus mugo) and an herb layer dominated by mat-grass (Nardus stricta), villous smallreed (Calamagrostis villosa), various sedges (genus Carex), and low ericoid shrubs: bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cowberry (V.vitis-idaea), bog whortleberry (V.uliginosum), small cranberry (Oxycoccus microcarpus), and crowberry (Empetrum hermaphroditum). Endemic and relic species, such as hawkweeds (Hieracium spp.), sudetic lousewort (Pedicularis sudetica), and cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) are also abundant.
Finally, the alpine belt is home to the famous Krkonoše endemics: Sudetic rowan (Sorbus sudetica), Bohemian bellflower (Campanula bohemica), basalt musky saxifrage (Saxifraga moschata basaltica), rock burnet saxifrage (Pimpinella saxifraga rupestris), and almost thirty species of hawkweeds (genus Hieracium).
The region’s glacial cirques are home to a unique and diverse host of vegetation. The uppermost solitary summits of the Krkonoše (Snezka, Studnicni hora, Lucni hora, Vysoke Kolo, Kotel) are covered by a scanty but prominent vegetation of herbs, bryophytes, and lichens: such as three-leaved rush (Juncus trifidus), daisy-leaved speedwell (Veronica bellidioides), spiked woodrush (Luzula spicata), endemic alpine hawkweeds (Hieracium alpinum agg.), and the lichens Thamnolia vermicularis and Rhizocarpon geographicum. Cirque slopes are covered by a varying pattern of tall-herb and fern meadows, with monkshoods (Aconitum firmum, A.gracile), hedge-garlic adenostyle (Adenostyles alliariae), blue sow-thistle (Cicerbita alpina), and numerous ferns. Slope springs are home to chives (Allium sibiricum), marsh felwort (Swertia perennis), alpine bartsia (Bartsia alpina), willow-herbs (Epilobium spp.), and least primrose (Primula minima). Finally, the cirques’ bizarre crooked forests are comprised of Carpathian birch (Betula carpatica), Silesian willow (Salix silesiaca), Swiss mountain pine (Pinus mugo), rocky cherry (Padus petraea) and, rarely, the endemic Sudetic rowan (Sorbus sudetica). The current management goal is to preserve remaining biodiversity and restore the natural ecosystem.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Until recently, the Czech forest management institute, Lesproject, attempted to restore the declining forests by planting Norway spruce (Picea abies). Unfortunately, this management plan exacerbated the acidification problems caused by acid rain through borealization, or the process by which conifer needles increase the acidity of the litter, retarding decomposition and reducing nutrient cycling (Emmer et al, 1998). As the pollution-stressed conifers lost needles, the soils became even more acidic (Emmer et al 1998).

The current park management (KRNAP) changed forest restoration practices as a result of ecological research. In all four zones of the park (as established in accordance with UNESCO Biodiversity Reserve guidelines), a high priority is given to salvage management of endangered species. The plants most in danger of extinction are cultivated and then replanted in restored areas (Schwarz, 1996). A high priority is also given to planting trees that decrease the acidification of the soil, such as beech (Fagus sylvantica) (Schwartz, 1996).

Within the park zones, different restoration goals are established depending on the severity of the ecosystem damage (Schwartz, 1996). In zone one (4152 hectares) and zone two (3046 hectares), the goal is to preserve areas that are only slightly damaged and to replant damaged areas with native trees and plants. These two zones comprise the most sensitive high-altitude areas of highest biodiversity. In zones three and four (the lower elevations in the park and the buffer area outside the park), the goal is to preserve water quality, restrict land use and manage the meadow herb layer (Schwartz et al. 1997). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Restoration activities in Krkonoše National Park are the culmination of much planning and scientific research. By 1993, more than 90 research projects had been conducted in the park and its buffer zones--from air pollution monitoring to models of forest and ground-layer growth under pollution stress to management techniques for root cuttings, cloning, and herb coverage (KRNAP, 1997). Between 1992 and 1996, this ongoing work had resulted in the reforestation of over 2700 hectares of forests, or 34 percent of the damaged area (Hrebacka, 1997). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: See Strategies for Long-term Management
The park management can improve the restoration program by critically analyzing the restoration success, amending the soil, improving relations with the local citizens and diversifying funding sources.
The results of the restoration efforts are not systematically evaluated. For example, during the winter of 1995 and 1996 a large number of trees died on both the Czech and German sides of the mountains (CTK, 1997), yet this is not noted in the park management documents. A critical analysis of the success and failure of the plantings needs to be completed to guide restoration in the park and other similar Eastern European parks.
The park administration can also improve the restoration success by concentrating on soil restoration. Acid rain is not as acute as prior to 1990, and it is unlikely that the type of unconstrained emissions will increase again in the area, due to the change in governments in the early 1990’s. However, the soil has been so acidified that the natural regeneration of forests may not be possible within a reasonable timeframe without significant soil amendments, donor soils or intensive soil management. Although the park management does promote the planting of trees that will improve soil quality, there is a lack of published information on other ways to improve soil processes.
Furthermore, the project will not succeed in the long term without support from the local citizens. Problems between the local authorities and park administration are apparent. For example, in 1995 the park administration was not able to establish a Council of KRNAP, as required by FACE funding. The council requires four of five representatives from local towns, and the local authorities were not interested in joining (Hrebacka, 1996). A disagreement over the construction of a ski resort cable car in 1994 divided the local citizens and soured opinions of the park management. Overcoming these disagreements and cultivating local support is crucial for long term success of the restoration projects.
Finally, funding sources need to be diversified. Although the ecosystem problems in the park are due to international pollution problems and it makes sense to have international funding to complete the restoration. However, a relying on international funding can prove problematic in the future when funding may not be available. The park management should look at additional ways to diversify the funding for ecosystem restoration and monitoring. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/finland-forest-conservation-and-restoration-under-the-metso-programme/	Finland: Forest Conservation and Restoration under the METSO Programme	Finland	2002-10-17	2007-12-17	"In October 2002, the Government of Finland approved the Forest Biodiversity Programme for Southern Finland (METSO). METSO was designed as a land management strategy that would bring important tracts of privately held forest into a national conservation framework. Unlike previous conservation programmes that lacked provisions for interfacing with landowners, and thus failed to protect important areas, METSO centers around close cooperation with forest owners and allows programme managers to tailor a conservation strategy that suits the particular circumstances of a given owner, while simultaneously contributing to larger programme goals. Besides measures to address private land issues, METSO also encompasses the Forest Life project, an initiative implemented in association with the European Union’s Life-Nature programme and managed by the Finnish forestry division MetsÁ¤hallitus. Forest Life has worked to restore and protect 33 nature conservation areas from Southern Finland to Lapland, and outcomes have been favorable to this point. Ultimately, restoration activities are expected to directly benefit more than 33,000 hectares, and partnerships with property owners many more.Agriculture & Livestock, Mining & Resource Extraction Almost every area of forest in Southern Finland has at some time in the past been exploited for timber, tar-making or shifting cultivation, and many areas with nutrient-rich soils have been permanently cleared to create fields. Therefore, although the region is still largely covered by forest, few areas are preserved in a completely natural state. Fire suppression as a forest management practice has also had a detrimental impact on Finland’s forest ecosystems, as species adapted to the special environment created by periodic fires are in danger of disappearing. In all, Finland has about thirty indigenous tree species. The softwood species include: Pine (Pinus sylvestris), Spruce (Picea abies), Common Juniper (Juniperus communis), and Common or European or English Yew (Taxus baccata). The hardwood species include: Silver Birch (Betula pendula), Downy Birch (Betula pubescens), Common or European Alder (Alnus glutinosa), Grey Alder (Alnus incana), Aspen (Populus tremula), Rowan (Rosaceae), European Mountain Ash (Sorbus aucuparia), Oaklef Mountain Ash (Sorbus hybrida), Swedish Whitebeam (Sorbus intermedia), Teodori Rowan (Sorbys teodori), European Bird Cherry (Prunus padus), Littleleaf Linden (Tilia cordata), Norway Maple(Acer platanoides), Common or English or Pedunculate Oak (Quercus robur), Common or European Ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Wych Elm (Ulmus glabra), European White Elm (Ulmus laevis), Crab Apple (Malus sylvestris), Common Buckthorn (Rhamnus catharticus), Alder or Glossy Buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula), Hawnthorn (Crataegus monogyna), Goat Willow (Salix caprea), Bay or Laurel Willow (Salix pentandra), Black Maul or Almond-leaved Willow (Salix triandra), and Dark-leaved Willow (Salix myrsinifolia).
Important faunal species in the Finnish forests are: Brown Bear (Ursus arctos), Grey Wolf (Canis lupus), Elk (Alces alces), Arctic Fox (Alopex lagopus), Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), Gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), White-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos), Flat Bark Beetle (Cucujus cinnaberinus), Speckled Grasshopper (Bryodema tuberculatum), Baton Blue (Scolitantides vicrama), Silver-spotted Skipper (Hesperia comma ssp. catena), and Lesser White-fronted Goose (Anser erythropus ) in the Northern Lapland. The METSO Programme aims to preserve valuable forest habitats, while, at the same time, allowing forests to be commercially utilised for the benefit of rural economies and livelihoods. It is hoped that this approach will help promote sustainable development in rural regions of Finland.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The compulsory protection of extensive areas of privately owned forest would be prohibitively expensive and unpopular. Therefore, the METSO Programme has placed particular emphasis on working closely with landowners and maintaining an open, transparent decision-making process that ensures public participation at every level. Consequently, landowners and other interest groups, such as forest industry representatives, forestry workers’ associations and environmental organizations, have all been actively involved in the planning and implementation of the programme.

Description of Project Activities: METSO is an ambitious programme designed to ensure the conservation, protection and restoration of important ecosystems throughout Finland. Due to the nature of land ownership there, programme planners have had to devise a number of management strategies to suit particular circumstances. Much of the nation's forests (more than two-thirds) are privately owned, and collaboration and liaising with property owners has been an important means of fostering long-term conservation.

A number of projects have been developed to encourage the cooperation and participation of these landowners. Natural values trading, for instance, is a programme that allows owners to sign a contract promising to maintain and/or enhance valuable natural features of their forests over a certain period in exchange for monetary compensation. Competitive tendering is another programme whereby owners rent or sell ecologically valuable sections of their forests to the government for conservation. Another project, known as forest biodiversity cooperation networks, was designed to encourage dialogue, idea sharing and partnerships among landowners, local environmental and forest authorities, and other interest groups. Finally, nature management areas, although not yet widely instituted, will be established in sections of privately held forest with high ecological value, and land use will be carefully planned to ensure future conservation and protection.

In cases where important sites are publicly owned, restoration activities have been conducted through a METSO sub-programme, the Forest Life project. Thirty-three nature conservation areas have been targeted for restoration, based on their potential to expand or unite separate bodies of forest or mire that are in a natural-like state. Specific restoration activities have been tailored to the different ecosystems represented. 

Forested sites have been restored by conducting controlled burns, promoting the structural diversity of forests through the creation of small clearings, and increasing the amount of dead and decaying wood by damaging trees. 

Forest-covered mires are being restored through the re-creation of natural hydrology by damming and obstructing drainage ditches. Ditches are blocked with peat from the banks, and in several cases, dams have been constructed with wood, mineral soil, or rocks. In some mires, trees are also felled in order to create a more open landscape structure and help prevent evaporation.

In esker forests, degradation has resulted mainly from fire suppression and resultant overgrowth. Consequently, restoration involves creating small clearings, conducting controlled burns to imitate a forest fire, and increasing the amount of decaying wood.

Habitat for the white-backed woodpecker, a critically endangered species in Finland, has also been a major focus of restoration, as the decrease in old deciduous forests with large amounts of dead wood is threatening its survival further. The maintenance of forests inhabited by white-backed woodpeckers consists partially of the same methods used in forest restoration: creating small clearings and increasing the amount of dead and decaying wood by felling trees, damaging standing trees and clearing. When the forests in question are groves, the stacking and removal of clearing waste is necessary, as this waste consists mainly of spruce needles that acidify the soil.

Lastly, road surfaces have been reforested in some cases in order to rejoin sections of forest and discourage motor vehicle traffic that might disturb the nesting of birds. Excavators are used to loosen the soil on the roadbed and facilitate the germination of seeds and recolonization of saplings. Saplings growing on or near the banks of the road can be relocated directly on the road track, further accelerating the recovery process. In areas with rocky terrain, an excavator is used to move large rocks onto the road track, enhancing the aesthetic quality of the site. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Actions taken under the METSO Programme have directly contributed to the restoration of the following:
 -  5108 hectares of forest, at 31 sites (289 hectares by controlled burning, 2310 hectares by increasing the amount of decaying wood, and 2509 hectares by creating small clearings) 
 -  339 hectares of forest-covered mires, at 10 sites 
 -  513 hectares of esker forest, at one site 
 -  178 hectares of forest inhabited by white-backed woodpeckers, at 3 sites

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The restoration work conducted under this programme has provided valuable opportunities for employees of the MetsÁ¤hallitus Forestry Division. Theoretical and practical training in restoration has been organised in several different places throughout Finland. In the winter of 2003, lectures were held in four towns in southern Finland, and 180 people took part in this training. About 300 forest workers and other employees took part in the actual field training. Thus, employees are afforded the chance to learn new skills and become involved in a long-term national programme from the outset.
The METSO Programme has successfully created a new approach with regard to forest conservation, and expanded the variety of tools available for safeguarding forest biodiversity. The network of forests under some form of protection in Southern Finland can be considerably extended into privately owned forests thanks to measures within METSO. But it remains clear that a representative network of protected forests can only be built up with involvement from all types of forest owners, especially the State, municipalities, forest industry companies and other major owners. Many of the sites included in conservation programmes–privately-owned protected areas, sites protected under the Forest Act, and sites covered by pilot projects within the METSO Programme–are small in size. Even within protected areas, ecologically valuable biotopes may be separated from other sites with similar habitat, and this presents a problem, especially for threatened species. A comprehensive assessment is needed to facilitate the establishment of a more extensive and interlinked network of protected areas. Within the METSO region, very little consideration has thus far been to systematic landscape ecological planning at a scale greater than forest ownership boundaries. The “˜ecosystem approach’, which comprehensively examines natural processes and resource use practices over a large area, would help facilitate the effective establishment of broad conservation networks. In planning these networks, more attention should be given in the future to the need for preserving genetic diversity within species, since this may considerably improve the prospects for the preservation of their populations, particularly considering the possible impacts of climate change.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/belize-restoration-in-the-mountain-pine-ridge-forest-reserve/	Belize: Restoration in the Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve	Belize	2002-01-16	2002-01-16	"The Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve in the Cayo District of south-central Belize is unique for its mountain terrain, ancient forests, dense Caribbean pines, giant ferns, granite outcroppings, tumbling waterfalls, huge limestone caves, and open savanna grasslands–all bordered by lush tropical rainforest. An attack by the southern pine bark beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis) has placed the reserve’s endemic Caribbean pine (Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis) at risk, as more than 80% of the trees have been damaged, making viable seeds scarcely available. In response to the threat facing this forest, the Government of Belize, in partnership with professionals, organizations and governments from around the world, has developed an ambitious long-term management plan for the restoration of this important ecosystem. Conceived as both a restoration and carbon sequestration effort, the project will be funded through the sale of carbon credits to commercial investors. Due to the paucity of available seeds, project activities to this point have centered on rearing and conditioning Caribbean pine seedlings in the project’s nursery, and then planting them at degraded sites via a crew of local villagers. In 2002 alone, 3.5 million seedlings were planted over 10,000 acres with favorable results to date. The ultimate goal is the restoration of at least 90,000 acres of degraded forest.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Natural regeneration of the endemic Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis has been prevented by a serious attack of the southern pine bark beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis). Over 80% of the pine trees are dead or dying, and a significant amount of habitat is at risk of being lost, displacing much of the endemic wildlife. Collateral threats include soil erosion, desertification, siltation in the watershed, and effluence into the barrier reefs. Various unusual bird species can be found in the Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve, including the rare orange breasted falcon, stygian owl, white king vulture, oscillated turkey, acorn woodpecker, blue crown mot mot, keel billed toucan, and red-lored parrot. The reserve is also home to pumas, jaguars, the endangered ocelot, coatimundi, and the Baird’s tapir, Belize’s national animal. The reserve falls within the range of the endemic frog Rana juliani–restricted to the Maya Mountains–and a second endemic frog species, Eleutherodactylus sandersoni, is reported along with an endemic fish species, Poecilia teresae–known from the upper reaches of Belize River, the Macal and Raspaculo. The management plan aims in particular to suppress additional pine beetle attacks, control forest fires, protect wildlife habitat, and enhance soil and water quality. Over a 55-year period the project aims to produce a total carbon benefit of 48 million tones of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Seeds collected in the Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve are being tested for vigour and used to grow seedlings in a nursery. The nursery environment protects the seedlings from southern pine bark beetles. Over one hundred people are employed to plant seedlings from the nursery. Thinning activities will continue up to thirty years after the planting has been completed. It is hoped that this silvicultural treatment will prevent the return of stressful conditions that enabled the establishment of high densities of southern pine bark beetles. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Planting began in 2002, and Silviculture Belize planted 3.5 million seedlings over 10,000 acres (40kmÂ²) by the end of the year. After 3 months, many seedlings were 2 to 3 times their starting height. Mortality has been less than 1% over most of the area, and this success is attributed to the conditioning of the seedlings in the nursery and the careful planting.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The project generates employment for 800 people, and according to Forest Securities, is the single biggest employer in the region. Local Mayan people are employed by the project and are transported to and from their homes each day in order to maintain family life. Social security payments are made for each employee.
The sale of “carbon credits” may be a valuable financial tool in the conservation of native habitats. Maintaining or developing an ecosystem resilient enough to withstand changes in the populations of pathogens, such as the southern pine bark beetle, is vital to the long-term stability of the ecosystem.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/mexico-chiapas-community-based-forest-restoration-as-a-strategy-for-sequestering-carbon/	Mexico: Chiapas: Community-Based Forest Restoration as a Strategy for Sequestering Carbon	Mexico	1996-07-16	1996-07-16	"Started in 1996 as the original Plan Vivo project, Scolel té (“the tree that grows” in the Tzeltal and Tojolobal Mayan dialects) pays members of rural communities in the Mexican state of Chiapas to plant trees and restore stands of forest in order to create carbon sinks that offset some of the gases causing global climate change. Farmers decide what species to plant and where to plant them, and then they make a proposal–in the form of a Plan Vivo (or “working plan”)–to project managers. Once approved, their plan entitles them to funding from the Scolel té Trust Fund to cover the cost of supplies; and they also receive technical assistance for baseline monitoring, planting, and follow-up monitoring. Companies, individuals or institutions wishing to offset greenhouse gas emissions can then purchase voluntary emission reductions (VERs) via the Trust Fund, the Fondo BioClimatico. A percentage of the proceeds from these sales goes directly to the participating farmers.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Mining & Resource Extraction Over the past 20 years, the population of rural Chiapas has grown by 4 per cent a year, due in part to rapid immigration, and this has put tremendous pressure on the region’s natural resources. In the highlands, forests have suffered from timber extraction, charcoal burning, and overgrazing; while large areas of tropical forest in the lowlands have been cleared to make way for cattle pastures. Land degradation and a scarcity of forest products are now causing serious hardship for many communities. The objective of the Scolel té project is to reliably sequester carbon through socially and environmentally responsible forest and agricultural systems that also provide sustainable livelihoods for rural communities. Another hope of project planners is that the economic benefits afforded to local participants will reduce migration from the project areas to the Lacandon “agriculture-forest frontier,” thereby helping to protect intact stands of forest from encroachment.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Scolel té forestry activities are planned and undertaken by groups and communities of small farmers affiliated with local organizations such as the Unión de Crédito Pajal (a rural agricultural credit union) and The Mexican Association for Rural and Urban Transformation (AMEXTRA).

Description of Project Activities: Farmers who wish to participate in the project must first draw up a management plan, called a Plan Vivo. In this plan, they decide what trees to plant and where to plant them, and they agree to make ""reasonable efforts"" to ensure that the systems they establish will last for 100 years. These plans are then assessed by project managers for technical feasibility, social and environmental impact, and carbon sequestration potential; and they are compared against a number of technical specifications that have already been determined with input from scientists, farmers, and technicians. Once deemed viable, plans are registered with the project's Trust Fund and are eligible to generate carbon services. 

The Trust Fund provides farmers with financial and technical assistance to implement farm developments or community-scale forestry and agroforestry measures, on the basis of the carbon that will likely be sequestered. Individual farmers or forest user groups receive a 140 US$/ha planting grant in year zero and an annuity of US$ 70 for 18 years, from year 1. Technical assistance is provided in the planning and design of forestry and agroforestry systems, the construction of nurseries and propagation facilities, the collection of seeds, and the organization of activities. Baseline studies are conducted around the time of planting, and periodic monitoring continues for up to 18 years. 

Native pines (Pinus oocarpa) are favoured for plantation in the uplands, and cedars (Juniperus lusitanica) in the lowlands. Frequently, farmers plant maize and food crops under the trees until the canopy closes over. Some farmers are now planting avocado, mango and other fruit trees, in addition to those species that will eventually yield saleable timber. It has been estimated that tree plantations established on pastureland will increase carbon storage by approximately 120 tones per hectare. Similarly, those agro-forestry projects that intersperse timber and fruit trees with annual and perennial crops sequester about 70 tones per hectare. The full restoration of degraded forests can increase storage by about 120 tones per hectare, while the protection of threatened forests can prevent emissions of up to 300 tones per hectare. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Thus far, more than 700 individuals in 40 communities have signed up to participate in the project, and over 700 hectares of trees have been planted.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: This project is about more than planting trees. Scolel té is simultaneously helping to restore a degraded environment and improve the quality of life for Mayan villagers. In Yaluma, for example, farmers are planting pines on denuded hillsides. Already, they say, the trees are helping to reduce erosion and improve the soil. As much as 60% of carbon revenues from intercropped systems and enriched fallows have gone directly to farmers and have been used by them to cover establishment costs, to purchase food and medicines, and to improve their houses (Tipper, forthcoming; Nigel Asquith, unpublished data). The farmers believe the plantations will eventually provide them a steady supply of saleable timber, as well as fruit, medical plants and modest quantities of fuelwood. This should help to take pressure off of existing forests and thereby help preserve biodiversity in the region.
Under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, governments and polluting companies in the developed world can achieve emission reductions by funding certain types of afforestation and reforestation schemes in the developing world. The instrument for this, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), has been hugely contentious, not least because many fear that such schemes could lead to the loss of natural forest and benefit large plantation companies rather than small farmers. However, small-scale projects like Scolel té show that it is possible to contribute to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol in a way that delivers environmental benefits and at the same time, improves local livelihoods.
The Plan Vivo system pioneered in Chiapas is currently being tested in southern India and Mozambique. Evidence suggests that active carbon-trading systems can be established on a small scale and function with relatively few resources. The Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Management, joint managers of Scolel té, believes that the participatory approach has meant that farmers and communities who have signed up to join the project have devoted much more effort to planning their activities than was the case with previous state-funded forestry schemes.

The project is aimed at restoring a major tropical dry forest ecosystem that has been severely degraded as a result of anthropogenic fires associated with farming and ranching activities. These fires damage indigenous tree species that evolved in an ecosystem devoid of natural fire, and they also enable the invasive African grass jaragua (Hyparrhenia rufa) to aggressively colonize burned areas and effectively out-compete native species. Since its inception in 1986, the restoration program has sought to eliminate all fires within ACG boundaries and to facilitate the natural reforestation of denuded areas via seedling recruitment from adjacent stands of pristine forest. Although the process of recovery has been slow, former pasturelands are gradually being re-colonized by native species, and the aggressive measures taken to eliminate fires have proven successful. In 1999, the ACG was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site representing the best dry forest habitats from Central America to northern Mexico.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) Five centuries ago, there were more than 200,000 square miles of tropical dry forest on the Central American Pacific coastal lowlands from Panama to Central Mexico. Today, only 0.1% of the original dry forest remaining has conservation status, making it the most threatened of all the major lowland tropical forest habitats (Janzen 1988b). The endangered condition of Mesoamerican tropical forests is primarily the result of centuries of logging, farming, and ranching (Tenenbaum 1994), although climate change, pesticide runoff from adjacent agricultural lands, and recreational user pressure have also been contributing factors.
The use of fire by local farmers and ranchers to clear new lands for agriculture and manage existing pasturelands has been especially harmful to the forest ecosystem. Because there is no lightning during the dry season in Guanacaste province, and thus no natural fires, indigenous trees lack the thick, protective bark common in other ecosystems and are vulnerable to damage from these anthropogenic fires. Moreover, native species cannot effectively compete against the invasive grass jaragua (Hyparrhenia rufa) that aggressively colonizes burned areas, and its pervasiveness results in more fuel for the next year’s fires. The ACG is home to approximately 230,000 species (65% of the estimated number of species in Costa Rica and 2.4% of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity). By 1995, this figure was believed to include 960 species of vertebrates (including 253 species of birds and 155 species of mammals, at least half of which are bats), more than 7,000 species of plants, and more than 8,000 species of butterflies and moths, all packed into an area the size of New York City and its suburbs. The project’s two primary goals are to set in place the full-scale restoration of an entire dry tropical forest ecosystem and to ensure that wildland biodiversity of the Guanacaste Conservation Area survives into the indefinite future by involving local community members and integrating the project area into local, national and international society through sustainable use practices.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Restoration activities at the Guanacaste Conservation Area have focused on stopping all anthropogenic fires and all harvesting of plants and animals; purchasing adjacent farm and ranchland to create one large, solid unit; and facilitating natural re-colonization in degraded areas.

The fire control plan aims to prevent the expansion of the invasive African jaragua grass and to allow ""tree invasion"" into pasturelands via seeds dispersed by animals and the wind (Whelan 1987). Project planners have hired a small staff dedicated solely to fire elimination and have allocated funds for vehicles and other tools that allow for the prompt extinguishment of any new fires. Park staff clears fire breaks, maintains fire-access roads, and mans an observation station around-the-clock throughout the six-month fire season. In the early years of the program, cattle were also used as biotic mowing machines to thin the jaragua, and thereby reduce the amount of available fuel. They are no longer used, however, as the other prevention strategies have proven effective.

With adequate fire protection to control the jaragua, a forest can move several hundred meters into an old pasture within ten years, simply as a result of seed dispersal (Whelan 1987). The first seeds brought into an abandoned pasture are generally wind-dispersed seeds from the forest's edge. Of the 215 tree species at Santa Rosa National Park, 25% have wind-dispersed seeds and are effective pioneer species. In an area of Santa Rosa last affected by fire in 1979, twelve species of trees constituted at least 90% of the vegetative cover in 1986. The wind-dispersed species in the plot were representatives of the families: Leguminosae, Boraginaceae, Verbenaceae, Tilaceae, Meliaceae, Bignoniaceae, Cochlospermaceae, and Hippocrateaceae (Janzen 1988a). Most of the wind-dispersed initial colonizers are large trees (attaining heights of 15-25 m) and live for 50 to several hundred years (Janzen 1988a). 

Along with trees encroaching into pastureland from the forest's edge, an isolated tree may appear in the middle of a pasture from dung dropped by a cow or horse while grazing the field (Whelan 1987). In cases such as this, the solitary tree, called a nuclear tree, acts as an island that begins to grow into the surrounding pasture. When the tree gets large enough to provide shade for domestic grazing animals and habitat for birds, it attracts seed dispersing animals that bring the second wave of seeds. The forest island that springs up around this tree may eventually reclaim the pastureland and join the native forest (Whelan 1987). 

In the early years of the program, some experimental tree planting occurred, but was quickly abandoned as a waste of energy and scarce resources. However, in the moister eastern end of the ACG, it has become clear that natural rainforest invasion is extremely slow. Here, it has been shown that a single unmanaged 4-8 year rotation of a gmelina plantation is extremely effective in eliminating many kinds of deep pasture grasses and allowing a young natural rainforest to colonise the site (e.g. http://janzen.sas.upenn.edu/RR/rincon_rainforest.htm). While this is expensive (about $300/ha) and should not be used where there is still intact forest to be purchased for inclusion in the larger conservation area, it is a very fast form of pasture elimination in sites where forest closure is important, such as narrowing the gap between two forest blocks.

Besides focusing on fire suppression and vegetative succession, program planners have also purchased tracts of land adjacent to the park in order to augment the extension of protected habitat.  When it became clear in the late 1990's that, in order to save the Guanacaste dry forest, a large area of intact adjacent rainforest was necessary, a fund-raising campaign was initiated to expand 5,500+ hectares to the east. This initiative took the ACG up to the developed agroscape and helped ensure the rescue of all remaining adjacent rainforest simply by purchasing it (http://janzen.sas.upenn.edu/RR/rincon_rainforest.htm). There are perhaps another 10,000 hectares of forest remnants remaining at other points on the park's boundaries, and it is hoped that these can also be obtained. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: All fires have been eliminated in the ACG, and approximately 70,000 ha of ancient fields and pastures are now covered with young regenerating dry forest. Areas that have been protected from fire for ten years now have ten- to fifteen-foot-tall trees living where there was once just pasture. Within 200 years, the entire dry forest ecosystem and its adjacent wet areas will appear to be fully recovered. Within one half of a millennium the area should be indistinguishable from the original forest, except for those changes that are inevitable through climate change and the insular nature of the conservation area within its surrounding agroscape. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: In a study by Gerhardt (1998), the major cause of seedling mortality in a tropical dry forest was defoliation during dry-season drought.
Restoration of a large tropical wildland by eliminating destructive agents and allowing natural re-invasion of the biota is not only the least expensive possible method, it allows both funds and human resources to be directed at the more complex, challenging and critical process of biodiversity development on the site. The ACG is one of several viable protocols for the conservation of large wildland areas in tropical countries (and in some circumstances, extra-tropical ones as well). The biological and sociological processes that have worked well in the ACG contain many elements that could be applied successfully in other contexts, although they would have to be tailored to the particular circumstances affecting restoration at a given site. Building the project into the framework of the local and national community, and concentrating on ecological and economic sustainability, is essential. The ACG employs only Costa Ricans and promotes from within the ACG staff in order to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility for the project among the employees and neighbouring communities. Most personnel development is through on-the-job training. The strategy of the ACG has been to fully involve the resident community in the forest’s development and products, and to make the ACG a local source of revenue, pride and intellectual development. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/tanzania-forest-restoration-in-the-shinyanga-region/	Tanzania: Forest Restoration in the Shinyanga Region	Tanzania	1986-07-12	1986-07-12	"In 1986, the government of Tanzania launched the Shinyanga Soil Conservation Programme (HASHI) with the aim of restoring severely degraded woodlands in the Shinyanga Region and providing local villagers access to important natural resources. Under this programme, the ngitili, a traditional resource management system, is being employed as the engine for remediation. Ngitilis are carefully managed tracts of land, held individually or communally, that are excluded from grazing during the wet season and then used for fodder at the peak of the dry season. The ngitili has been found to represent an easily instituted and highly effective means of investing villagers in the long-term goals of restoration and conservation and ensuring the cooperation of village institutions at all levels of planning and implementation. Since the inception of the programme, more than 350,000 hectares have been converted into ngitilis, and once-degraded forest lands are slowly being restored, while still providing subsistence to the villagers that depend on them.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation Shinyanga region used to be covered with dense acacia scrub and miombo woodland, but by 1985 much of the landscape had been transformed into an open-bush savanna. During the 1920s and 1930s, large areas of land were cleared of bush and trees as part of a tse tse fly and quelea quelea bird eradication programme (HASHI-ICRAF, 1997). Deforestation and bush clearing continued as large blocks of land were converted into fields for the production of cash crops like cotton and rice. Overgrazing became a serious problem as the area of rangeland declined, and matters were made worse in 1975 when many people from traditional villages were relocated to newly created settlements under the government’s Villagization Act. The programme’s aim was to bring rural families closer to social services, but it meant the abandonment of houses, farms and – most significantly – their ngitilis. The Sukuma have long relied on these enclosures (“ngitilis”) of acacia-miombo woodlands to provide them with dry-season fodder for their cattle, as well as firewood and other essential products. But by 1985 this traditional system of land management had virtually disappeared, and a mere 1,000 hectares of ngitilis remained. Natural vegetation was originally woodland and bushland, with species such as Acacia, Brachystegia, Albizia, Commiphora and Dalbergia (HASHI-ICRAF, 1997). The miombo woodlands of Shinyanga are currently dominated by Brachystegia, Julbernardia and Isoberlinia species. Other important species are Combretum collinum, Baikea spp., Lonchocarpus capasa, Azanza garkeana, Albizia spp. and Dalbergia melanoxylon. Acacia woodlands consist mostly of Acacia tortilis, A. nilotica and A. polyacantha, while other important species in this agropastoral land include Adansonia digitata and Tamarindus indica (Kamwenda, 1999). To improve natural resource management and facilitate the recovery of degraded forest lands in the Shinyanga Region through the revitalization of the traditional ngitili system.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Early attempts at reforestation in Shinyanga, involving compulsory destocking and conventional tree planting schemes, relying mostly on exotic species, had failed to stem the loss of indigenous woodland. Therefore, when field officers launched the Shinyanga Soil Conservation Programme (HASHI) in 1985, they sought the advice of local community members. These community members suggested that restoring the old ngitilis should be made a priority.

Description of Project Activities: The ngitili system was developed by villagers as a means of ensuring dry-season fodder reserves by carefully managing an area of standing vegetation (i.e. grasses, trees, shrubs and forbs) from the onset to the end of the rainy season. These areas remain closed to livestock during the wet season and are then opened for grazing at the peak of dry season.

Ngitili areas are traditionally established on degraded land and around homesteads. They vary in size from 0.2 to 20ha for private ones to 50ha for communal ngitili (Maro, 1995). The boundaries are usually not rigidly marked, and physical barriers are not established, but ownership rights are well respected. The ngitili are protected via by-laws enforced by the local guards (sungusungu), and offenders must pay penalties. The site selection for ngitili establishment is influenced by land availability, proximity to homesteads and ease of protection. Initial siting of the area is the responsibility of the household head. In the case of private or communal ngitili, a group of elders becomes responsible (Kilahama, 1994a). The potential sites are demarcated at the beginning of the wet season. Once the ngitili are demarcated and closed for protection, very little or no management is required during the rainy season.

Grazing starts in July or August, at the peak of the dry season, after the crop residues and fallow vegetation have been depleted. The most common system involves temporary demarcation of paddocks for specific periods. Upon the completion of fodder on a particular paddock, animals are moved to a fresh paddock. The demarcation of paddocks and the movement of animals between them is controlled by experienced elders, who make management decisions on the basis of specific indicators such as the utilization level and the availability of fodder. The Wasukuma over the years have developed systematic management practices for ngitili. Management is aimed at optimizing fodder and thatch grass production and growth of other vegetation species, hence improving biodiversity. Large trees which would possibly deter grass growth are deliberately removed, while fodder trees are protected. Most of the trees that now exist in ngitili are believed to influence grass production and the general fodder situation (Kilahama, 1994b).

Before HASHI could actually begin reviving the ngitili system, its first task was to raise awareness about the importance of restoring degraded landscapes. This was accomplished using video, theatre, newsletters and other media. Although some farmers remembered how to manage ngitilis, many didn't; so the project also had to provide technical training. Farmers were shown which native species to choose for planting and restoration, how to select the right site for their ngitilis and how to manage them. Besides advising individual farmers, HASHI worked closely with village governments and environmental committees, as well as with traditional institutions such as the dagashida, the community assemblies that lay down customary law and punish those who break it. HASHI also worked with village law enforcement and two traditional law enforcement institutions, the sungusungu or traditional guards, which are now part of the village security committee, and the dagshida, to ensure effective administration and oversight of the new ngitilis.

In many villages, HASHI field officers used residual natural seed and root stock to restore ngitili enclosures. In others, active tree planting (first of exotic species, later of the indigenous tree species preferred by local people) was carried out, especially around homesteads. Some of the restored ngitili dated back to pre-villagization days; others were newly created by farmers and villages. In addition to restoring ngitili, villagers were encouraged to plant trees around homesteads (particularly fruit and shade trees), field boundaries, and farm perimeters. This helped improve soil fertility and provide firewood, and had the side benefit of helping farmers to stake out and formalize their land rights within villages (Barrow 2005c). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: In the early years, restoration efforts proceeded gradually, as cautious farmers and communities assessed the benefits and rights which ngitili regeneration produced. By the early 1990s, however, with the project's effectiveness beyond doubt, restoration efforts spread rapidly through the region. In 1986, only about 600 hectares of documented ngitili enclosures existed in Shinyanga. A survey of 172 sample villages in the late 1990s revealed 18,607 ngitili (284 communal and the rest owned by households) covering roughly 78,122 hectares (Kaale et al. 2003:8, Barrow and Mlenge 2004:1). Extrapolating from these figures, project managers estimate that more than 350,000 hectares in Shinyanga are in use as ngitili, with nine out of ten inhabitants of Shinyanga's 833 villages enjoying access to ngitili goods and services (Barrow 2005b).

The case of Wigelekeko village, in the Maswa District of Shinyanga, demonstrates the implications of these new ngitilis for rural livelihoods and forest restoration. The village had suffered for years from shortages of animal fodder, wood products and water during the dry season. In 1986, with help from HASHI, the villagers set aside 160 hectares of severely degraded land as a ngitili. Domestic livestock were excluded from this area, and the natural vegetation was given time to recover. Five years later, the area was covered with dense scrub. Carefully controlled collection of firewood, thatching grass, medicinal plants and other forest products began in 1991. And then the water began to flow. A well that used to be empty in the dry season is now full throughout the year. Convinced that their efforts had increased the water supply, the villagers added another 20 hectares to the ngitili in 1997. Each family also contributed financially to the construction of a dam, which was filled with water from the ngitili. The villagers were even able to begin fishing, and the dam now provides water for almost 2000 cattle, with a surplus to sell to outsiders. 

The ngitili forests were surveyed in 2004-2005, and a total of 152 different species of trees, shrubs and climbers were identified. There are variations in species composition between the districts, but two major vegetation types were distinguished, namely: Bushland (Acacia, Dalbergia , and Combretum bushlands) in Shinyanga Urban, Meatu, Bariadi and Maswa districts (eastern side of the region); and regrowth miombo woodland in Kahama, Shinyanga Rural and Bukombe districts (western side of the region). Generally, the regrowth miombo vegetation had higher stocking, basal area, volume production, and tree species diversity compared to the bushland.

Regeneration in the ngitilis was largely through coppice regrowth and root suckers, rather than through seeds. Regenerants are generally few, and the two most regenerating species, Dichrostachys cinerea and Omorcapum trichocarpum, are indicators of degraded areas. Grass and herb cover is also generally low and is dominated by grass species, which is another indicator of degraded sites. The dominant tree species in terms of volume per hectare in the surveyed ngitili are: Acacia tortilis, Acacia tanganyikensis, Acacia senegal, Acacia mellifera, Acacia kirkii, Acacia seyal var. fistula, Acacia drepanolobium, Acacia sieberiana, and Acacia polyacantha. Non-Acacia species included: Commiphora africana, Dalbergia melanoxylon, Combretum zeyheri, Cordia sinensis, Pterocarpus angolensis, Diplorhynchus condylocarpon and Albizia harveyi. Individual ngitili are well defined and of better quality in terms of wood stocking and tree species diversity when compared to communal ngitili.

Many species of birds and small- to medium-sized mammals have emerged after the introduction of the ngitili. Birds, mostly seed and insect eaters, have easily recolonised habitats that were once destroyed. There are 41 bird species with restricted ranges in Tanzania and seven of these species are found in the Shinyanga Region and its immediate environs. Bird species with restricted range in Shinyanga and its environs are Grey-breasted Spur fowl, Fischers Love Bird, Usambiro Barbet, Grey-chrested Helmet-Shrike, Rufous tailed Weaver and Steaky seed- eater. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: There are not clear indications that the restoration is sustainable. Concerns have arisen due to the fact that both human and livestock populations are rapidly increasing, and there has been a surge in the demand for biodiversity resources from the recovering landscape.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Armed with this powerful combination of traditional and scientific knowledge, villages across Shinyanga gradually revitalized the institution of ngitili and have broadened its use from simple soil and fodder conservation to production of a wide range of woodland goods and services. Products such as timber, fodder, fuelwood, medicinal herbs, wild fruits, honey, and edible insects have enhanced livelihoods and provided a vital safety net during dry seasons and droughts (Barrow and Mlenge 2003:1). The total monthly value of benefits from ngitilis per person in Shinyanga Region is estimated at Tsh. 14,046 (USD 14.0). This is higher than the national average consumption per person of Tsh. 8,500 (USD 8.5) per month in the rural areas of Tanzania.
Experience in Shinyanga illustrates the importance of working with local people. In the past, the state imposed its own solutions, which often failed. The survival rate of trees planted in state-sponsored communal wood lots, for example, was less than 20 per cent. The government’s HASHI project has not only involved local people in the whole process of landscape restoration, it has built on local institutions instead of creating new ones. Villages have been encouraged to pass their own by-laws to protect communal ngitilis, and traditional village guards monitor activities in the ngitilis. Allowing traditional Sukuma institutions and village governments to oversee restoration efforts has given villagers a sense of ownership and investment in the project’s outcome and has helped ensure region-wide success. The project is ongoing. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/brazil-restoration-of-the-atlantic-forest-mata-atlantica/	Brazil: Restoration of the Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlântica)	Brazil	1999-07-11	1999-07-11	"Instituto Terra is a non-profit organization founded in 1999 by Lélia Deluiz Wanick Salgado and the renowned photographer Sebastião Ribeiro Salgado. It is located at the Bulcão Farm in Aimorés, Minas Gerais, and it covers an area of 676 hectares. Since its inception, the institute has dedicated itself to the restoration of degraded stands of Atlantic Forest both on the farm and in the surrounding region. Nurseries have been established to raise seedlings from local sources, and these seedlings are used to replant denuded areas, and also to support smaller reforestation efforts in neighboring communities. In addition to its restoration research and practice, Instituto Terra has also founded an environmental education center that holds classes for ecosystem users and students from nearby urban centers. Ultimately it is hoped that the institute will become a model for future restoration work in the region and a nexus of sustainable development, resource conservation and ecosystem stewardship.Agriculture & Livestock, Deforestation, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Prior to the colonisation of Brazil in the 16th century, the Atlantic Forest covered over 1,100,000 km2 of the national territory and stretched along its entire southern coast, extending into Argentina and Paraguay. Hunting, wind damage, vine colonisation, fires, the spread of invasive grasses, the exploitation of natural resources such as timber and water, the conversion of forested lands for agricultural use (i.e. cattle ranching and sugarcane and coffee plantations), and the use of pesticides are some of the threats to the Atlantic Forests. The expansion of large cities such as Sao Paolo is also a major cause of deforestation in this region. Indeed, more than 60% of the Brazilian population lives in the Atlantic Forest. Today between 7 and 10% of the original forest remains, and these remaining areas are highly fragmented, further threatening the populations of remaining species. The Máta Atlantica is among the most endangered ecosystems in the world. The Atlantic Forest biome is considered one of the biggest repositories of biodiversity on the planet. The forest harbors around 2,200 species of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians – 5% of the vertebrates on Earth. This includes nearly 200 bird species found nowhere else, and 26 of Brazil’s 77 primate species (including 21 endemic species). The Atlantic Forest is also home to around 20,000 species of plants, representing 8% of the Earth’s plants.
Because of its level of endemism and threat, the Atlantic Forest biome has been selected as a Conservation International Biodiversity Hotspot. The high level of endemism–55% of the tree species and 39% of the mammalian species–is due in part to the fact that the Atlantic Forest is isolated from the major South American forest blocks by the savannas and woodlands of the Cerrado region. Additionally, the forest is distributed over 23 degrees of latitude and encounters variations in altitude and rainfall; it is therefore defined by the diversity of vegetation types and the complexity of the vegetation mosaic. Forty percent of its 20,000 plant species are endemic; 55 of the 250 mammal species are endemic; two-thirds of the primate species are endemic, including the black lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysopygus), one of the most highly endangered primates in the world; and 60 of the 190 reptiles species are endemic, 3 of which are threatened with extinction. Other vulnerable species include tapirs (Tapirus terrestris), ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), pumas (Puma concolor) and the locally endangered blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) (Global 200, EBA, Centres of Plant Diversity). In all, the forest is home to some 29 critically endangered vertebrate species.
Besides its incredible faunal diversity, the Atlantic Forest also holds the world record for the greatest botanical diversity of tree species in one hectare. Four hundred fifty-four species were counted in a single hectare in southern Bahia, and 476 species were found in one-hectare sample plots in the highland of Espírito Santo. This is more than double the number of tree species found in the entire U.S. eastern seaboard. Some of the tree species in this biome include: jequitibá-rosa (a giant that grows 40 meters high and 4 meters round), pinheiro-do-paraná, cedro, figueiras, ipÁªs, braúna, and pau-brasil. The forest structure of the Atlantic Forest contains multiple canopies that support an extremely rich vegetation mix. This includes an astonishing diversity of ferns, mosses and epiphytes (“air plants” or plants that attach to other plants), including lianas, orchids and bromeliads.
The Atlantic Forest biome has some areas, such as Serra do Mar (1,100 meters high) and Itatiaia (1,600 meters high), that are considered altitude forests because there is constant fog. – Restore native forest cover on the 630 hectares of Instituto Terra’s property, and surrounding areas.
– Restore ecological processes and participate in the conservation of local biological diversity.
– Develop cost-effective recovery techniques that encourage strong community participation.
– Monitor and assess forest recovery techniques.
– Develop alternative, more sustainable, low impact instruments and techniques of land occupation for local communities.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Instituto Terra has created an environmental education centre, the Center for Environmental Recovery (CERA), in Fazenda Bulcao. Through the centre, Instituto Terra provides courses about issues such as environmental degradation, ecology, forest management, agro ecology, silviculture, permaculture, environmental education, preventing and fighting forest fires, etc.. The strategy is to work with target audiences and key stakeholders such as high school teachers, community leaders, environmentalists, political and civil leaders and, perhaps most important, the rural producers. In 2002, the centre organised 66 courses for 1300 attendees, and the number of classes in 2003 was expected to double.

Description of Project Activities: Restoration activities are adapted to the four main ecosystem types within the property. Areas covered by aroeira trees were thinned, leaving the aroeira trees at a 6X6 spacing. Tree seedlings from the nursery were planted between the aroeira, and nursery seedlings have been planted in other areas as well. Natural regeneration in these areas is being monitored. Brachiarao grass was dominant in pastures that had been heavily grazed by cattle. The removal of the cattle enabled other herbaceous plants to recover, eventually overshadowing the brachiarao and enabling tree seedlings to grow. The removal of brachiarao grass is an ongoing process in these areas. Areas covered by secondary forest and shrubs are managed in order to promote natural regeneration. In riparian areas, silt is being removed to encourage establishment of native vegetation.

Seeds are collected by specialist collectors and botanical identifiers in the remaining forest fragments in a 150-kilometre radius around Instituto Terra's Bulcão Farm. The nursery provides seedlings for the ongoing restoration at the farm, and it is also able to provide seedlings to local landowners and practitioners of other restoration projects in the region. The nursery is designed to serve as a model for forest restoration and is a means of disseminating new ideas and methodologies. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Since November 1999, 175 hectares have been reforested (26% of the total area), and 470,000 native trees have been planted in areas that were previously either completely degraded or used as pastureland. This emerging new forest is rich in biomass and diversity. The animals which had been disappearing are now returning to the area, as they have found a safe refuge at the Instituto Terra farm. One hundred fifty-six species of birds have been identified on the farm, and 6 of these are endangered species  -  Amazona rhodocorytha (chauá), Amazona vinacea (papagaio de peito roxo), Campephilus robustus (pica pau rei), Procnias nudicollis (araponga), Propyrrhura maracana (maracanã) and Sicalis flaveola (canário da terra verdadeiro). Twenty-one species of mammals have also been seen, two of them in danger of extinction worldwide  -  Callicebus personatus (sauá ou guigó) and Leopardus pardalis (jaguatirica)  -  and two others in danger in Brazil  -  Leopardus tigrinus (gato do mato pequeno) and Puma concolor (sucuarana/puma/onúa parda). The restored forest is now home to over 142 plant species.

Besides biodiversity, water from the Bulcão stream and other springs is beginning to return. A dam that had previously been silted up, along with two other springs, have been recovered thus far. During the dry season, these recovered springs have outflows of around 20 liters/minute. Moreover, we have begun the recovery process of two other springs on the Instituto Terra farm. 

In 2001, The Atlantic Forest Conservation Alliance (SOS Mata Atlántica Foundation and Conservation International - Brazil), donated a nursery for 128,000 seedlings to support Instituto Terra's work. In 2002, the Brazilian Ministry of Environment donated an even larger nursery for 522,000 seedlings. In 2003, close to 160 species of Atlantic Forest trees were developed in the nurseries. Instituto Terra has used these seedlings in its own reforestation efforts, and has also provided seedlings for the Aimorés Project and other projects in neighboring municipalities. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Because environmental recovery in degraded areas is still relatively new in Brazil, most of Instituto Terra's work is based on research and is experimental in nature. Therefore, the restoration proceeds more slowly than it would otherwise.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: An estimated 134,000 Tupi and Guarani people live in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. The ecosystem provides a number of invaluable resources for the communities living within and around it. Vegetation cover provides soil stability, especially on steep slopes, and the biggest extensions of fertile soil in the country are found in the Mata Atlántica. The forest also ensures water supplies for more than 100 million people. Its scenic beauty and biodiversity make the ecosystem a valuable asset for both local communities and ecotourism industries. In all, it is estimated that roughly seventy percent of Brazil's GDP is owed to the resources of this forest.
In order to develop a landscape-scale restoration programme, the institute has had to integrate grassland, secondary woodland, and aroeira restoration objectives. The programme has been successful to this point and has attracted the attention of other individuals and groups with an interest in Atlantic Forest restoration. In fact, a hydroelectric plant in the region is now using Instituto Terra’s techniques and seedlings in restoring the gallery forest. Environmental education and community outreach are integral components of Instituto Terra’s long-term restoration strategy. In accordance with these goals, the CERA education centre has been established to educate people about local ecology and to encourage the sustainable use of natural resources, the conservation of biodiversity, the effective management of water and soil, and the restoration of degraded forest areas. By disseminating information about agroecological alternatives of production and environmental management to schools, community members and rural producers, Instituto Terra hopes to stimulate critical reflection about the current model of development and aid in the formation of future agricultural, environmental and forest technicians in these rural areas.

At three experimental sites in northern Honduras, two species commonly used in the region to create living fences–Gliricidia sepium and Bursera simaruba–were planted in grids to create tree islands. Many of the islands had complete canopy cover in two years and were popular stopovers for roosting birds. The increased seed rain resulting from the birds’ presence, along with the protection afforded by the canopies, produced seedling establishment rates three times higher in the islands than on the open pastures.Agriculture & Livestock Estimates of tropical deforestation in Central America range from 10,000 to 90,000 ha/year, depending upon the source and country in question (Kaimowitz 1997; Utting 1997). Most of this loss results from lands being converted to pasture and seeded with exotic, highly competitive grass species (Uhl et al. 1988; Nepstad et al. 1990; Guariguata et al. 1995; Humphries 1998; Rhoades et al. 1998). – Increase the introduction of naturally dispersed seeds into pastures
– Improve the microenvironment within tree islands
– Reduce competition from grasses
– Accelerate the process of succession within these areas

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: The buffer zone at Pico Bonito National Park is heavily deforested. Within the northern buffer zone, three sites were established for this study. These sites are characterized as follows:
1) an abandoned but well established pasture, which had been seeded with the exotic aggressive forage grasses Urochloa brizantha and Pennisetum purpureum; 2) a ridge that originally was a native pine plantation that had been deforested and was now dominated by the bracken fern Pteridium aquilinum; and 3) an abandoned pasture that had been poorly established 15 years ago and was now dominated by a variety of native grasses and forbs.

The first project activity was a common garden experiment that evaluated the establishment and survival of 11 species locally thought to establish vegetatively. Of these 11 species, two were chosen-- Gliricidia sepium and Bursera simaruba --for further testing of their ability to establish vegetatively and develop cover at the three deforested study sites. These species were chosen because of their prevalence as living fences in tropical America and their adaptation to a broad range of climatic conditions. 

The artificial islands were first established between April and June 2000. At each site, aboveground vegetation was initially cleared using machetes in order to create four blocks, each 20-m wide and 100-m long. Four replicates of each of three island sizes (small [4 m2], medium [16 m2], and large [64 m2]) were created for each of the two species, B. simaruba and G. sepium (n = 12 islands per species per site). One island from each size category, and from each species, was established in each block (n = 4 blocks/ site). Five, 13, and 41 stakes were planted in each small, medium, and large island, respectively (n = 236 stakes per species per site). Stakes were planted at 2-m intervals in a grid format with a fifth stake inserted in each center, equidistant to each of the four corner stakes. All stakes were planted within 1 - 3 days of harvesting. Lastly, all blocks were individually fenced prior to the planting of stakes, to prevent accidental cattle incursion into the study area.

Extensive monitoring of the tree-island study sites followed, and comparisons were made to open pasture areas. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Establishment for Gliricidia sepium was nearly 100% at all sites, whereas B. simaruba ranged from 30 - 50%. Islands comprised of G. sepium stakes developed rapidly, and after nearly two years, a majority of the islands had complete canopy cover, with some canopies reaching heights of 6 metres. Islands of Bursera, on the other hand, failed to develop a uniform canopy, resulting in a higher mortality of stakes and only partial development of canopies. However, the stakes did still provide perch sites for birds.

Twenty-three species of birds were recorded in the study, and they showed an overwhelming preference for tree islands over open pasture. The presence of birds increased seed rain at the tree island sites, thereby accelerating vegetative succession by increasing seedling establishment. Indeed, the dispersal of zoochorous tree seeds was significantly greater (2-fold) in islands than in open pasture, and by the end of the study, seedling establishment in islands was three times that found in open pasture. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: B. simaruba's weak establishment is probably more a consequence of the environmental conditions in the region rather than a reflection of the establishment capabilities of the species per se. In a study in Nayarit, Mexico, Villanueva-Avalos et al. (1996) found higher survival for B. simaruba stakes (approximately 85%) than several other species, including G. sepium. That region is considerably drier (rainfall approximately 800 mm/year), suggesting that B. simaruba establishes better in more arid regions, as indicated in a review by Sauer (1979). 

It is also possible that B. simaruba merely requires a longer dry period after staking in which to establish. The species is highly sensitive to moisture right after planting when the underground portion of the stake is susceptible to rot (Messenger et al. 1997; R. A. Zahawi 2001, personal observation).

Although G. sepium tree islands exhibited favorable results, the study identified several factors influencing their development. First, the size of the island was important for G. sepium plots, as the dispersal of zoochorous tree species was greater in large islands compared to small islands. Also, greater initial stake height and diameter at breast height (dbh) each resulted in greater crown development for G. sepium. Stakes with thinner stems had a lower survival rate. Lastly, damage to the bark of G. sepium as a result of transportation to the site was observed to affect the growth and development of the tree. Thus, the stakes must be handled with care as they are moved from one locale to another.
Living fences are common through out the tropics, but particularly in southern Mexico and Central America. Many species used in fencing are also found as shade trees in coffee plantations and pastures, and they supply fuel wood, fodder for livestock, flood control, soil enrichment (N-fixation) and lumber. Their widespread use, and the ability of these species to establish themselves under the harsh conditions found in pastures, makes them attractive tools for restoration.
Restoration studies that have attempted vegetative propagation of forest species not typically used by farmers have yielded poor results in field trials (Aide & Eusse 1995; Ray & Brown 1995) unless chemical treatment is employed (Granzow-de la Cerda 1999). These projects also require cumbersome and time-consuming studies of the environmental conditions in an area prior to commencement of any restoration work.
The use of living fence species, on the other hand, alleviates these concerns. Living fence species are cheap and widely available, and ready-to-plant stakes can easily be purchased from local farmers (Budowski 1987; Budowski & Russo 1993). Furthermore, local farmers can be consulted to determine which species grow best in the area, the size of the stakes to be planted, and how deep they should be planted. This liaising eliminates the need for extensive pre-restoration studies and allows plantation to begin immediately.
The technique of using live fence species to create tree islands for restoration of abandoned pastures could have broad application throughout tropical America by offering a cheaper alternative to otherwise expensive, labor-intensive projects. "

The National Aquarium in Baltimore initiated a wetland restoration project on Barren Island in order to help offset these losses and restore critical habitat in the Bay region. Since 2001, the Aquarium has been working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Maryland Conservation Corps, Friends of Blackwater and community volunteers to restore portions of the island. Not only was the project site planted with native marsh grasses, dredge material was put to beneficial use in augmenting and stabilizing the island’s eroding shoreline. Post-planting observations have shown that sediment is accreting at the site and that the newly created habitat is nurturing several species of birds, fish and invertebrates.Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Wetlands throughout the Chesapeake Bay region are being lost at an alarming rate as a result of coastal construction, rising seal levels, erosion, ship wakes, land subsidence and damage from non-native species. Thousands of acres have been destroyed and are lost every year. The National Aquarium in Baltimore is working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Maryland Conservation Corps, the Friends of Blackwater and community volunteers to restore 10 acres of salt marsh in the northern and central portions of Barren Island. Two hundred thousand units of salt marsh grasses, including smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) and salt meadow hay (Spartina patens), will be planted which will insure added site stability, reduce the potential for erosion and provide habitat for wildlife. The project targets key recreational fish species including striped bass, speckled trout, weakfish, shrimp, and blue crabs. Restoration will also create habitat for avian species including black ducks, herons, egrets, and bald eagles.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: The project included filling large, geotextile fabric ""tubes"" with sand and placing them strategically just offshore of the existing shoreline. Between these tubes and the shore, material dredged from an adjacent channel maintenance project was pumped to fill in and recreate lowland and intertidal marsh habitat. Once the material consolidated and drained, the Aquarium used its Aquarium Conservation Team of trained and motivated volunteers to complete the planting and monitoring of the Barren Island site.

During the summers of 2001 and 2002, 140,000 units of S. alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) and 10,000 units of S. patens (salt meadow hay) were planted over 7 acres of land. To date, over 302,000 native marsh grasses have been planted with the help of 927 volunteers totaling 7,700 volunteer hours. Aquarium staff and Friends of Blackwater have returned to the site quarterly to monitor the success of this restoration project. Topographic, vegetative, and fish usage data have been collected. In addition, photo station pictures are taken.

Long-term monitoring activities have been planned, and they will include topography surveys, vegetative analysis, and faunal observations. For the topography component, volunteers will measure the advance or retreat of marsh edge vegetation (marsh edge change) during fall and spring via equally spaced transects within each treatment plot.  Additionally, channel and rivulet formation will be measured through elevation change of the sediment along the treatment plot transects.

To aid in measuring topography, uniformly spaced transects will be established across the restored area. Elevation surveys were conducted and vegetation transects were conducted along or near some of the topography transect locations. This allows information gathered in both events to be further used to understand the patterns of site development through the examination of topography on plant survival, coverage and ultimate zonation at no additional cost. This information will assist with future restorations.

For the vegetative analysis, survival estimates and vegetation parameter measurements for the created marsh will be made through the direct survey of live versus dead planting units within the replicate plots during the fall of year one and during spring and fall thereafter until planting unit coalescence occurs. During each collection period, percent vegetation cover will be documented using a 2 m2 (2m x 1 m) quadrate, which will be subdivided into 32, 0.25m x 0.25m subsections. On at least one randomly selected location along each transect the presence/absence of the target species will be noted within the 2 x 1 m quadrate and the number of subsections with live vegetative stems will be recorded.  In addition, at each of these locations, plant stem densities will be estimated by counting the number of live and dead stems from one randomly selected subsection of the quadrate. Vegetation canopy height will be determined from each stem count quadrate for up to 10 randomly selected live and dead stems.

Finally, faunal observations will be made via post-planting faunal collections taken from the restoration site by volunteers under the direction of the Aquarium to compare pre- versus post-planting utilization patterns. Fauna will be collected using fyke and possibly gill nets. Collections will be performed during late summer/early fall. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Initial monitoring from 2002-03 indicates that the project has been successful as wake energy is being absorbed and sediment is in fact being accreted. A very natural marsh community which includes small invertebrates that live in the sediments, larger invertebrates including crabs and shrimp, and fish and birds can be found in the more mature parts of the site that were planted in 2001. The more recently planted areas appear to progressing well toward a similar community.
Long-term maintenance and monitoring of the site will be performed by the Aquarium, the Friends of Blackwater and other local volunteers. Long-term site monitoring is an integral component of the Barren Island project. By collecting data on various physical and biological parameters, we will contribute to an improved understanding of created wetland function, both immediately post-construction and over time. Monitoring variables will include: topographic surveys, vegetative analysis, and faunal observations. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/netherlands-restoration-of-the-scheldt-estuarys-sieperda-tidal-marsh/	Netherlands: Restoration of the Scheldt Estuary’s Sieperda Tidal Marsh	Netherlands	1990-11-10	1990-11-10	"During a severe storm in 1990, a dike was breached in the brackish part of the Scheldt estuary, and tidal influence was returned to the Sieperda polder. Tidal intrusion into the former polder turned crop fields into mudflats and changed pastures into salty marsh vegetation. The digging of a new creek in 1993 improved marsh hydrology and enhanced tidal intrusion further into the marsh. Ten years after the dike breach, the former polder has changed into a brackish tidal ecosystem, and monitoring activities have focused on documenting this transformation and understanding its driving forces. Observations and analysis have shown that renewed tidal influence resulted in geomorphologic changes that, in turn, directed the vegetation succession and ecological developments giving rise to a restored salt marsh habitat. Thus, it has been concluded that tidal flow is the engine of tidal marsh restoration.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The estuary has been in an almost continuous state of change during the 20th century. Because of land reclamation, reinforcement of dikes, and the deepening of the shipping channels, about 2,500 hectares of mudflats and tidal marshes have been lost since 1900. Substantial parts of the remaining marshes have reached the final stage of succession. Sheltered areas with the potential to develop into intertidal areas and marshes have become very scarce. The estuary contains important habitats for shellfish (cockles) and juvenile flatfish (plaice and flounder), and it provides important habitat for many species of birds. Migratory birds use the area for foraging, and a number of coastal breeding birds nest along the estuary. To understand the forces driving ecological change in the Sieperda marsh since the dike breach in 1990

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: In 1966, a sand dam was constructed on the Sieperda marsh parallel to the existing sea dike to accommodate gas and water pipelines. The area between the dam and the sea dike was closed off from tidal influence by the construction of a relatively low (summer) dike, turning it into a polder, 85% of which was leveled and used for cattle grazing and agriculture. Only the easternmost part of the polder, closest to the estuary, kept its natural geomorphologic structure. A long ditch was dug along the sand dam for drainage of rainwater and occasional floodwater. Several smaller ditches were linked onto the main drainage system. Because the summer dike was relatively low, the area frequently flooded in winter. In 1976 and 1985 the dike gave way during sever storms but was subsequently repaired. After another dike breach in 1990, it was decided not to repair the dike and allow the area to be returned to tidal influence once again. The accidental breach turned the Sieperda polder into a developing tidal marsh. This project did not have a specific restoration goal but offered an opportunity to learn how the return of tidal influence would have its effect on a stretch of reclaimed land. 

During the past 10 years, four independent studies were conducted, dealing with changes in hydrology and geomorphology, vegetation structure, benthic fauna, and bird populations.

The propagation of the tidal wave (velocity and amplitude) was measured during complete neap-spring tidal cycles using pressure sensors (PTX 630, Druck, The Netherlands) at three locations. A pressure sensor was placed on the bed in the center of the creek. Tidal surveys were performed in 1992, 1993 (twice), 1995, and 1996 (Sánchez Leal et al. 1998).

The developments in creek and marsh morphology were studied by conducting field surveys and by interpreting aerial photographs. Sedimentation and erosion rates in creeks and on the marsh surface were monitored along six transects, five transects perpendicular and one transect parallel to the direction of tidal flow. Altimetry measurements were performed along the transects by leveling on an annual basis from 1992 onward (Komman & van Doorn 1997; Sánchez Leal et al. 1998). All bed levels were measured relative to Dutch Ordnance Datum (N.A.P.). From the changes in bed levels over time sedimentation rates on the marsh were calculated. Creek and tidal flat development was also determined by analyzing aerial photographs taken in 1990 and 1995.

The monitoring of developments in vegetation succession commenced in 1993. At the start of the study, 29 permanent quadrats (PQs, 2 x 2m) were marked along seven transects, which were evenly distributed across the marsh. The composition of the vegetation within each PQ was surveyed annually in September. For each plant species, the percentage cover was estimated using a percentage gradient. Marsh areas reflecting less than 25% of maximum reflectance were considered uncovered or sparsely covered.

The sampling of benthic macrofauna started in 1995 and was performed annually in September, the end of the growth season when maximum biomass was expected. Ten sampling sites were selected that were evenly distributed over those parts of the marsh not covered with vegetation. Six sites were situated on mudflats and four in shallow supralittoral pools. Through the years, some sampling sites became overgrown with vegetation, and these sites were excluded from the study. Infauna was sampled by taking ten 30-cm deep sediment cores at each site with a round metal corer (diameter 4.5cm). The cores were sieved over 1-mm round mesh and stored in 4% neutralized formalin. Hyperfauna, in this case the fauna living near the bottom in the shallow water of the pools, was sampled with a hyperbenthic sampling net (width 25cm, mesh 1.25mm). Each sample was the result of a 20-m haul. The residue was preserved in 4% neutralized formalin. Each sample was analyzed in the laboratory to species level, where possible using a binocular microscope; and biomass (ash free dry weight) was determined by drying (80ÂºC, 48 hr) and ashing (570Â°C, 2 hr) each sample (Stikvoort 2000).

The significance of the developing marsh for breeding birds was studied by monitoring and mapping the exact nest sites in 1991, 1994, 1997, and 1999 using standard procedures (Hustings et al. 1985). During the breeding season, the area was visited at least six times, and all observations of breeding were recorded. All water birds in the marsh were monitored on a monthly basis as part of an existing long-term monitoring program. The number of water birds (grebes, herons, geese, ducks, and waders) were counted or estimated around high tide, using binoculars and telescopes, when the birds concentrated at high-tide roosts. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: In the eastern part of the Sieperda marsh, geomorphologic changes were very pronounced. Creeks became wider and deeper over time, and levees developed. The sedimentation rate on creek levees was high and constant, while the sedimentation rate in the floodplain areas of the marsh changed with time. During the first years after the construction of the creek, the sedimentation rate was higher (3 cm/yr) than average for Scheldt estuary marshes, which is approximately 1.5 cm/yr (Krijger 1993). The new creek, constructed in 1993, allowed larger tidal volumes into the developing marsh, causing increased creek erosion and enhanced sediment availability. After this period of strong sedimentation, the sedimentation rate of the floodplains approached values characteristic for the estuary. The period 1997-1999 was characterized by the strong growth of Phragmites australis (common reed), a dense and high vegetation very capable of sediment trapping. This is thought to be the main cause for the increased sedimentation rate observed during this period.

In the western part of the marsh, hardly any geomorphologic changes occurred. The sedimentation rates were less than 0.5 cm/yr, and creeks did not develop. The large difference in development between the eastern and western marsh is caused by the weak tidal influence in the western marsh, which was unable to alter the geomorphology.

After the reintroduction of tidal influence, the former crop fields, as well as those parts of the former pastures with poor drainage, turned into bare mudflats or areas very sparsely covered with vegetation. Vegetation succession on the mudflats was initiated with the establishment of the salt marsh species Aster tripolium and Puccinellia maritima, followed after several years by Scirpus maritimus and Atriplex prostrata. The former pastures were initially characterized by common grasses such as Agrostis stolonifera, Elymus pycnanthus, and E. repens. In the low-lying and moist areas, A. stolonifera was replaced almost completely by the salt marsh species P. maritima and A. tripolium after the return of tidal influence. In the higher and drier parts of the former pastures, A. stolonifera and E. pycnanthus could survive and were accompanied by marsh plants such as P. maritima, A. tripolium, and Juncus gerardi. In closely cropped areas in the westernmost distant part of the marsh with insufficient drainage, pioneer species such as A. tripolium, Salicornia spp., Spergularia marina, and Glaux maritima could flourish. From 1995 onward, the colonization of the mudflats progressed rapidly, probably as a result of improved drainage after the construction of the new creek in 1993. In recent years, Phragmites australis became established in the marsh and expanded rapidly.

In 1995, the first year of monitoring and 5 years after the dike breach, estuarine benthic fauna was well established in the newly developed marsh. A total of 19 taxa was observed in the marsh over the period 1995-1999. The observed insects and fish (goby) inhabited the supralittoral pools. Species diversity between years varied from 14 to 17 taxa. Species densities fluctuated between 4,000 and 40,000 individuals/mÂ², with an average of some 10,000 individuals/mÂ². Total biomass fluctuated between sampling sites and years and varied between 1 and 27g ash-free dry weight/mÂ². Relative species abundance also fluctuated over time, although the two most abundant species (Corophium volutator and Nereis diversicolor), often accompanied by several oligochaete spp., constituted more than 80% of total species density at most sampling sites. In fact, C. volutator and N. diversicolor alone accounted for more than 80 to 90% of total biomass at most sites. 

The return of tidal influence in Sieperda marsh appears to have affected breeding birds, because breeding habitats changed as a result of vegetation development and succession. Not surprisingly, a number of bird species that breed on salt marshes, such as Anser anser, Tringa tetanus, and Luscina svecica, have taken advantage of the new situation. Acrocephalus scirpaceus, a species breeding on marshes or reed beds, was also able to benefit. On the other hand, species whose feeding habitat is restricted to mudflats (such as Dunlin) declined in numbers as vegetation succession progressed. The number of Oystercatchers, a species that breeds in sparsely vegetated areas, also declined with increasing vegetation. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: After the dike breach in 1990, the tidal flow into the polder was restricted at first due to the existing drainage network. In 1993, a new wider creek was dug in the center of the area, enhancing tidal influence into the developing marsh. Although tidal influence into the marsh improved, the distal part of the marsh experienced tidal influence only during spring tides and showed a spring to neap tidal cycle instead of a diurnal cycle as observed in the proximal part of the marsh. A typical tidal curve shows a slightly asymmetric sinusoidal wave, with a shorter flood than ebb duration. The tidal range in the estuary near Sieperda marsh, including the easternmost part of the marsh, varied from 4 to 6m. After the construction of the new creek and bridge in 1993, the average tidal range behind the bridge increased from 0.75 to 1.75m. Three years later, the average tidal range had increased to 2.3m. Tidal influence further into the marsh is hampered by the width of the bridge acting as a bottleneck and the very slow growth of the creek in the central part of the marsh due to the presence of a solid surface layer of clay. As a result, there is no creek penetration into the western part of the marsh, and tidal volumes in this area are small.
The reintroduction of tidal influence, and the resulting geomorphologic changes, directed the ecological changes in the former polder. It can be concluded that the restoration of the Sieperda marsh has been successful, at least in the eastern (seaward) half of the marsh. Developments in the western half, both geomorphologically and ecologically, were less pronounced due to a hampered tidal influence. Widening the bridge and enlarging the creek through the clay layer would improve tidal influence in this area.
Because Sieperda marsh once was part of the adjacent Saeftinge marsh, the marsh surface level (more than mean high water level) at the time of the dike breach was typical of an old salt marsh. Therefore, vegetation succession commenced rapidly and within 10 years reached the stage of the emergence of common reed (P. australis). A more gradual and natural rate of succession could be achieved by leveling elevated parts of the marsh, which would rejuvenate the process of marsh development and stimulate the settlement of pioneer vegetation. Salt marsh restoration through depoldering, while shown to be successful in this and other projects from northwestern Europe, is a contentious issue that demands a careful balance of competing interests: flood control and coastal protection, maintenance of port facilities, and ecosystem vitality and longevity. Because the public is still accustomed to the idea of reclaiming land from the sea, and because tidal marshes are not as highly valued as agricultural fields, public support for projects such as these has been limited to date. Thus, the long-term success of this project, and others like it, depends upon the ability of restoration planners and practitioners to garner public support and demonstrate the utility of restored coastal systems as an important means of improving coastal resilience and defense.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/australia-salt-marsh-restoration-at-the-olympics-2000-site-homebush-bay/	Australia: Salt Marsh Restoration at the Olympics 2000 Site (Homebush Bay)	Australia	1993-07-09	1996-07-09	"As part of a large-scale remediation strategy for the Olympics 2000 site, the New South Wales Olympic Coordination Authority commissioned the restoration of two saline wetlands in Homebush Bay near Sydney, Australia–North Newington and Haslams Creek. Before beginning the full restoration of both sites, however, project planners first conducted experimental transplantation at a pilot site in the Haslams Creek wetlands. Modifications were made to the site’s hydrology and sedimentation dynamics, and then cuttings of six species from nearby donor sites were transplanted along a gradient. During the subsequent 2-year monitoring period, growth and survival rates were documented in an effort to better understand the effects of salinity, sedimentation, and tidal influence on the species’ survival, and to predict patterns of colonisation and zonation in the recreated saltmarsh systems.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The wetlands of the Parramatta River basin were part of the first river catchment on the Australian continent to experience urban development, having been visited and mapped within 10 days of the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788. The highest wetland losses in the catchment have been of saltmarsh, partly because they are drier and therefore more easily `reclaimed’ than mangroves, and partly because mangroves tend to regenerate by colonising new mud flats created by increased sedimentation from works upstream. The Homebush Bay wetlands are estimated to have been reduced to less than one-sixth their original size over the last 200 years (Katchka, 1992).
The Newington North wetlands were used for salt-farming and cattle grazing in the early nineteenth century, and were then enclosed in the Royal Australian Navy Armaments Depot (RANAD) Newington, occupying approximately one-quarter of its area, in the north-east of the site adjacent to the River. The Naval Depot operated for approx. 100 years until its recent transfer to the OCA. The presence of the Navy, while it protected the area from many impacts of the later urbanisation of Sydney, led to further trenching, waste dumping and associated disturbances by the Navy itself. Nevertheless, the plant community appears to be a remnant of the original vegetation (Clarke and Benson, 1988). The most recent major impact on the Newington North wetlands has been the loss of tidal flushing. This has been partly the result of dredge-fill dumping from the river, which has elevated the area somewhat relative to the shoreline, and partly because, over the last decade, channels dug by the Navy to enhance tidal flushing have become almost entirely choked by sedimentation and mangrove colonisation.
The second area of saline wetlands is represented by remnant patches of what was once a continuous border along the tidal length of Haslams Creek. Abattoirs and brickpits were constructed adjacent to the Creek earlier this century, leading to polluted storm-water run-off, and a large area of wetlands and was used as a waste dump for domestic and industrial purposes. The estuarine intertidal ecosystem of New South Wales consists of mosaics or zonal bands of mangroves and saltmarsh. The mangroves normally occupy the area from just above the low tide mark to mean high tide levels (the area occupied by `lower marsh’ in colder climates), and the saltmarsh extends from mean high to high high tide levels (that is, only the `upper marsh’ zone in colder latitudes).
The saltmarsh communities of Homebush Bay in particular are regarded as the most important in the Sydney region, because of their size and species composition (Adam, 1996). They are also valued as a waterbird habitat, and have been recognised by the Australian Government via inclusion on the register of the National Estate, in bilateral protection agreements with China and Japan, and through the government’s assent to the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (RAMSAR) (OCA, 1995; Straw, 1996). The OCA’s goal for wetland rehabilitation is the restoration of full ecosystem functioning, if possible, by means of rehabilitation of the plant communities (OCA, 1996). It is hoped that the rehabilitation of habitat will lead to the natural recovery of the faunal complement of the system, which is at present very depauperate (Berents, 1993). Particular attention will be given to the re-establishment of three saltmarsh species which are rare in Port Jackson, and whose biology is largely unknown. These species are Lampranthus tegens (F. Muell.) N. E. Br., Wilsonia backhousei Hook. f., and Halosarcia pergranulata (J. Black) Paul G. Wilson. If possible, the area covered by these three species will be increased, and the maintenance of local biodiversity will thus be ensured.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Site modeling and baseline ecological studies were the first project activities undertaken. Data was collected to ascertain the presence and distribution of different saltmarsh species (especially those of the three rarer species), the extent of tidal influence, and sediment conditions at the project site. These data were compared to corresponding data from reference sites in Port Jackson and the wider Sydney region in order to compare species composition, zonal distribution and substrate conditions supporting mangrove and saltmarsh species.

Restoration then began at an experimental plot on a tidal inlet of Haslams Creek that had been used over the previous 30 years or more as an industrial waste dump. Between the waste dump and the edge of the creek was a band approx. 15 m deep of mangroves, Avicennia marina var australasica. (Forsk) Vierh. The banked up area behind the mangroves was excavated to a depth of 3-4 m to remove the waste, and re-filled to a lower level using clean fill from a building site in the city.

The experimental plot was approximately 70 m wide by 80 m deep, at right angles to the Creek. This area included a band about 20 m deep immediately behind the mangroves, and at the same level (i.e. mean high tide mark) so that the transplants would not be shaded by the mangroves. The remaining 50 m length was graded to form a ramp, at a slope of approximately 1 in 100 m, i.e. to a total elevation of about 50 cm above the level of the mangroves, before curving up into a fairly steep bank. Levels were checked by laser-aided survey, and at each successive 10 cm elevation, 20 planting stakes were set out across the ramp. The plot was then left for tidal inundation and salination to take place over a 3-month period before the first transplantations were carried out.

Two series of trial cuttings were taken, in November 1993 (late spring) and in May 1994 (late Autumn). In each trial six species were used, the three dominants S. quinqueflora, S. australis and S. virginicus, and the three species rare in the area, W. backhousei, L. tegens and H. pergranulata. For each species, new season tip-and-stem cuttings were taken from other nearby saltmarsh stands. The cuttings were taken from as many plants or clumps as possible, both to avoid damage to individual plants, and to maximise genetic diversity of the transplant stock. The cuttings were placed between sheets of wet horticultural capillary matting for transportation back to the glasshouse.

The cuttings were first washed in tap water to remove any salt build-up, and then dipped for 5 s into 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for surface sterilisation, and rinsed in distilled water. Except for S. virginicus, for which internode segments were used, tip segments were used, and sometimes two or three single-node segments from immediately behind the tips. On the basis of a pilot test of rates of root production, the cut ends of all but L. tegens and S. quinqueflora were then dipped into root-promoting hormone gel, `Clonex Purple', Growth Corporation, Fremantle, WA. The cuttings were set out in germination trays containing a 1:1 sand: peat mixture. The trays were then placed in a fogging tent in the glasshouse with bottom heat under a sand base (25Â°CÂ±5Â°C). When root and shoot growth were established, the plantlets were hardened off, first by lifting the tent flaps and lowering the level of fog, and then on the glasshouse bench. They were then potted up into small pots usually containing a 3:2 sand:peat mixture. After approximately 10 days to acclimatise, the plantlets were gradually salinated at 2-day intervals over a 2-week period, to a final watering concentration of half-strength seawater, before being planted out at the experimental plot.

At each of the 20 stakes, at each of the five successive 10-cm elevation levels, two plantlets of each of the six species were planted in a radius of approximately 0.5 m around the stake, i.e. a total of 40 cuttings of each of the six species at each elevation. The plantlets were hand watered 2-3 times per week with tap water for 6 weeks after planting out, to help them survive the summer heat.

For the follow-up study the experimental ramp was divided into a grid consisting of seven columns (i.e. at right angles to the Creek) by seven bands (across the site). Three of the columns were then randomly chosen for sampling plants and substrate. Up each of the three ramp columns, three 0.25 m2 quadrats were placed randomly within each of the seven bands, to measure numbers and sizes of coloniser plants. Substrate samples to a depth of 10 cm were also collected from every band of each of the sampled columns, and pH, water content, conductivity and organic matter (loss on ignition) were estimated.

Rehabilitation activities were later conducted at the Newington wetlands, although not in association with the pilot project discussed here. At the Newington site, weed clearing, re-levelling at putative saltmarsh zonal levels, and transplantation of S. quinqueflora, L. tegens, W. back- housei were carried out during 1996 in the first of four segments of the wetlands to be inundated. The transplantations in this area were not of cuttings, such as were used in the experimental trials at Haslams Creek, but clumps or mats of plant material which had to be removed from the Haslams Creek area in order to make way for the major reconstruction of the wetlands there as part of the restoration exercise. In February 1997, tidal flushing was restored to the Newington site, by the opening of a large canal (approximately 10 m width, 4 m depth) to the river. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Seasonal measurements were taken over a 2-year period at the Haslams site. Colonisation by both mangrove seedlings and saltmarsh species took place on the experimental ramp, as well as along unplanted corridors (approximately 2 m wide) that ran along either side of the ramp to provide access for heavy machinery used in the construction phase.

The survival and rooting rates for all species in the spring trial were higher than 90%, whereas in the autumn trial the rates ranged from 60 to 80%. In addition, the spring/summer transplants had much better field survival and growth rates than the autumn/winter series, which were very low.

Of the three common dominants, S. quinqueflora showed significantly higher survival rates up the whole tidal gradient than the other two species, indicating its tolerance of a wide range of substrate conditions. With S. australis and S. virginicus, it appeared that they may have needed a higher level of soil water than was consistently available in the middle levels of the ramp, but which was supplied by more frequent tidal inundation at the lower elevations, and by a slightly greater freshwater input from the bank behind, at the upper edges of the site.

With respect to the three rare species, it was the other chenopod, H. pergranulata which, like S. quinqueflora, showed the highest survival rates up the entire tidal gradient. This was an interesting result, since in our ecological studies it was found that the H. pergranulata most commonly occurred either in supra-marsh elevations, above S. virginicus, or on salt scalds. The results indicate that in this species, although growth can be sustained over a wide range of substrate conditions, recruitment and establishment may depend on other factors which more strictly limit its distribution in the wild. L. tegens survived and flourished only at the uppermost elevations of the ramp, which is consistent with the levels found in the ecological study. W. backhousei had very low field survival rates, but they occurred at both the lowest and highest elevations, again where it can be inferred there would be more consistent substrate water contents.

The growth of S. quinqueflora was greatest at the lowest elevations, which is consistent with the ecological findings. As noted above, S. australis had similar survival rates at the bottom and top of the gradient; however, growth was ten times as great at the upper elevations of the ramp, which had some intermittent freshwater seepage from the bank behind. For reasons which are unclear, S. virginicus, which normally grows on the upper edges of the marsh, in this experiment grew a little better at the lower levels (P < 0.05), though survival rates were similar in both zones. Although there were reasonable to high survival rates for H. pergranulata at every elevation, plant growth was two to three times greater towards the top of the gradient.

It was found that over the period from the first transplanting, the three commonest Sydney wetland species had colonised much of the site, A. marina at the lowest elevation, with S. quinqueflora and S. australis at higher levels. The water levels on the ramp, as expected, declined with elevation, although from field observations it was known that the moisture levels at the top of the gradient, under the bank at the back of the plot, appeared higher from time to time than at the middle levels which were only inundated during spring tides each month. Conductivities increased up the ramp to the highest elevation sampled, where it declined once more, indicating the balance varying with elevation between relative frequencies of inundation that would increase salinity, and the leaching effects of freshwater input. Organic matter levels were twice as high at intermediate elevations than at either the top or bottom of the ramp. This may have been due to an accretion effect from the tides at these levels, since the total plant cover of transplants and colonisers was sparser there than at higher or lower levels. Colonising S. quinqueflora and S. australis were present at every level sampled.

The conductivity levels at this site, which is on a fully flushed tidal creek, were much lower than those recorded in the ecological studies of the Newington North wetlands. However, elements of the normal zonation bands of the wetlands had been established within the 3 years.

At the Newington North wetlands, tidal flushing was restored to the site via the canal constructed in 1997. As expected, the canal has caused the draining of a previously more or less permanent stagnant lake, which had existed since the cessation of tidal influence over 10 years ago. Consequently, the whole segment is somewhat drier than it had been before, excepting the zone flooded during neap tides. This new hydrology should favour an increase in the area of saltmarsh at the expense of mangroves over the next 3-5 years (Burchett and Pulkownik, 1996; Mamouney, 1996; Burchett et al., 1998). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: At the Haslams site, S. quinqueflora showed significantly higher survival rates up the whole tidal gradient than the other two dominant species. This success was likely due to S. quinqueflora's tolerance for a wide range of substrate conditions. S. australis and S. virginicus, on the other hand, may have needed a higher level of soil water than was consistently available in the middle levels of the ramp. These species met with more success at the upper and lower elevations, where more frequent tidal inundation (lower) and a slightly greater freshwater input (upper) created more favourable conditions. 

None of the rare species was among the colonizers observed at Haslams, either on the ramp or in the corridors. This suggests that their limited distribution and abundance in the area are related to biological factors limiting establishment--i.e. low seed production or fertility, inefficient dispersal mechanisms and/or low seedling viability.

At the Newington wetlands site, the renewed tidal inundation did not follow completely the pattern predicted by modelling and therefore, did not reach the transplants. Consequently, transplants are being irrigated manually until they can be transferred to other patches in Newington or back to a restored Haslams Creek wetland. Almost all of the S. quinqueflora planted at Newington died within 3 months, probably as a result of dehydration, but both of the rare species are so far surviving.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Over the last decade there has been an increased community awareness in Australia of the value of wetlands and the need for their conservation to ensure plant biodiversity, protect fisheries nurseries, improve water quality in the estuary, and assist in the survival of migratory bird species. There is a community interest in the restoration and preservation of these wetlands, as evidenced by frequent reminders in the public media of the environmental obligations of the OCA. Community concerns have been expressed to the State Government regarding water quality improvement, pollution reduction, and fisheries restoration, as a result of which special funding has recently been made available for cleaning up Sydney. It is to be hoped that the example of coastal ecosystem rehabilitation offered at the Olympics 2000 site will assist in the evolution of future policies and practices in this region, as well as in a further public appreciation of the ecological and resource values of these areas.
The transplantation trials reported here had a number of shortcomings. They were confined to one site; two sets of cuttings only were assayed; and the tests were conducted on only six of a suite of about 15 species regularly found in the Sydney saltmarsh. In addition, the fill used as the substrate for the experimental plot was unlike the natural sediments in which saltmarsh is found in this region. Nevertheless, the results have been of use in providing a further understanding of the biology of the species concerned, and practical pointers to the development of rehabilitation strategies for the site. First, they show that the six species used can all be propagated readily from cuttings, using standard horticultural methods, with no added salt. It has also been shown that survival and growth from cuttings taken in spring/summer (temp. range 18-28Â°C) are much more successful than from those taken in autumn/winter (temp. range 1117Â°C).
This project has also shown that if a new area is constructed in which the appropriate conditions of hydrology, salinity and tidal flushing are provided, at least some of the common wetland species will colonise and cover a significant proportion of the area within 3 years. Thus, transplantation is not necessarily required, at least for a number of the common species. All that appears to be needed for natural rehabilitation of these species is the provision of an intertidal area with appropriate environmental conditions. The rehabilitated natural areas of the Olympics 2000 site, which include two stands of estuarine wetlands, (named the Newington North and Haslams Creek stands), as well as freshwater wetlands, a stand of Cumberland Plain (eucalypt-dominated) woodland and a native grassland, will become part of a new Millennium Parklands. The Parklands will be maintained in perpetuity as an ecological amenity for the State of New South Wales and its visitors. "

During the past twenty years, eastern Contra Costa County has undergone a rapid urbanization, and in 1997, the county approved a development agreement for this property that would have allowed for the construction of 4,500-6,100 housing units on the site. When the City of Oakley incorporated in 1999, the Dutch Slough property was within the city limits, and the City was required to accept the County’s development agreement. In the fall of 2001 the Natural Heritage Institute (NHI) and the Department of Water Resources identified this site as an important restoration opportunity and began working cooperatively with the former landowners to obtain grant funding to acquire and restore the property. The 1,166-acre site was purchased in 2003, and restoration planning was still ongoing as of 2006. Restoration activities are expected to last at least 30 years, and the project will be conducted using an adaptive management framework, whereby management actions will be designed to test hypotheses about the ecosystem and the most effective strategies for its restoration. In this way, the project will yield valuable insight into the processes governing restoration and will increase our overall understanding of the science.Agriculture & Livestock The three parcels that comprise the Dutch Slough site were diked and drained for agriculture during the nineteenth century, perhaps as early as the 1850’s. Emerson, Little Dutch Slough, and the eastern portion of Dutch Slough are all artificial channels that were dredged between 1904 and 1910. These artificial channels displaced a pre-existing channel network that was more sinuous and irregular. Before European colonization, the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and their tributaries carried water, sediment, nutrients, other dissolved and suspended constituents, wood, organisms, and other debris from basins (of more than 25,000 and 14,000 square miles, respectively) to their confluence in an inland delta, thence through Suisun, San Pablo, and San Francisco Bays to the Pacific Ocean. The channels of these rivers served as habitats and migration routes for fish and other organisms, notably several distinct runs of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), steelhead trout (0. mykiss), and Pacific lamprey (Lampetra rridenrata).
Marshes were a major feature of the lowlands of the Central Valley, especially the San Joaquin Valley, where they surrounded the huge, shallow lakes at the southern end of the valley–Lakes Buena Vista and Tulare. The Delta itself was a vast marshland, the present-day islands vaguely defined by natural levees of slightly higher ground.
The Dutch Slough site was one of these tidal marshes, and it was bordered by seasonal and riparian wetlands and Pleistocene dunes at the historic delta of Marsh Creek. 1. Provide shoreline access, as well as educational and recreational opportunities.
2. Benefit native species by re-establishing natural ecological processes and habitats.
3. Contribute to scientific understanding of ecological restoration by implementing the project under an adaptive management framework.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Dutch Slough Restoration Committee has been established as a forum to exchange information, obtain input into the restoration planning and keep interested partners informed about other projects and regional issues that affect the Dutch Slough project. Key agencies and stakeholders have been invited to attend and participate on this Committee, and the meetings are open to the public.

Description of Project Activities: The Emerson, Gilbert and Burroughs families sold the Dutch Slough properties to the California Department of Water Resources on October 30, 2003. DWR is working with the project partners and the AMWG to determine the best way to restore the site. The project partners hired a consulting firm, Phillip Williams & Associates to help develop restoration alternatives and conduct a feasibility analysis of those alternatives. Planning and feasibility studies were still ongoing as of 2006. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Restoration activities at the Dutch Slough site are only just beginning and are expected to span more than 30 years. However, preliminary site assessments and feasibility reports have offered some insights into the eventual recovery of wetland habitat at the site. What follows are some of the expected outcomes of the project.

The topographic and edaphic diversity of the Dutch Slough site creates the opportunity for restoring a diversity of wetland and upland habitats. Many wetland restoration sites are intensively graded to create a mosaic of habitat types. At Dutch Slough, it would be possible to create a mosaic of wetland habitat types along a gradient from open water to dendritic tidal marsh to seasonally inundated floodplain and riparian forest without any site grading. Restoration of the site could create large areas of edge habitat including shaded riverine aquatic and riparian habitat types along the property's extensive shoreline. The site has nearly 6 miles of relatively barren levee shoreline along major tidal sloughs and Marsh Creek that could be revegetated. Tidal inundation to the interior of the site would add nearly 10 miles of edge habitat. The spatial complexity and the daily wetting and drying of the mash edges should help young salmon and splittail avoid predators and provide an abundant source of chiromindae larvae, one of the main food sources for rearing splittail and salmon (Brown, in press). Furthermore, a range of elevation gradients within a wetland site, as well as disturbance regimes associated with sediment input and other fluvial processes, result in greater biodiversity and utilization by native aquatic species (Bayley 1991).

The site encompasses ten different types of organic and mineral soils. This diversity of soils will result in a corresponding diversity of vegetation and habitat types, including riparian and dune species. Coarser mineral soils will allow for establishment of woody riparian species intermixed with freshwater marsh species, while the relatively high elevation aeolian deposits of Delhi sands will provide an opportunity for restoring Antioch Dune plant species on the site.

The area surrounding Dutch Slough provides habitat for numerous declining and endangered species, and habitat restoration at Dutch Slough could significantly improve conditions for many of these sensitive species. Big Break, the Marsh Creek delta, and lower Marsh Creek already harbor Sacramento splittail, Chinook salmon, Delta smelt, and other aquatic species for which the Dutch Slough site will be restored. Dutch Slough may also be an excellent opportunity to restore waterfowl habitat. One distinct sub-habitat that may provide substantial habitat value for waterfowl without undue artificial engineering of the marsh (e.g. water control structures and diked marsh) may be shallow, large ponds along the terrestrial edges of the site, where spring high tides and runoff may form brackish seasonal or perennial ponds. Native submerged aquatic vegetation that thrives in open water and ponds (especially pondweeds, Potamogeton spp.) would provide valuable foraging opportunities for waterfowl (Baye 2004).

Indeed, the diversity of birds and other animals along the Big Break shoreline, in Marsh Creek, and upstream suggest that many other CALFED priority species will use the restored Dutch Slough site. Over 150 native species have been observed (Glover, pers com; Orlof 2000), of which 18 are CALFED priority species (r - Bank Swallow, Black Rail, Sandhill Crane, Swainson's Hawk, Yellow Warbler; m - Black Tern, Black-Crowned Night-Heron, California Gull, Common Yellowthroat, Cooper's Hawk, Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, Northern Harrier, Snowy Egret, White-Faced Ibis, White-Tailed Kite, Yellow-Breasted Chat, Western Pond Turtle). A recent survey of lower Marsh Creek by a DWR biologist confirmed a western pond turtle population of approximately 15-20 individuals (Hamilton, pers com, 2001). East Bay Regional Park District scientists and USFWS experts believe the area also supports giant garter snakes (Bobzien pers. com. 2001).

In addition to providing valuable habitat for important faunal species, the Dutch Slough project could also provide an opportunity to restore rare, riparian plant communities that were once more common in the Delta but are now extinct or nearly extinct. Dr. Baye suggested that the existing levees would provide a suitable opportunity for creating stands of the willow-ladyfern community. The sand mound riparian woodland is another rare plant community that could be restored on the site, perhaps on the sand deposits in the middle of the Burroughs parcel.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The Dutch Slough site will provide an opportunity for people to access the Delta shoreline and learn about the process of wetland restoration. The popular Marsh Creek Regional Trail, which extends from Antioch Pier to the City of Brentwood, already traverses the southwestern boundary of the site. More trails are planned, and the project team is developing a public access master plan to define the exact location and configuration of the trail network. The conceptual trail plan negotiated with the City of Oakley assumes that the trails will be largely confined to the top of the levees and the southern edge of the site near the base of the Contra Costa Canal; however, this conceptual plan may be revised during development of the public access master plan. As currently conceived, the trail system will circumnavigate the Emerson parcel along the existing levee road. The road will eventually be paved to accommodate emergency vehicles and policing. Wildlife viewing platforms and small-scale fishing piers may be developed along the trail to sufficiently provide for and direct public access. The interior of the Emerson parcels will be open to canoe and kayak access along a prescribed water trail. Facilities will also be constructed for a combination of active and passive recreation, including sports fields, interpretive and educational centers, and a swimming lagoon on the 55-acre community park site just south of the actual restoration site. In the short term, project partners are planning site tours, canoe trips and other activities to give people (especially Oakley residents) an opportunity to visit the area before it is officially open to the public.
The Dutch Slough project provides a significant opportunity to improve understanding of restoration science in the Delta ecosystem. Adaptive management employs the scientific method to maximize the information value of restoration and management actions. With the assistance of a panel of scientists, the project team will design restoration actions to test hypotheses about how the ecosystem functions and how best to achieve the project objectives. In this respect, adaptive management interventions are conducted as experiments. Project implementation will be guided by the best available information but will be monitored and implemented with the goal of increasing our understanding about the science of restoration. Project partners realize the restoration must be planned and implemented carefully to avoid any unintended negative impacts. The project team is therefore committed to implementing the project in accordance with the following:
– Avoid and/or mitigate degradation of drinking water quality
– Minimize the potential for mercury methylation
– Measure and monitor water quality impacts
– Minimize the establishment of nuisance species through design and management (Project partners are working closely with the Contra Costa Mosquito and Vector Control District (CCMVCD) to design the project in a way that limits mosquito growth and West Nile virus.)
– Avoid and/or mitigate impacts to existing infrastructure and easements on and immediately adjacent to the property "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-washington-duwamish-river-estuary-intertidal-wetlands-restoration/	USA: Washington: Duwamish River Estuary Intertidal Wetlands Restoration	United States of America	1992-07-06	1996-07-06	"The Duwamish Estuary in Seattle, Washington has been subject to heavy industrial development and pronounced anthropogenic disturbances associated with the Port of Seattle and other commercial facilities along its waters. This project sought to restore intertidal wetlands at three sites in the estuary, and to thereby enhance public access to the river and create vital habitat for several important species of birds and fish. While project activities varied from site to site, hydrologic modifications were the central focus at all three. Periodic site monitoring has indicated varying degrees of recovery at the project sites, but it has also suggested that human activities continue to threaten the estuary’s wildlife populations.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The Duwamish River provides a passageway to the inland portions of Washington state, and thus has been an area of heavy industrial development. Construction and barge companies, as well as concrete, glass, steel, and lumber factories have all been a part of its economic fabric. This development, while playing a significant role in the economic expansion of the Seattle region, has taken a heavy environmental toll. The developmental history of the Duwamish Estuary has resulted in the loss of approximately 98% of its former intertidal marshes and mudflats. These habitats are critical to juvenile salmon and many other species of aquatic and terrestrial wildlife, and their loss represents a serious threat to the ecological integrity of both the Duwamish River Estuary and the greater Puget Sound. To partially restore salmon and other aquatic wildlife populations and their habitat; to enhance public access to the river; and to improve the quality of life along this active waterfront.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Three sites along the Duwamish River were identified for initial restoration: the Turning Basin, the General Services Administration (GSA) site, and Terminal 105. These three areas were chosen based on their availability and suitability for restoration and their potential to show marked improvements in critical habitats with restricted funding. Each project had three basic phases: first, the removal of debris; next, the regrading of the shoreline and bottom sediments to restore appropriate intertidal elevations, and; finally, the reestablishment of a riparian buffer.

There are a number of habitat reconstruction technologies being demonstrated in this group of projects. At the GSA site, restoration included removal of rock riprap and a large overwater wharf structure to allow natural colonization by existing wetland plants; construction of a sediment ""bench"" at 0.0-m elevation to promote use by juvenile salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.); and planting of upland riparian vegetation. The T-105 site originally consisted of a vacated street end and a large pipe that drained a small degraded wetland area. Restoration included removal of debris and replacement of the pipe with an estuarine channel that restored tidal flow to the area. Finally, the Turning Basin site consists of an upland riparian buffer planted with native vegetation and a small regraded upper intertidal basin planted with fringing native sedge, Carex lyngbyei, and rush, Scirpus maritima. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The restored habitats appear to be experiencing increased benthic invertebrate abundances, with the number of taxa ranging from 11 to 29, depending upon the site. In particular, at T-105, the channel and the ""delta"" region near the mouth have developed invertebrate densities similar to those found at the other restored and reference sites, especially for the amphipod taxa Corophium spp. and Eogammarus confervicolus. This is notable because the T-105 site is at a higher elevation than the benthic reference flats and might have been expected to have lower densities because of this difference. 

Some of the created habitats are becoming colonized with ecologically important benthic invertebrates. In addition to Corophium and Eogammarus, the sand substrates at the T-105 site are populated by high densities of the polychaete worm Manayunkia aesturina and the harpacticoid copepod Huntemannia jadensis, a prey species for juvenile flatfish. The high intertidal sandflat at the Turning Basin restoration site has had high numbers of ceratopogonid fly larvae (in two consecutive years), and Mesochra rapiens, a common oligohaline harpacticoid copepod and fish prey species (J. Cordell, unpubl. data, Snohomish and Chehalis river estuaries) was abundant in 1997. The important juvenile salmon prey taxon Harpacticus was found only at the GSA intertidal bench and another created bench in the lower waterway (Cordell et al. 1996).

Numbers of meiofaunal taxa from 1997 benthic samples ranged from 13 - 33 taxa per site/date. Several taxa were unique to a site, including Coullana canadensis and Pseudobradya sp.at the Turning Basin mudflats, Mesochra rapiens and Onychocamptus mohammed at the Turning Basin sandflat, and Tachidius triangularis at the T-105 channel and delta. Harpacticoid copepod nauplius larvae, turbellarian flatworms, and nematode worms were relatively abundant at all sites. However, harpacticoid nauplii and nematodes reached particularly high peak densities at the Turning Basin mudflat reference and restoration sites.

During nine seasons of monitoring, 87 bird species have been observed on the Duwamish waterway. Seasonally, the greatest number of species were seen during the spring months (58 species in spring ""˜97 and 48 species in spring ""˜98), and the fewest species were sighted during the summer months (38 species in summer '97 and 34 species in summer ""˜98). Sightings of native and human-associated species at site T-105 has changed little over nine seasons of data collection. At the Turning Basin restoration site, passerines continued to be a strong presence, especially in the fall and spring. In 1998, red-winged blackbirds bred successfully in the cattail marshes, and American goldfinch exhibited territorial behavior all season and foraged with their fledglings in and around the Carex cages. Shorebirds and waders were regularly observed at the Turning Basin restoration site at all times of the year. This site consistently had the greatest shorebird diversity of all sites.

Birds continued to use each site differently. Birds in transit were observed most frequently at T-105, while direct site use (e.g., foraging and resting) occurred primarily at Kellogg Island (the reference site) and the Turning Basin restoration site. In fact, Kellogg Island and the Turning Basin restoration site had the most consistent year-to-year patterns of habitat use.

Patterns of emergent vegetation have been observed at each of the project sites. In 1997, understory at the GSA site was dominated by S. marina, Cotula coronopofila, and Lilaeopsis sp. Understory species were found in every quadrat, and 3 to 6 species were found in each quadrat. At the Kellogg Island reference site, 3 to 4 species were found in each upstream quadrat and the understory was dominated by C. lyngbyei, Potentilla  palustris, Plantago maritima, and Distichlis spicata. Carex has begun to recruit to this site, and the distributions of shoot density and height of the Carex recruits were both quite skewed. The Kellogg Island reference site had little or no C. coronopofila, Salicornia virginica, or Grindelia integrifolia. The GSA site had no C. lyngbyei, D. spicata, R. repens, or Triglochin maritimum.

At the T-105 site, Atriplex patula was recruiting heavily to both sides of the channel. It was found in every systematic quadrat placed along the upstream and downstream sides of the channel. D. spicata, P. maritima, S. virginica, S. validus, and Juncus effusus were found in one quadrat each. Eleven patches of Scirpus maritimus, 7 patches of S. virginica, 5 patches of S. maritimus, 3 patches of P. maritima, and 1 patch each of D. spicata, Cotula coronopofila, P. maritima, Atriplex patula, J. effusus, and Scirpus acutus were counted along the 220-m downstream bank.

At the Turning Basin, a diverse assemblage of species has begun to develop in areas that have been protected from goose grazing. Sixteen species were observed in the sampled area, and between three and eight species were found in each quadrat. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The Turning Basin shows the greatest promise for bird habitat among the three project sites. As it is relatively isolated, it was already a magnet for birds prior to the restoration project. Furthermore, two new restoration projects adjacent to this site will create additional habitat and linkages with existing habitat.

The T-105 site, on the other hand, has shown a declining abundance and diversity of birds as a result of increasing levels of human activity and anthropogenic disturbances. The timing of the downward trend in avifaunal abundance at T-105 was closely tied to the construction and operation of the rendering plant to the west of the T-105 site. During initial construction, a vacant lot was cleared of trees and brush where 15 - 20 white-crowned sparrows had previously been observed foraging and exhibiting territorial behavior. Since then, no more than one male white-crowned sparrow has ever been seen at T-105. In 1997, killdeer nested in the shrub roses above the slough at T-105 as evidenced by chick vocalizations and broken-wing displays by parents. However, in 1998 there was no sign of nesting activity and killdeer were seen less frequently than in 1997. In 1998, an increase in human activity at T-105 was also observed. People were present during almost every visit and frequently were accompanied by dogs. Upland habitat loss and continued disturbance may result in a permanent decrease in the number of birds at the site.

With regard to plant diversity, different challenges are faced at each site. The main impediments to the spread of vegetation in upstream areas seems to be riprapping and goose grazing; whereas downstream areas are limited by strong wave action and destruction by debris. Seed availability does not appear to be a limiting factor since many species will actually germinate when they are protected from grazing (Caren Crandell, Center for Urban Horticulture, Univ. Washington).

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Volunteer youth groups were used in the planting of the intertidal and riparian buffer areas, and were thus afforded an opportunity to learn about the importance of these intertidal ecosystems and the methods employed in their restoration.
Periodic monitoring will occur at these sites. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/united-kingdom-england-salt-marsh-reclamation-in-the-blackwater-estuary/	United Kingdom: England: Salt Marsh Reclamation in the Blackwater Estuary	United Kingdom	1995-04-08	1995-04-08	"Managed realignment, or depoldering, is a cost-effective means of restoring tidal flow to coastal areas in order to encourage the re-establishment of salt marsh ecosystems. This technique involves breaching or dismantling earthen embankments along the coast in order to ensure regular tidal flooding of a given site, and thereby facilitate its natural recolonization. England has more than 50 such restoration sites, and several of these are located in the Blackwater Estuary of Essex on the southeastern coast. One of these sites, Tollesbury, was restored through partial breaching of an embankment in the spring of 1995. The site was one of the first relatively large-scale, managed-realignment projects in the UK, and as such, it has been closely monitored in an effort to understand and document the gradual recovery of its intertidal habitat. While many plant and animal species have returned to the site, factors such as salinity and sedimentation have limited the number of colonizing species from adjacent marshes and have played a role in shaping the re-establishment of distinct plant communities there.Agriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry This 21-hectare site formed part of the Tollesbury and Old Hall salt marshes until it was embanked in the late 18th century and transformed into agricultural land (Boorman et al. 1997). The Blackwater Estuary is a breeding area for the Little Tern (Sternula albifrons), and a transit point for the Ringed Plover (Charadrius hiaticula). Species that winter in the estuary region include the Pied Avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta), Black-tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa islandica), Dark-bellied Brent Goose (Branta bernicla bernicla), Dunlin (Calidris alpina alpina), Eurasian Golden Plover (Pluvialis apricaria), Grey Plover (Pluvialis squatarola), Hen Harrier (Circus cyaneus), Common Redshank (Tringa totanus), Ruff (Philomachus pugnax), and Common Shelduck (Tadorna tadorna). – To retreat the line of coastal defence
– To restore salt marsh habitat for conservation purposes by breaching the existing flood embankment
– To investigate and document the re-establishment of natural intertidal processes and habitat

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Economic considerations necessitated a breach of the embankment, rather than its complete removal. Modelling studies undertaken by HR Wallingford revealed that creating a double breach would result in the development of a circular flow within the site. Therefore, a single breach was designed in the east of the flood embankment with dimensions of 50m wide at the embankment crest with 1:5 slopes at the base at 0.8m ODN.

Prior to breaching the embankment, plots were flooded via sluices in order to raise the salinity of the sediments. Certain plots were then seeded with glasswort and seablight, while others were planted with plugs from natural salt marsh surrounding the site containing sea aster and sea lavender.

On August 8, 1995, a single breach was made in the embankment to provide tidal input to the site. The wall was first lowered over a distance of ca. 1m and the tide allowed to flow into the site. Tidal velocities reached 7 cubic meters per second, which were sufficient to widen the breach to ca. 3m after 1.5 hours. Over the following days, the breach was gradually widened to its pre-determined width of 50m. A drainage ditch was cut in the base of this breach to 0.2m ODN to connect with the existing creek system. A herringbone drainage system was then constructed.

The strip of salt marsh from the front of the embankment at the breach site was transplanted to the side of the creek. As a result of public pressure, existing hedgerows and trees were not removed, but were left to die naturally. A considerable fetch builds up across the site, and these hedgerows have formed natural wavebreaks.

Monitoring activities followed the managed realignment, and natural plant colonization in the restoration site (i.e. community species pool) was monitored annually beginning in 1997 (i.e. the second growing season after de-embankment). Three transects of 20 m wide and 125 m long, subdivided into 2500 contiguous quadrats of 1 m2 were established. Each transect was laid out perpendicular to the new seawall and extended for 125 m from high to low elevation towards the breach. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The number of established target species in the restoration site was less than 10 % of the maximum regional species pool in the first year after de-embankment. Our results show that it took approximately five years for species diversity in the restoration site to become similar to a local reference marsh (Old Hall and Tollesbury marshes), which contained less than 40 % of the species of the regional target species pool.

Colonization of the transects started with the arrival of Salicornia spp., Suaeda maritima, Sarcocornia perennis and Spartina anglica. In the third year of restoration (i.e. an intermediate stage), the biggest increase in number of species occurred with the establishment of Aster tripolium, Atriplex portulacoides, Puccinellia maritima and Spergularia marina in the transects. The ""late establishers"" included Elytrigia atherica, Limonium vulgare and Spergularia media, which established four or five years after de-embankment.

Salicornia was by far the most abundant species in the transects during the entire study period, followed by Suaeda in the third and fourth year after the breach. From the sixth year after the breach, Puccinellia became the dominant species of the upper part of the transects, and gradually extended seaward; whereas Spartina increased its abundance at lower elevations. The upper one metre strip of transect 1 was dominated by Spergularia marina in the fourth and fifth year after the breach. All species except Salicornia and Spartina occurred in highest abundance at the upper zone of the transects.

The majority of species in the upper zone showed a sigmoidal increase in frequency of occurrence over time, either towards the maximum value of 100 % (Aster Puccinellia, Salicornia, Spergularia media, Suaeda) or towards a lower value (Atriplex portulacoides, Limonium). Spergularia marina showed an optimum in frequency of occurrence after seven, four and six years in transects 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In the intermediate zone, where five of the nine species occurred with a frequency of more than 10 % for three consecutive years, response curves for all species except Suaeda were also sigmoidal towards the maximum value of 100 %. Suaeda showed a peak after two years of restoration, after which the abundance rapidly declined, especially in transect 2.

Based on abundance and percentage cover data, three different National Vegetation Classification (NVC) communities could be distinguished in the restoration site by 2001 (TableFit, Hill (1996)). The upper part of the transects changed from annual Salicornia salt marsh (SM8, (Rodwell 2000)) in the first three years of restoration via Suaeda maritima (SM9) salt marsh in transects 1 and 3 to Puccinellia salt marsh (SM13a) after six or seven years of restoration. In the intermediate and lower zones of the transects, annual Salicornia salt marsh formed the only distinct plant community. The NVC communities of the adjacent marsh included annual Salicornia salt marsh (SM8) at the lowest zone and Puccinellia salt marsh (SM13) at the two higher zones. No unexpected non-target species have established so far, indicating the suitability of the site conditions for the species from the pre-defined species pool.

After eight years of restoration, 11 target species, or 32 % of the regional species pool, had established in the Tollesbury restoration site. This saturation index was low compared to other de-embankment sites of similar or younger age in north-west Europe where indices were generally above 45 % (Wolters et al. 2005b, Chapter 3). The number of species that colonized the restoration site at Tollesbury was also lower compared to two other managed realignment sites in the same estuary. The oldest of these sites, Northey Island, had already contained 12 target species after three years of restoration, whereas at Orplands, 15 different species had established within seven years after the seawall was breached (Wolters et al. 2005b, Chapter 3). On the other hand, the rate of plant colonization at Tollesbury was similar to that of an estuarine restoration site in the USA, which was opened to tidal inundation after being embanked for 70 years (Thom et al. 2002).

During the period before any vegetation cover developed, results showed a net negative sediment budget for the restored sites as tidal flows eroded the areas adjacent to the breaches. Sedimentation rates were high during the summer months when the Salicornia sp. was flourishing, but the deposited material was removed during the winter when the vegetation died back. Consequently, the result for the first 3 years was zero annual accretion. However, as soon as perennial species such as Puccinellia maritime, Atriplex portulacoides, and Spartina anglica began to colonize the restored surfaces, erosion of the surface during the winter months was reduced, resulting in net annual accretion.

Bird surveys and observations indicate that the site is being used by a variety of birds, including black-tailed godwit, dunlin, redshank, grey plover, brent geese and two egrets. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Atriplex portulacoides and Limonium were the only two species suggesting a maximum abundance of less than 100 % had been reached at the highest elevation zone within the study period. Although Atriplex has good reproductive ability, producing between 20 and several hundred seeds per plant and capable of spreading vegetatively at a rate of 1.3 cm per year, the species and especially its seedlings is intolerant to waterlogging (Chapman 1950). The prevalence of poorly drained soils may therefore explain its restricted abundance at Tollesbury, especially since Puccinellia, a species that tolerates waterlogged soils, was the first perennial species to reach 100% abundance. Generative reproduction in Limonium may be limited as the plants rarely flower until the third year (Boorman 1967) and viability of the seeds is very low compared to other salt-marsh species (Hutchings & Russell 1989). This species is a poor competitor for light (Boorman 1967) and its abundance may be limited by the presence of other perennial species. In general, the sigmoidal increase in abundance of perennials in our study suggests that their population dynamics are mainly determined by clonal growth, possibly as a result of limited germination and seedling establishment due to high soil salinities (Shumway & Bertness 1992).

It was originally hypothesised that species abundance in the species pools and dispersal traits would be among the most important factors for plant recolonization. Nevertheless, the discriminant analysis indicated that salt tolerance was more important in determining the sequence of species establishment than abundance of the species in the local species pool or dispersal traits. For example, Triglochin maritimum was still absent from the restoration site after eight years, even though it was present in 12.2 % of the plots on the adjacent marsh. The Ellenberg value for salinity describes this species as being characteristic of salt meadows and upper marshes subject to occasional tidal inundation, or consistent brackish conditions (Hill et al. 1999). Other species present (though with a frequency of less than 2 %) on the adjacent marsh but absent from the restoration site include Armeria maritima, Festuca rubra, Juncus maritimus, Plantago maritima and Seriphidium maritimum. The Ellenberg values for salinity of these species are all below six, indicating that these species are slightly salt tolerant and generally occur on upper marsh sites not inundated by all tides. With less than 10 % of the restoration site at an elevation above the level of mean high water spring tide these species have little chance to establish. 

There has been some criticism of the provision of a breach rather than the total removal of the embankment. Although the remaining flood embankments are not to be maintained and will eventually fail, this may take several decades. In the meantime, the tidal flows within the site are constrained and the difference in elevation between the breach and the minimum surface of the site means that the lower parts of the site act as a sump at low tide. This, in turn, means that sedimentation within the site will tend to be concentrated within the ""˜sump' area, and higher areas will receive commensurately less material. Thus, sedimentation will undoubtedly influence the rate and extent of recovery at the site.

Another factor that will determine the success of the managed realignment at Tollesbury is the scarcity of salt marsh species in the community species pool. The site was first embanked more than two centuries ago, and the halophytic species disappeared from the established vegetation. Hence, target species have to disperse into the restoration site from a local species pool (i.e. adjacent salt marsh) or regional species pool (i.e. all salt marshes within a biogeographically uniform region) (Zobel et al. 1998). This is a slow and uncertain process, and managed-realignment sites elsewhere in northwestern Europe have seen only 26 to 64% of species from the regional species pool successfully re-establish themselves (Wolters et al. 2005b).
Observations have shown that the first species colonizing the Tollesbury restoration site are highly salt tolerant with two of the three species also being abundant in the local species pool. These species occupy the lowest elevation zones, which are inundated most often and which may increase the chance of a diaspore being transported from the source area into the restoration site. Species that are still absent are characteristic of higher marsh zones which are occasionally inundated. Their absence is mainly explained by the sparse availability of suitable space for establishment, possibly in combination with low abundance in the local species pool and reduced opportunity of dispersal by tidal water due to their occurrence at higher and less frequently flooded elevations. The difference between intermediate and late establishers appears to be related mainly to a combination of abundance in the local species pool and flotation time. Sowing or planting these species may help to increase their rate of establishment. Monitoring of this site is ongoing. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/canada-nova-scotia-cheverie-creek-salt-marsh-restoration-project/	Canada: Nova Scotia: Cheverie Creek Salt Marsh Restoration Project	Canada	1999-07-03	2005-12-03	"The Cheverie Creek Salt Marsh Restoration Project began as a pilot project for the province of Nova Scotia and is the first such restoration effort to be undertaken there. Aiming to restore tidal flow to Cheverie Creek, project staff coordinated the replacement of an existing, undersized culvert in the Highway-215 causeway with a larger aluminum culvert that allows greater tidal flooding of the ecosystem. It is hoped that restoring the hydrologic integrity of the site will yield more vibrant bird and fish populations, more extensive salt-marsh vegetation, a decrease in the number of mosquitoes, and greater flushing of extant salt pannes. As this project is the first in Nova Scotia, project staff had to actively network with government agencies and other restoration practitioners in order to develop protocol, build relationships and garner support for future projects. Moreover, project staff worked closely with the local community and implemented a number of educational programs in order to inform the public about the importance of salt marsh ecosystems and directly involve them in the restoration process.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The salt marsh and tidal river system at the Cheverie Creek site was partially restricted by an undersized wooden culvert (1.5 m x 1 m) in the two-lane causeway (Highway 215) that crosses the mouth of the creek. Because this culvert was originally equipped with a clapper gate to prevent upstream tidal flow completely, trees, shrubs and other freshwater vegetation became established on much of the marsh’s surface. It is not known when or how the gate was removed, but one of the intense winter storms common to the area is thought to have been responsible. Even without the gate, though, the culvert was still too small to allow regular salt water flooding of the entire marsh, and partial obstruction by rocks and other roadway material further exacerbated the situation. Spring tides were restricted by as much as 1 meter, and tidal flooding was thus prevented for approximately 75% of the marsh area. These conditions resulted in the encroachment of freshwater vegetation, limited fish passage, loss of fish habitat, infrequent recharge of salt pannes (and a resultant rise in the mosquito population), risk of flooding during spring tides, erosion problems, and a safety hazard represented by strong currents and whirlpools at the mouth of the culvert. Cheverie Creek is a wetland system encompassing approximately 70 acres and comprising a range of wetland habitat types–salt marsh, brackish, tidal fresh, fresh and upland edge. Cheverie Creek is predominantly high marsh, with the dominant species being Spartina patens (47% of total marsh area). Low marsh habitat is dominated by Spartina alterniflora (18% of total marsh area). A range of high-marsh and upland-edge plant species common to Fundy marshes are also present at Cheverie Creek, including Juncus geradii, Carex paleacea, Solidago sempervirens and Ammophila breviligulata. Furthermore, a number of brackish, freshwater and terrestrial plant species are also present (Tpyhaceae sp., Scirpus maritimus and Rubus strigosus).
Cheverie Creek provides important ecological niches for a variety of bird species. The tidal component of the system supports habitat for salt-marsh-dependent bird species such as Nelson’s Sharp-tailed Sparrow (Ammodramus nelsoni) and Willet (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus). During pre-restoration monitoring, twenty-eight species of waterfowl, shorebirds and wading birds were observed on the Cheverie Creek system. The birds most often observed were Semi-Palminated Sandpipers, Tree Swallows, and Nelson’s Sharp-tailed Sparrows. Other species included: American Black Duck, American Crow, American Goldfinch, American Robin, Bald Eagle, Black Capped Chickadee, Cedar Waxwing, Double-crested Cormorant, Eastern Blue Jay, European Starlings, Great Blue Heron, Greater and Lesser Yellowlegs, Kingfisher, Least Sandpipers, Merlin, Northern Flicker, Northern Harrier Hawk, Pileated Woodpecker, Red Winged Blackbird, Herring Gull, Solitary Sandpiper, and Yellow and Black Warblers. The overarching goal of the Cheverie Creek Salt Marsh Restoration Project is to facilitate the restoration of a more natural tidal regime in a tidally-restricted marsh and wetland system. Other goals encompassed by this project are to galvanize the support of property owners and the local community for salt marsh restoration both at Cheverie Creek and at other sites in the area, and to develop collaborative relationships with regulatory agencies to promote and facilitate salt marsh restoration throughout Nova Scotia.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The project staff worked closely with a steering committee comprised of representatives from the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Mt. Allison University, the Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History, and the Ecology Action Centre. Efforts were made to involve community members throughout the project and to solicit feedback on such things as design considerations, effects of the culvert replacement on local land dynamics, and ecological changes that would likely result from the project. Communication methods included community meetings, letters to local residents, and written articles in local and provincial media sources.

Description of Project Activities: Cheverie Creek was chosen as the site for this pilot project because a relatively large area of marsh habitat could be improved by means of a comparatively inexpensive culvert replacement. Furthermore, the area is ideal as a demonstration and learning site because it is located just across the highway from a popular picnic and viewing area and is, thus, easily accessed by the public.

Besides the project site, a reference site also had to be established to provide control data that would guide and elucidate post-restoration monitoring activities. Bass Creek, located approximately 5 km north of Cheverie in Bramber, is an unrestricted tidal river and salt marsh system that is also spanned by Highway 215. Unlike the crossing at Cheverie Creek, however, the Bass Creek crossing is a combination causeway-bridge structure, and the bridge spans the entire width of the main river channel. Hence, the data collected at Bass Creek allows for a comparison of the vegetation as well as the mosquito, bird, and fish populations in an unrestricted system versus a tidally-restricted one.

Before the replacement of the culvert could begin, baseline data had to be collected at Cheverie Creek in order to facilitate effective post-restoration monitoring of project results. Surveys of vegetation, hydrology, salinity, soil, sedimentation, groundwater, marsh elevation, and bird, fish, and mosquito populations were conducted in the summers of 2002, 2003 and 2004. Basic habitat mapping using a Global Positioning System (GPS) was also conducted. This data was collected by project staff, students, and volunteers from EAC and the local community, and it was used to develop a hydrology model to predict how the replacement of the culvert would affect the marsh and to provide a baseline for later comparison. 

Project staff sought to build community support for the restoration by speaking with property owners, making presentations to community and environmental groups, leading marsh tours, conducting community meetings, publishing articles in local newspapers, creating information displays, providing regular community updates, and starting a partnership with a local school. EAC also worked to enhance community relations by lending its support to local organizations dealing with tangential issues such as bloodworm harvesting in the area. Other networking activities involved consulting and collaborating with salt marsh restorationists from around the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine in order to ensure that the restoration efforts employed in this project conform to the research and monitoring standards in the region at large.

Construction on the new culvert began in December 2005 and was the last phase of the project. Hydrologic tidal modeling indicated that replacement of the existing tidal crossing with at least an 8-m by 3-m culvert would completely remove the restriction and allow 52% of tides to flood the majority of the marsh surface. Therefore, the existing wooden culvert was replaced by a 9.2-m by 5.5-m elliptical, aluminum culvert installed by Dexter Construction Limited through a Department of Transportation and Public Works (DOTPW) tender. This new culvert increased the opening approximately seven fold--from 4.7 m2 to 32.6 m2. An aluminum arch structure was chosen over concrete because of its long lifespan (an estimated 50-75 years), its superior resistance to salt water, and its relatively quick installation time. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Approximately 30 hectares of tidally restricted salt marsh habitat have benefited from the installation of the new culvert, and the community has now taken ownership over a planned education and interpretative centre. The recovery of Cheverie Creek is expected to take several years, and therefore the full extent of the project's success will only be ascertained with the realization of long-term monitoring activities. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Longer-term monitoring is needed in order to evaluate the site's recovery and determine what factors, if any, represent limits to restoration success.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Salt marshes play a vital role in coastal ecosystem health. They help control coastal flooding and shoreline erosion, improve water quality, contribute significantly to coastal and marine food webs, and provide valuable habitat for fish, birds and other wildlife. They also reduce mosquitoes and the risk of flooding and provide neighboring communities with educational and recreational opportunities. We anticipate that the Cheverie Creek Salt Marsh Restoration Project will provide an excellent opportunity for the many visitors to the area (locals and tourists alike) to learn about the importance of salt marsh ecosystems and current efforts to protect and restore them.
One of the main contributions of this project has been to lay the groundwork for future restoration efforts by filling in some of the gaps in knowledge and skill currently existent in this field. There is a lack of data on the extent and condition of salt marshes and their potential for restoration; there is little information and technical expertise for salt marsh restoration in Canada; and there is a lack of clarity about the roles and responsibilities of practitioners and the regulations and permits pertaining to salt marsh restoration. With support and collaboration at all levels, project staff have made significant headway in addressing each of these challenges.
This project has also helped draw attention to the imperative for salt marsh restoration in the Bay of Fundy. When the project was begun, salt marsh restoration was not a major priority in Nova Scotia. However, the involvement of the EAC in this effort has raised the level of awareness and responsiveness to salt marsh restoration at all levels of government. The EAC has provided much needed information, technical support, training, contacts and coordination to facilitate future restoration projects in the Bay of Fundy. Entities such as the municipal council in West Hants, the provincial Department of Transportation and Public Works (DOTPW), and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans have started to institutionalize salt marsh protection and to incorporate salt marsh restoration into their planning. While sometimes it is frustrating when government takes over an idea, the kind of “mainstreaming” that has resulted from the work at Cheverie Creek is important for the long-term sustainability of the project and for the replicability of salt marsh restoration around the province. Post-restoration monitoring is being conducted by CB Wetlands and Environmental Specialists and will last for five years. The focus of this monitoring will be on the physical and biological components of the Cheverie Creek system (both before and after restoration), as well as those of the Bass Creek reference site, in order to record ecological changes and habitat/species responses to restoration.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/denmark-restoration-of-dune-habitats-along-the-danish-west-coast/	Denmark: Restoration of Dune Habitats along the Danish West Coast	Denmark	2001-11-28	2005-11-28	"Through a grant from the European Union’s LIFE program, this project sought to restore more than 8,000 hectares of dunes and dune heaths on the western coast of Denmark, fully 65% of the country’s dune area. Under pressure from several invasive species, principally Pinus mugo and Pinus contorta, the dunes were cleared using a variety of techniques and approaches. Densely overgrown areas were felled and cleared, while less dense areas were rehabilitated with a combination of controlled burning, renewed grazing, and mowing with tractors. In addition to aggressive clearing activities, this project also incorporated several hydrologic components, in which drainage trenches were filled in order to trap moisture in the dune system and thereby revitalize niches dependent upon surface water. This facet of the project was intended mainly to create and enhance habitat for several herpetofaunal species, most notably Bufo calamita. At every stage of the project, practitioners worked in close collaboration with local governmental agencies as well as private landowners with property adjacent to the management area. Although there sometimes arose administrative and logistical delays, the interface between management planners and community stakeholders was cooperative and productive overall.Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) The main threats to the dune habitats are the large-scale invasion of non-native species, lack of natural dynamic processes (i.e. over-stabilization), and eutrophication. The species invading the dune heaths are mainly Pinus mugo and Pinus contorta. The trees are spreading from the dune plantations established along the Danish West Coast more than 100 years ago to mitigate dune mobility. The encroachment of these and other woody species creates a shadowing effect that alters the microclimate of the region and disrupts natural processes of nutrient circulation. These changes in the ecology of the dune heaths jeopardize native biodiversity and imperil the longevity of the ecosystem. Dune heaths are characterised by great variation – both in terms of the terrain and the animals and plants which live there. The dynamic dune heath is a mosaic of dry plains, moist hollows, shallow lakes, and dune formations. The plains are dominated by crowberry (Empetrum) and heather (Calluna), and the vegetation in the hollows includes bell heather (Erica), bog whortleberÂ¬ry (Vaccinium), purple moor grass (Molinia), bog myrtle (Myrica), and willow (Salix). In the dunes, the vegetation is dominated by sand sedge (Carex), helmet, grey hair-grass (Corynephorus), and lichen.
Several species of herpetofauna inhabit the dune heath ecosystems, including Bufo calamita, Rana arvalis, Lutra lutra and Triturus cristatis. The dunes also provide important habitat for many common and rare species of birds, Grus grus and Tringa glareola among them. The project goal was to restore threatened and vulnerable coastal dunes and dune heathlands along the
Danish West Coast, in order to regain a favourable conservation status for the area. This objective was to be obtained through the following field activities:
– Clearing of 542 ha of dense overgrowth (overgrowth degree III).
– Removal of tree encroachment on 3452 ha (overgrowth degree II).
– Management activities on more than 2800 ha in order to counter threats from nutrient enrichment and lack of natural dynamics (overgrowth degree I).
– Restoration of natural hydrology on site 72 (Lyngbo Hede) and site 78 (FanÁ¸), and restoration of dune heath on site 184 (Stenbjerg).
– Land swaps on roughly 36ha on site 78 (RÁ¸mÁ¸), in order to remove land-ownership related barriers to habitat management.
– Restoring natural hydrology in the project areas containing decalcified fixed dunes with a mosaic of humid dune slacks in order to secure viable populations of amphibians, primarily Bufo calamita and Rana arvalis.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Measures were taken to restore hydrologic processes at several of the project sites. A 1-kilometre long drainage trench, up to 3 metres deep and 3 metres wide, from the 1960s traversed site 72, Lyngbo Hede, and drained the dune heath and the nearby holiday cottage area. Groundwater measurements at 22 points within the project area showed that the trench had a significant drainage effect on the southwestern part of the heath, lowering the groundwater table up to 1,5 m in the summer and thus having a significant effect on the low-lying wet areas. A preparatory project was conducted in order to determine the most feasible way to restore the natural hydrology on the dune heath, without negatively affecting the holiday cottage area. The restoration was done by laying down pipes in the trench on a 630-metre stretch, including outlet mechanisms for extreme conditions, ensuring that the drainage effect on the heath is significantly reduced, while the holiday cottage area will not be negatively impacted. The pipes were covered with materials from the heath, ensuring that the natural undulating landscape was maintained.

Hydrologic issues were also addressed on two other project sites. At sites 78 and 184, drainage trenches were closed in order to restore natural hydrology, and thereby expand the wet habitats on the dune heath and maintain the mosaic pattern of microhabitats in these areas. A shallow trench on site 78 (FanÁ¸) was closed in 2005, resulting in a longer retention of surface water in the area during the summer and a raised water table that will assist in keeping the area free of invading trees. On site 184 (Stenbjerg-Lodbjerg), several such trenches were closed. Because project expenses turned out to be much lower than initially foreseen, it was decided to close trenches at other sites, including site 26 (Á…lvand).

The eradication of invasive trees and/or unwanted vegetation proceeded according to predetermined categories for the degree of overgrowth observed at a given site. Forest stands categorized as having overgrowth degrees of IV or V (i.e. the most densely overgrown) were selected for conversion through felling, chipping and removal of unwanted material. These areas were mainly old plantations of Pinus mugo and Pinus contorta, which were planted more than 100 years ago in order to halt the sand drift. The areas selected for felling were often protruding as narrow strips into the dune heath, and removal of these plantations created a much more coherent dune heath landscape. High priority was given to clearing of stands in low-lying wetter areas, as this is believed to give the highest return in terms of biodiversity benefits for birds and amphibians. The trees were felled either by machinery or motor-manually, according to the local conditions. The trees were then converted to wood chips, and typically sold to district heat plants. The original target was to manage 264,3ha under this action, and the end result of 388,1ha managed is therefore very satisfactory.

Areas where tree encroachment had taken place over a period of up to 50 years were assigned to overgrowth degree III and selected for clearing. The trees were felled motor-manually and transported out of the area. In hilly terrain or wet areas, where the use of machinery would be too damaging, the trees were collected in small heaps and burned. In flat areas, smaller trees and bushes were destroyed using a tractor-mounted mulcher.

In areas with overgrowth degree II, self-sown trees (mainly non-native species, primarily Pinus mugo and Pinus contorta) were felled and removed, or mulched. The trees have invaded the dune heath from nearby plantations, and removing them at this early succession stage reduces the risk of significant biodiversity loss. It also reduces the cost of future management efforts to keep the dune heath in a favourable conservation state. Solitary trees were felled and collected in heaps, which were burned. Smaller trees growing in patches on flat areas were removed by a tractor-mounted mulcher.

In the areas designated as overgrowth degree I, a variety of techniques was used to clear vegetation. Low-intensity grazing was introduced or extended in some selected areas. In order to maximise the nutrient removal, no supplemental fodder was provided for the livestock. On state owned land, the grazing rights were leased out to local farmers, but as the grazing value was very limited, no profits were gained from this.

In other overgrown areas, mosaic burning was employed in lieu of grazing. The burning of dune heath in a mosaic pattern of small irregular patches is, in many places, a very efficient management tool. In order to control the fire, the vegetation is usually cut (with a tractor-mounted mulcher) in a narrow belt around the areas to be burned. Thereafter, on the lee side of the belt a small counterfire is started, before the actual fire is started on the windward side. The shape of the burned areas is undulating and set according to the local conditions in hopes of achieving a more ""natural"" look. Burning takes place mainly in February and March, and only outside the breeding season of birds and other inhabitants of the dune heath. Some weather conditions are not suitable for burning, and delays were sometimes experienced due to wet spring weather. Even on project sites very close to residential or holiday cottage areas, burning has taken place without any incidents, although great care was taken to inform the local people about the action.

In areas where the terrain is very flat, cutting and removing unwanted vegetation was done using tractor mounted harvesters. In some areas, all the vegetation had to be cut, but in most of the selected areas a mosaic pattern was applied, meaning that only about 20% of the area was directly cut.

In some cases, land swaps had to be arranged in order to make certain areas accessible for management activities. On the island of RÁ¸mÁ¸, for instance, long and narrow strips of privately owned dune heath areas on site 78 were a barrier to coherent management efforts. The Directorate of Food, Fisheries and Agricultural Business (DFFE) under the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries had holdings on the island outside of the target area, and agreed to acquire the private lots as part of a larger land consolidation scheme. Twenty different private owners were involved, and the transactions were complicated and time consuming. DFFE arranged to swap the lots inside the management area with holdings outside, and then the National Forest and Nature Agency purchased these lots from DFFE. Once these transactions had been completed, management activities could be conducted on the newly acquired land.

Public outreach and awareness activities were important throughout the project as a means of communicating project objectives, activities, and outcomes. Map tables with information about the dune heath habitats in general, and the specific site in particular, were set up on 30 locations to help educate the public. The project website was created at the beginning of the project, and was used for publishing reports, news and other materials. At the end of the project, a layman's report was produced to make relevant information and findings accessible to non-experts. Throughout the project, local newspapers often published special stories about project activities, and several guided tours of the sites were conducted. A video was also produced in association with the project in order to disseminate information to a wider audience. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The successes and failures of methodologies applied in this project will not be entirely clear until some years after the project end date. However, the monitoring reports from the intensive as well as the extensive monitoring activities indicate that the methods applied have generally had a positive impact on the conservation status of the dune heath areas involved in project activities. Three hundred eighty-eight hectares of plantations, 516 hectares of dense overgrowth, and 4,972 hectares of tree encroachment areas were cleared of invasive vegetation and non-indigenous trees as a direct result of the project. Furthermore, grazing, burning and cutting were also carried out on 2,909 hectares. At the time of its completion, the project had managed to restore a larger area than was originally projected.

Bufo calamita has started breeding in, and has thus successfully colonized, two new breeding ponds at GrÁ¦rup Strand (site 73). The species has also colonised an area at Lodbjerg (site 184) where the vegetation was removed, although without breeding success thus far. Rana arvalis is successfully breeding in large numbers at site 184 and site 26 where the vegetation has been mowed, and at site 185 and 78 where grazing has been introduced. Furthermore, Triturus cristatus has been found breeding on site 184 in an area where the vegetation has been cut down around a small pond. This habitat is a bit unusual for the species, but it is hoped that the population will remain there. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Obstacles encountered in the implementation of management strategies were primarily of an administrative character and generally beyond the control of the project management. The interface with property owners at or near the designated sites proved especially difficult, as land use issues repeatedly stalled project activities. In general, private landowners were reluctant to enter into management agreements, and this led to withdrawal of project areas on several sites. At site 72, Lyngbo Hede, the restoration of natural hydrology through the filling of the drainage trench was repeatedly delayed by disputes with property owners who feared that their cottages would be adversely affected. Elsewhere, property owners were reluctant to give their consent for tree felling, as they feared a reduction in trees would result in less deer, and thus less income from hunting licenses. Finally, securing the cooperation of livestock owners in restorative methods involving grazing was difficult at times, as EU subsidy reforms introduced during the project's implementation resulted in unforeseen changes in local economic patterns.

Despite these difficulties, however, many property owners were encouraged by project activities and volunteered to enlarge the management areas beyond what had been previously pledged. Furthermore, there were some cases in which landowners who had not participated initially approached project practitioners and asked to have their properties included.  For instance, a private fund that owns large nature areas with the specific purpose of nature conservation and animal protection (Aage V. Jensens Fond), actively asked for the inclusion of additional dune heath areas in the project activities on site 2 (RÁ¥bjerg Mile). Overall, the withdrawal of some privately owned areas was more than compensated for by the inclusion of other areas, both private and state owned.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The Danish coastline bordering the North Sea is famed for its long stretches of white sandy beaches and extensive dunes. Consequently, income from tourism is becoming more and more important in this area, as many people visit the Danish west coast with the purpose of experiencing the vast open areas and unspoiled nature. In fact, two of the Natura 2000 sites included in the project (184 and 26) are part of the area currently being considered in political discussions for designation as one of the first Danish national parks, which is to be established in 2008. A socio-economic analysis conducted in connection with the development of the proposal indicates that establishment of a national park in the area will have significant income generating effects, particularly in the tourism sector. With this potential for tourist revenue in mind, the rehabilitation of dune habitats can be seen as an investment for local agencies and individuals.
The methodologies applied in this project are innovative and have already been used in other dune heath areas–private as well as state-owned, and both inside and outside of Natura 2000 areas. Methods of clearing plantations and mosaic burning have attracted international interest among relevant authorities, and a cooperative exchange has been established between Dutch and Swedish entities. Vigorous new growth of Pinus mugo has been found in parts of the mechanically cleared and burnt areas, which underlines the need for a fast and consistent follow-up of the clearing work already carried out. If conservation work in the form of the removal of new growth of Pinus mugo (which can be carried out by hand) is not implemented within the next few years, the extensive clearing work will have been wasted.
It is deemed that annual inspection and clearing will be necessary for a 5-year period after the first major clearing. It will subsequently be possible to reduce the frequency of inspection and clearing to every three to five years.
It is recommended to continue monitoring of the habitat in the areas based on the previously laid out permanent sampling areas and transects. In this way it will be possible to assess whether the vegetation dynamics are developing as expected, and the need for any conservation measures in order to achieve the goals for the Atlantic coastal heath habitat can be continuously evaluated.
Due to the difficulties experienced in getting grazing agreements with stockowners, some areas where grazing would be the optimal management activity may have to be managed through mosaic burning and mowing instead. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/portugal-leirosa-coastal-dune-restoration/	Portugal: Leirosa Coastal Dune Restoration	Portugal	2000-03-27	2007-12-27	"The Leirosa sand dunes on Portugal’s central Atlantic coast were damaged in 1995 with the construction of a pipeline for industrial effluent. A restoration project was begun in the spring of 2000, and the dunes were reconstructed using the Artificially Inseminated Dune System (AIDS) method. Once rebuilt, dunes were planted with Ammophila arenaria transplants from a nearby donor site, and the site exhibited favorable rates of recovery during initial monitoring activities. In the winter of 2001, however, a severe winter storm destroyed the oceanic side of the restored dunes, and a new restoration project had to be implemented in 2005. After the destruction from the storm, practitioners decided to employ a more durable dune stabilization method, and geotextiles were used to reconstruct the dunes. Once again, Ammophila arenaria was transplanted at the site, and monitoring efforts to date have shown high rates of survival and recruitment of other plant species. In 2006, several geotextile units opened unexpectedly after unusually high tides, causing part of the dune to collapse. Plans are currently being made for another stabilization attempt using geotextile tubes designed with more reliable joints.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The Leirosa sand dune system was damaged as a result of construction on a submarine outfall pipeline for two nearby industries. Heavy machinery was used to excavate a channel for the new pipeline across 80 meters of dune area. This disturbance, along with continuing erosion caused by a breakwater 1 kilometer north of the site, necessitated the partial reconstruction and revegetation of the dunes in March 2000. In the winter of 2001, just months after the successful completion of this rehabilitation project, a severe storm completely destroyed the oceanic side of the newly rebuilt sand dune. To restore and stabilize the Leirosa sand dune system

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The dune system is the natural protection for the deaeration and load chamber of the outfall pipe installed to channel effluent from operations at Celulose Beira Industrial (CELBI), S.A. and Portucel Soporcel, two local industries. Because the dunes play such an important role in the hydrologic system that allows for the proper discharge of effluents, these two industries are the primary stakeholders in this project.

Description of Project Activities: PHASE 1 (2000)

The rehabilitation of the Leirosa sand dunes began in March 2000 with the mechanical reconstruction of the dunes in a process known as AIDS--Artificially Inseminated Dune System (Carter, 1995). This process allows for the reconstruction of dunes to desired heights and slopes in a relatively short period of time. For three weeks, sand was brought from a close inland site, and the foredune of the Leirosa system was rebuilt in an extension of about 200 m. The sand used for the reconstruction was very similar in texture and nutrient content to the sand already found on the Leirosa dunes. In an attempt to help control erosion, a walkover with stairs was constructed on the dunes to allow people access to the beach. A fence made of pine planks was also constructed across the top of the dunes to help control human traffic. Planks were placed 8 cm apart to create the 50% porosity advised for projects such as this (Dewhurst, 1999).

With the sand accretion phase complete, revegetation with transplants of Ammophila arenaria (L.) Link was conducted in order to help stabilize the dune system further. A. arenaria is widely used on the European coast for this type of revegetation, as it is easy to collect, transplant and propagate rapidly (van der Putten, 1990). Its complex root and rhizome system help stabilize loose sand and thereby protect against coastal erosion.

Dune plants are not commercially available in Portugal, and therefore transplants for this project were taken from well-preserved dune systems at Osso da Baleia, a few kilometers south of Leirosa. Plants were collected manually, using vertical spades to gather as much root material as possible. A dispersed pattern was used, removing individual plants at intervals not closer than 50 cm in order to minimize the impact caused to the system. Plants were collected in the morning and stored in large plastic bags with wet sand in the bottom. Transplanting in the Leirosa dunes was done every afternoon, so that plants would not be stored overnight. With small shovels, holes of about 20cm-depth were made, and after adding a very small amount of fertilizer, one or two shoots of Ammophila arenaria were dibbled. Since the slope of the dune was rather steep, a close pattern of 50 cm in a diagonal grid was chosen for the revegetation. The transplants were only placed where no other vegetation previously existed. The slow-release grain fertilizer ""Osmocote"" was used, but no more than 100 Kg/ha was deployed (Seliskar, 1995).

Revegetation began in the last week of April and lasted for approximately five weeks. Adjacent areas were also revegetated in an attempt to recover the complete system The Spring of 2000 was characterized by heavy rain in March and April, and this made for humid soil that proved a great advantage to the transplants' adaptation.

Monitoring activities commenced in June 2000 and aimed to characterize and quantify the evolution of the dune system. The restored area was divided into continental and oceanic sides, in order to determine the efficiency of plant recovery in both sides of the foredune, and transects perpendicular to the coastline were established. All aspects related to the individual shoots of A. arenaria were documented, as was the appearance of any new species. Graduated wooden poles were also placed at intervals over the dune to measure sand mobility.

PHASE 2 (2005)

After a severe winter storm in 2001 destroyed the entire seaward side of the newly restored dune, the decision was made to install geotextiles as a means of providing more durable protection from future disturbances. 

Geotextiles were installed along a 120-meter extension of the coast. A defense was created on the front bottom of the dune, at the +2.0 level (hydrographic zero), with sand containers about 6.40 meters in length, 3.20 meters in width and 0.825 meters in height placed in a pyramidal position parallel to the coastline. The protection barrier was constructed to the height of 8 meters using several layers of sand involved in geotextiles, in a so called ""wrap around technique"", which encapsulates the sand and offers a high installation speed. The upper layer has a geotextile revetment in all the area, with about 8.60-meter length, 4.30-meter width and 1.10-meter height. On the top of the geotextiles, a 1-meter layer of sand was deposited, and Ammophila arenaria transplants were introduced into this layer.

The revegetation procedure was similar in all respects to that which was conducted in 2001, except that transplants had to be watered this time. The revegetation work occurred in an area of 3000 m2, and it was conducted by four experienced gardeners over three weeks. It started in March/April to allow the complex root and rhizome system of A. arenaria to better develop before the beginning of the next winter period. Although it is not very common and necessary to water the dune systems when revegetation is performed, some irrigation was included this time due to the very dry winter of 2004/05. A container with a 4000-liter capacity was used to moisten the sand before transplantation, at the beginning of every working week.

Monitoring activities associated with this phase of the restoration were similar to those conducted under the earlier phase. All aspects of the transplants' development were recorded, along with patterns of sand mobility, as indicated by the graduated wooden measuring poles. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The initial restoration and revegetation (2000) resulted in a total of 23,250 A. arenaria transplants,17,200 on the continental side and the remainder on the oceanic side. After 4 months, a survival rate of 40% was observed, which is considered a significantly high rate of success (Dewurhst, 1999). During the summer months immediately following plantation, a decrease in the number of green plants was documented. However, this decrease was most likely due to hot weather, as the number of green plants began to rise again in September, indicating that plants had not actually died but were just subjected to stress from transplanting and weather conditions.

The reconstruction of the foredune allowed a stabilized ecosystem in the back, aided by almost nonexistent sand mobility. A similar situation did not occur in the oceanic side, where significant sand accumulation was found during the first phase of the monitoring program.

With the passing of the winter storm in 2001 and the near-total destruction of the oceanic side of the dune, monitoring activities continued on the continental side. While intensified erosion from the loss of sand and plant cover was observed on the oceanic side, results on the continental side were encouraging. A stable dune was formed in little more than one year, and 13 plant species were identified in March 2001, including Ammophila arenaria. In March 2002, the number of species had more than doubled, totaling 32. Plant cover during this monitoring period was estimated at an average of 42.8% in the established plots. This figure is significantly high when one takes into consideration that revegetation was concluded only one year prior, and that the storm destroyed part of the rehabilitated dune.

After the installation of the geotextiles in 2005, monitoring activities resumed, employing the same methodology as those already mentioned. In only six months, eleven plant species had colonized an area where only Ammophila arenaria was planted: Artemisia maritima, Calystegia soldanella, Crucianella maritime, Pancratium maritimum, Elymus farctus, Medicago marina, Silene littorea, Eryngium maritimum, Polygonum maritimum and Euphorbia paralias. Sand mobility was again evaluated using graduated wooden poles arrayed along tansects on the top back, top front and base of the dune. After six months, some distinctions were noted between the three defined zones, namely that little or no mobility occurred on the top of the dune while accumulations of about 4 to 6 cm of sand were observed at the base of the dune. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The first and most notable factor limiting the recovery of the dune system is the winter storm of February 2001 that completely destroyed the oceanic side of the newly rehabilitated dunes and rendered that earlier project futile. 

More recently, problems have arisen with some of the geotextile units. In March 2006, several units in the bottom three layers of the dune came open after high tides and the resulting hydrodynamic pressure. The opened areas allowed an outflow of the sand fill material, which precipitated a partial collapse of the dune structure and a settling of geotextiles from the top five layers. The cause of this breach is thought to be inappropriate sealing of the geotextile layers, which was done partly in conditions of high humidity.
It has been shown that the use of geotextiles can be as effective as any so called “hard engineering protection,” with the added advantage of being adaptable to the morphology of the dune system and using locally available sand (Bleck et al., 2003). Furthermore, this method saves time and money, and its visual impact is considerably less than other coastal protection measures such as stone revetments and seawalls. This was the first project in Portugal to use geotextiles for dune protection, and the technique was found to be complementary to revegetation efforts and potentially useful in other dune systems with similar erosion problems. The next step will be the rehabilitation of the geotextile-reinforced sand dune in the areas where the encapsulated sand layers have partially opened up. A proposal is currently being considered for rehabilitation with large geotextile tubes (which are prefabricated to avoid failure of the joints) filled with a suspension of sand and water and placed at the bottom of the existing structure as toe protection.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-texas-west-galveston-bay-seagrass-restoration/	USA: Texas: West Galveston Bay Seagrass Restoration	United States of America	1994-04-26	1995-09-26	"In spring 1994, 2.5 acres (1 hectare) of Halodule wrightii (shoal grass) were planted at two sites in West Galveston Bay using donor plants from eastern and western Matagorda Bay. This project was intended as a pilot project to guide the eventual restoration of over 567 hectares of submerged aquatic vegetation in Galveston Bay under the Galveston Bay Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan. As such, it examined the effects of planting depth, planting density, and fertilizer application on the survival of transplanted Halodule. While one of the planting sites–Snake Island Cove–experienced a complete die-off within one year, the other–Redfish Cove–exhibited high rates of success (especially in shallower areas of the site), and has since expanded to cover four additional acres through natural propagation. In fact, this site was used in 1999 as a donor site for another planting project in West Galveston Bay.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry In the western portion of the Galveston Bay estuary, seagrass acreage declined from 890 hectares (2200 acres) in 1956 to zero by 1989. Most of these seagrass meadows (primarily shoal grass, Halodule wrightii) grew along the barrier island edges of western West Bay. The only remaining seagrass beds (about 36 hectares or 89 acres) still in existence are found in Christmas Bay, a semi-isolated embayment adjoining West Bay. Seagrass loss has been attributed primarily to direct and indirect effects of dredging activities, wastewater discharges, increased turbidity, increased wave action after bulkheading, and unidentified point-source pollution. The West Galveston Bay segment is a moderate-salinity (mesohaline) area, and true seagrasses–consisting of predominately shoal grass (Halodule wrightii)–formerly occurred in this part of the bay system, both along the back side of Galveston Island and on the northern shoreline along the mainland. Based on historical photoanalysis, about 458 ha (1,132 acres) of shoal grass were estimated along the back side of Galveston Island during 1956, and 125 ha (308 acres) estimated during 1965 (Pulich and White, 1991). In 1975 photographs, only 37 ha (91 acres) of shoal grass beds were visible in the 3.6-km (2-mi) shoreline section just north of San Luis Pass. Wigeon grass had always been found mixed in with these shoal grass beds and continued to be found sporadically in some shoreline areas of Galveston Island after 1979.
Christmas and Drum Bays contain well-developed, polyhaline seagrass communities, including predominately shoal grass and star grass, and some turtle grass. This area represents the northernmost location for turtle grass on the Texas coast and is somewhat of a distribution anomaly because the closest known population is far to the south in Aransas Bay near Rockport.
Since the late 1950s, seagrass vegetation in upper Galveston and Trinity Bays (excluding the Trinity River delta) has consisted entirely of wigeon grass beds. There are anecdotal reports that shoal grass occurred there in the first half of the 1900s, but these reports are unconfirmed. In West Galveston Bay, shoal grass has historically been the predominant seagrass. In certain seasons, however, particularly in spring, localized grassbeds will contain some wigeon grass. As mentioned previously, a few small patches of turtle grass also occurred at the lower end of Galveston Island near San Luis Pass up until the late 1970s. These patches were interspersed in the large beds dominated by shoal grass. The goal of this project was to determine whether small-scale restorations in West Bay resulted in viable Halodule habitat, and to thereby determine the feasibility of the proposed large-scale restoration of Halodule beds in Galveston Bay under the Galveston Bay Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
This was a pilot project intended to assess the feasibility of large-scale seagrass restoration in Galveston Bay, as proposed by the Galveston Bay Estuary Program. As such, its primary stakeholders are the Estuary Program’s partners and member organizations, which include local, state, and federal governments, business, industry, universities, conservation organizations, bay user groups, and private citizens.

Description of Project Activities: Restoration was attempted at two sites on western Galveston Island. One bed was planted at Redfish Cove (29Âº06'15.9""N, 95Âº06'30.9""W), and two beds (East and West) were planted at Snake Island Cove (29Âº09'21.4""N, 95Âº01'58.5""W).

Halodule transplanting units (TPUs) were collected from donor beds in Matagorda Bay near the towns of Palacios and Port O'Connor, Texas, approximately 15 km apart and 150 km southwest of West Bay. A total of 3500 TPUs was removed from the Palacios bed and transported to Redfish Cove during 26-28 April 1994. Another 7100 TPUs were removed from the Port O'Connor bed and transported to Snake Island Cove during 3-5 and 10-12 May 1994.

TPUs were prepared by the peat pot method developed by Fonseca (1994). A 7.5cm-diameter circular sod plugger was used to extract Halodule from donor beds. Each plug was then inserted directly into a 7.5cm-diameter peat pot. Time-release fertilizer (Osmocote: 14% N, 14% P, 14% K; 5.25g +/- 0.14 SE, n = 10) was added to all but 1200 TPUs from Port O'Connor prior to insertion of Halodule plugs. TPUs were placed in seawater-filled holding tanks and covered with wet burlap to prevent desiccation during transport. Once at the transplant site, the sod plugger was used to create holes into which TPUs were placed, after the sides of the peat pots were ripped to allow rhizome propagation (spread from the original TPU).

Individual transplant beds ecompassed 62m x 42m and were arrayed perpendicular to the shoreline at the low-water mark observed after passage of a strong cold front in December 1993. The perimeter of each bed was marked by galvanized fence posts every 2m and was surrounded by 1.2m- high black plastic screen with 10mm x 16mm mesh during the first week of April 1994. This mesh size was expected to exclude all but the smallest of the local fishes and decapods, several species of which could affect transplant success through disturbance or herbivory (Fonseca 1994; Hammerstrom et al. 1998). After fencing, each bed was swept from the seaward edge to the landward access gate with a 75m-wide, 10mm mesh seine to force large organisms out; then the gate was closed.

Snake Island East and West were constructed 20m apart and 9km northeast of Redfish Cove. Each bed received TPUs arranged in three 8m x 54m strips. Within each strip, we delineated areas representing combinations of three planting densities (high = 0.25m centers; medium = 0.5m centers; low = 1.0 m centers) and three relative water depth ranges (shallow, medium, and deep). Within each strip, TPUs were planted along marked guidelines as follows: 40 rows at 9 TPUs per row on 1.0 m centers (360 TPUs); 24 rows at 17 TPUs per row on 0.5 m centers (408 TPUs); and 12 rows at 33 TPUs per row on 0.25m centers (396 TPUs). Thus, 3492 TPUs were placed into each bed and 10,476 TPUs were placed overall. A fourth 8m x 54m strip within each bed was left bare as a control to monitor natural recruitment.

Transplanted and natural grassbeds were examined monthly during June-October 1994 and in April, June, and September 1995. Halodule survival and propagation were determined by snorkeling over randomly chosen rows of TPUs at each site. TPUs were scored as live (presence of green leaves) or dead (no leaves apparent), and live TPUs were scored as propagating (rhizomes extending beyond the original TPU) or dormant (no rhizomes outside of the original TPU). In addition, we swam transects across control sections to determine whether these areas remained nonvegetated. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Coverage in restored beds was significantly lower than that of Christmas Bay--the natural control site--except in September 1994 when the coverage at Redfish Cove equaled that of the natural bed. Moreover, coverage was significantly higher at Redfish Cove than at either Snake Island bed in all months except June 1994.

No recruitment of Halodule into the control areas at either site was observed at any time during the initial monitoring period. However, More than 75% of all TPUs showed signs of rhizome propagation outside the peat pots by the end of the first growing season. Production of new shoots (i.e. those located outside the original TPUs) was significantly related to site, planting density, and water depth. New shoot densities (number per unit area) at the transplant sites were significantly lower than those in natural seagrass beds, except in September 1994 when Redfish Cove densities equaled those at Christmas Bay East. New-shoot densities at Redfish Cove were also significantly higher than those at Snake Island East and West in September 1994 and in June and September 1995. High-density plantings produced significantly higher numbers of new shoots than did medium- and low-density plantings in all but the first and last months. Shallow plantings produced higher new-shoot densities than did medium and deep plantings, significantly so in September and October 1994 and June 1995.

Survival was significantly higher at Redfish Cove in late 1994 and in 1995 than at either Snake Island bed. Survival at Redfish Cove was 70% by September 1995, while almost all transplants at Snake Island Cove had died by then. The deterioration at Snake Island was a two-stage process that began at the end of the growing season in 1994, when average survival declined from 84% in August to 56% in September and October. Survival stabilized at that level through June 1995, but then the decline increased through September 1995, resulting in a complete loss at Snake Island East and only 6% survival at Snake Island West. 

We estimate that the total area covered by Halodule at Redfish Cove, including surviving TPUs, was 1014 mÂ² as of June 1996. Halodule coverage ranged from solid to patchy, with isolated patches as small as 2.3 mÂ². Site maps indicate a loss of deeper water areas but stability and expansion of the shallowest region. In fact, the Redfish Cove site has now become permanently established, and a 0.4-ha (1-acre) initial bed has expanded to cover an area of about 2 ha (5 acres). This bed was used in 1999 as a donor site and seemed to recover most of its shallow vegetated area by the 2000 survey. Seagrass shoot densities remain below those of Christmas Bay, but root and rhizome biomass has been similar to that of Christmas Bay in all years. During the 1994-1997 monitoring period, densities of fishes, shrimps, crabs, and benthos (e.g. worms, clams, and small crustaceans) in the planted bed were below densities found in natural seagrass of Christmas Bay but above those observed in adjacent unplanted sands. Since 1998, volunteer beds have begun growing west of the experimental site and may be a result of propagules breaking off of the planted beds. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Halodule survival, coverage, and new shoot densities were affected by site, planting density, and water depth. Planted beds at Redfish Cove exhibited favorable rates of success, while those at Snake Island Cove failed completely. Analysis of various factors influencing the dynamics of this die-off at Snake Island suggests that water quality and sedimentation were the primary factors, and that water column light conditions, salinity, and eutrophic conditions were less influential (Sheridan and others, 1998). Planting density also proved of considerable importance to the ultimate success of the planted beds. In September and October 1994 and in April 1995, survival of high-density transplants was significantly greater than that of medium- and low-density plantings; and in July and September 1995, survival of both high- and medium-density plantings significantly exceeded that of low-density beds. Indeed, success rates were significantly higher when planted on 0.25-m or 0.5-m centers rather than on 1.0-m centers, and propagation (spreading from transplant units) was also greater from 0.25-m or 0.5-m center plantings. Finally, water depth was of considerable import in the long-term viability of newly planted beds. Survival in shallow sections often significantly exceeded that in middle depths, and was always significantly greater than in deep sections.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Successful restoration of seagrass beds will increase habitat for species of commercial and recreational importance such as penaeid shrimp, blue crab, and spotted sea trout, as well as their prey, and it will also stabilize shorelines and slow erosion.
There are several recommendations to be made concerning transplanting seagrasses into the Galveston Bay Estuary. Given that we do not know much about the physical, chemical, and biological status of specific restoration sites, it would benefit resource agencies to conduct various screening tests (including the planting of small experimental beds) prior to full-scale restoration at any given site in West Bay. These tests should help avoid the catastrophic failure we found in Snake Island Cove. Reconnaissance of potential chemical contaminants such as biocides or hydrocarbons in sediments and water along the remaining undeveloped shoreline needs to be conducted, as do assessments of sediment nutrient chemistry with reference to possible nutrient limitation. Current velocities should be examined during times of maximum tidal ranges, particularly if widely spaced plantings (e.g. 1.0m centers) are anticipated. An array of light meters should be deployed at each site to estimate maximum depth limits for transplants. Once a potential planting site passes these screening criteria, test plantings on the order of 100 mÂ² beds should be installed and monitored for at least two growing seasons.
Our experiments and those of Fonseca et al. (1994, 1996a) and Hammerstrom et al. (1998) indicate that, once final sites are delimited, transplanting should be conducted during spring months on 0.25m or 0.5 m centers, in relatively shallow water, by the peat pot method, and including time-release fertilizer. These techniques have proven to be cost-effective and should foster the rapid growth and coalescence of seagrasses and thus long-term resistance to physical and biotic disturbances in West Bay. The results of this project will be used by the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission’s Galveston Bay Program to plan and conduct further seagrass restoration actions, with a goal of restoring 567 hectares (1400 acres) of submerged aquatic vegetation in 10 years.

A signature species of the Delaware Estuary and a commercially important fishery, the once-abundant Eastern oyster has experienced serious population declines as a result of over harvesting and Dermo disease. With congressional support and federal funding, the task force coordinated the planting of more than 280,000 bushels of ocean quahog, surf clam and Maryland oyster shells at several sites in New Jersey and Delaware in the summer of 2005. Between June and July 2007, an additional 550,000 bushels of clam shells will be planted at existing oyster beds in an attempt to build on past successes. These planting efforts are ultimately aimed at addressing the issue of low larvae recruitment in existing beds and at stabilizing oyster populations in the bay in order to revive the oyster industry in surrounding communities.Fisheries & Aquaculture, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Between one and two million bushels of eastern oysters were harvested every year during the 1930s, when the population initially began to decline. The introduction of the oyster disease MSX in the 1950s, followed in the 1990s by a second disease, Dermo, has resulted in a further decline in the oyster population. Today, the oyster population is feeling the effects of five years of below-average biological recruitment for reasons that are not known. Other than the American oyster (C. virginica), notable benthic aquatic organisms in Delaware Bay include the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) and the horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus). Other commonly occurring species are Tellina agilis (bivalve), Ensis directus (bivalve), Glycera dibranchiate (polychaete), Heteromastus filimformis (polychaete), Gemma gemma (bivalve), Nethtys picta (polychaete), Mulinia lateralis (bivalve), Neomysis americana (crustacean), Nucula proxima (bivalve), and
Protohaustorius wegleyi (crustacean). Hard clams (Mercenaria) are distributed from Port Mahon to Cape Henlopen. The blue crab (C. sapidus) is ubiquitous in Delaware Bay and functions as a predator in the estuarine ecosystem. Horseshoe crabs (L. polyphemus) are ancient arthropods that play a very prominent and vital role in Delaware Bay. Each spring, horseshoe crabs migrate into the bay to spawn within the intertidal zone of sandy beaches. Eggs are laid in tightly bundled clumps in nests dug 2-8 inches below the sand surface. The high concentration of horseshow crab eggs is vital to migratory shorebirds, who feed on the eggs, unintentionally excavated by other spawning horseshoe crabs, to fuel the remainder of their trip to Arctic nesting grounds.
The Delaware estuary is also home to over 100 species of finfish, many of which are commercially and recreationally important. This great diversity is the result of the overlap between northern and southern species in the mid-Atlantic coastal region. Many species use the estuary as a breeding ground and nursery area for their young. The warm, shallow, near-shore and marsh nursery waters shelter small fish from predators and provide them with food while the deeper, cooler waters serve as feeding grounds for larger fish. The majority of adult fish species in the Delaware estuary are predators at or near the top of the food web, eating plankton, smaller fish, and invertebrates such as crabs, snails, and worms. Abundant finfish species in the bay include the red hake (Urophycis chuss), northern sea robin (Prionotus carolinus), spot (Leiostomus xanthurus), windowpane flounder (Scopthalmus aquosus), silver hake (Merluccuns bilinearis), bluefish (Pomatomis saltatrix), croaker (Pogonias cromis), summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), clearnose skate (Raja eglanteria), hogchoker (Trinectes maculates), and weakfish (Cynocion regalus). Many of these species use oyster beds as a source of food and are directly dependent on the maintenance of shell surface area to support the food resources important to their survival.
The Delaware Bay ecosystem is also important for several endangered species. The shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum), an endangered fish species, migrates through parts of the bay in the spring to spawn in the upper estuary. Sea turtles, especially the loggerhead (Caretta caretta), the Kemp’s ridley (Lepidochelys kempii), green (Chelonia mydes), and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) may occur in the lower Delaware Bay from June to November. Six species of endangered whales have been observed migrating along the Atlantic Coast, and are occasionally seen in the lower bay. These whales include the sperm whale (Physeter catadon), fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis), and black right whale (Balaena glacialis). The goal of this project is the complete revitalization of Delaware Bay oysters and the industry that once thrived upon them. The annual harvest goal by the year 2009 is between 200,000 and 400,000 bushels. (In 2004, by comparison, the oyster industry was allocated only 100,000 bushels.)

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The members of the Delaware Bay Oyster Restoration Task Force–as well as their constituents and affiliates–are stakeholders in this project, as are the communities around the bay that depend on the oyster industry for their livelihood.

Description of Project Activities: During the summer of 2005, the Delaware Bay Oyster Restoration Task Force initiated a large-scale oyster shell-planting and transplant program using 280,000 bushels of shell (approximately 10,500 tons) spread over 150 acres. The program consisted of six shell plants in New Jersey and two shell plants in Delaware. Three types of shell were planted: surf clam shell obtained from New Jersey shucking houses, ocean quahog shell obtained from New Jersey shucking houses, and Maryland oyster shell obtained from shell mining operations in Chesapeake Bay.

Shell planting was carried out in July 2005. Three 25-acre grids received direct plants in New Jersey: Shell Rock 4, 12, and 43. A fourth plant off Reed's Beach was moved up bay in September to Bennies Sand 11. All three types of shell were planted in New Jersey--surf clam, quahog, and oyster. In Delaware, two 25-acre areas were planted, one on the Jigger Hill bed and the other on the Lower Middle bed. Maryland oyster shell was planted in both areas, and ocean quahog shell was also planted on Lower Middle. 

With the new substrate in place, recruitment estimates were obtained via three sampling sources. In October, samples were taken by oyster dredge in survey mode as a component of the oyster stock assessment program. In October, diver samples were obtained as a component of the dredge calibration program. In early November, samples were obtained by scientific dredge as part of the growth and mortality monitoring program. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The 2005 planting effort yielded a 10% increase in oyster recruitment despite an overall population decline in areas outside the seed beds. It is thus concluded that recruitment enhancement programs were successful.

In New Jersey, where a quantitative evaluation is easier, the shell plants raised the ratio of spat to oyster on Shell Rock from 0.471 to 0.991 and on the high mortality beds (Bennies Sand, Bennies, New Beds, Ledge, Egg Island, Vexton, Nantuxent Point, Beadons, Hog Shoal, Strawberry, and Hawk's Nest) from 0.808 to 0.905. This latter was accomplished even though only one high mortality bed, Bennies Sand, received a shell plant. In the 53-year history of the New Jersey survey, a bay-wide set exceeding 1 spat per oyster has happened only 17 times. Values above 0.5 generally are associated with stock expansion. Consequently, the ratios achieved on these two beds are substantive.

Shell planting in New Jersey in 2005 enhanced recruitment by 10%, even though the total area planted was a mere 100 acres. On Shell Rock, shell plants accounted for 52.4% of total recruitment. On the high mortality beds, the single shell plant on Bennies Sand 11 accounted for 10.7% of total recruitment.

Comparisons in Delaware can only be made on a per bushel basis. Nevertheless, data from the Delaware survey indicates that shell planting successfully enhanced recruitment. The average spat/bushel, based on 15 samples, for the Ridge/Jigger Hill area was 8.1. The average spat/bushel, based on 6 samples, for the Lower Middle bed was 23.3. Whereas the average spat/bushel for all Delaware beds was 14.5 (+/- 3.53), the shell plants yielded an average of 43 spat/bushel. This represents at least three times the bay average, and it is likely an underestimate given the difficulty of tracking results for the Maryland oyster shell. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Recruitment rates were lower in Delaware, and this is due, to some extent, to more concentrated shell planting and to the reliance on Maryland oyster shell. On Upper Middle, the lower recruitment rate is likely explained by the fact that oyster shell was planted more thickly here than elsewhere to build up bed integrity. Elsewhere in Delaware, ocean quahog shell was planted as a base for a cover of Maryland oyster shell. Therefore, ocean quahog shell did not obtain the recruitment success of other plants, even though it was shown to be equally as effective as surf clam shell in facilitating settlement. Maryland oyster shell tended to be lower in total spat catch across the planting sites, but this may have been due to a couple of factors: (a) the lateness of planting and/or (b) the difficulty in tracking planted shells. This difficulty arose because as time went on, the Maryland oyster shell lost its original unique appearance. Final numbers for the Maryland shell plants are therefore less precise and are most likely underestimated in comparison to the clam shell plants. Even in light of these intervening factors, though, evidence suggests that the recruitment rate in Delaware waters in 2005 was lower overall. 

Another factor that will ultimately limit the recovery of oysters at the planting sites is an increasing trend in natural mortality from Dermo disease. Dermo prevalence in the area of the bay used for shell planting is typically above 50%. Although the impact of disease on the animals obtained from shell plants cannot yet be determined, the data suggest that an average exposure will occur and that mortality from Dermo will be observed among newly recruited oysters.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Over time, the shell-planting and transplant program currently underway in Delaware Bay could increase oyster production to between 200,000 and 400,000 bushels per year. According to projections, the restoration project will generate $50 for every $1 invested during its first harvests in 2008 and 2009. If project goals are realized, the potential economic impact of a revitalized oyster industry would constitute as much as $60 million between the two states. This revenue would not only help revitalize and sustain the oyster population in the future; it would also represent a much-needed boost for the livelihood of many coastal communities dependent upon the resource.
This project is ongoing, and continuing planting efforts and monitoring activities are anticipated. In fact, 550,000 bushels of clean clam shells will be placed on existing oyster beds between June and July 2007. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/antigua-maiden-island-total-reef-restoration/	Antigua: Maiden Island Total Reef Restoration	Antigua & Barbuda	2003-11-21	2004-03-21	"Stanford Development Company Ltd. (SDC) and the Reef Ball Foundation, Inc. recently conducted the world’s largest total marine ecosystem restoration, which included both coral reef and mangrove habitats. Approximately 3,500 Reef Balls, prefabricated concrete modules designed to mimic natural reefs, were installed around Maiden Island on both its windward and leeward sides. On the windward side of the island, 1,200 Reef Balls were used to create the world’s largest fringing breakwater reef system.Constructed in just 2 months, the reef system was planted with live corals salvaged from a future dredging site and then propagated using innovative new methods. In all, 5,000 new coral colonies, including threatened Staghorn (A. cervicornis) and Elkhorn corals (A. Palmata), were permanently attached to adapters in the Reef Balls to form a functioning reef. On the leeward side of the island, an integrated restoration was designed in which 2,000 Reef Balls were deployed to create a breakwater reef, and more than 4,200 red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) seedlings were planted along the shoreline. Because mangroves are so important for the health of coastal ecosystems–e.g. shoreline stabilization, habitat for juvenile fish and other marine life, and filtration of pollutants from incoming fresh water– it is hoped that this multifaceted restoration will yield greater environmental benefits than either project would if done separately.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Maiden Island’s windward reef was destroyed in 1995 when Hurricane Luis, a Category 4 hurricane, passed directly over Antigua and Barbuda. The Reef Balls will serve many purposes including protecting seagrasses from boating scars, stabilizing the island’s beaches to create better conditions for corals and other marine life (i.e. less siltation), and serving as substrate to create a richly diverse coral reef.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Over 3,500 Reef Ball modules were constructed on the Island of Antigua. One thousand two hundred of these modules were deployed from a barge on the windward side of Maiden Island to form the windward breakwater reef and dive-snorkel trail. The remaining 2,000 modules were built for the lee-side breakwater, and as part of the island's Reef Ball red mangrove planting project. Eight different sizes and over 100 different design styles of Reef Ball modules were incorporated into this project to more closely mimic a natural reef. Reef Balls were chosen because the alternative--an armor stone breakwater--would have negatively impacted thousands of square feet of seagrass beds. The Reef Balls were designed with special open bottoms to allow sea grasses to flourish around and under the modules so that conch (Strombus gigas) habitat would be preserved. The Reef Ball construction site had an average of 100 workers building Reef Ball modules 24 hours per day, 7 days a week for a period of 2 months. A special concrete mix was developed that allowed the Reef Balls to be cast and deployed rapidly (sometimes within 18 hours of being cast) while still retaining the special marine-friendly formulations that make the concrete's pH match that of natural seawater. The unique textured surface and balanced pH of the Reef Balls is designed so that coral larvae and other marine life can easily affix themselves and quickly grow into adult colonies. The Reef Ball modules were loaded onto barges by cranes, and then crews worked from sunrise to sunset deploying modules at predetermined sites. A Total Station surveying method, which is accurate to within centimeters, was used to ensure that the placement of Reef Balls did not damage existing natural corals. Before the installation of the modules, a special mark had to be established called the 'biological tide line', which is the water level at which marine growth stops. The Reef Balls were made in different sizes so that the top of each Reef Ball would be exactly at the 'biological tide line.' This placement makes for the most effective submerged breakwater, and also maximizes the biological growing surfaces for the new reef. Once the modules were deployed, the Reef Ball Foundation’s Coral Reef Propagation and Coral Reef Rescue teams (composed of experts from around the world who serve as volunteers) began collecting imperiled corals from a proposed dredging site to transplant on the new reef system. These corals were gathered and brought to the 'coral prop table,' a work station in shallow water where propagation activities were carried out. The coral is cut into small fragments and then embedded in a cement plug. Plugs are made with a special cement that contains additives to adjust the pH and a formula designed to set in less than 3 minutes. The cement is mixed with a Water/Adva Flow solution and then poured into standard 'medicine' cups with sand in the bottom to allow easy removal of the set plug. Wearing gloves which are sterilized between each new coral colony, workers insert fragmented pieces of coral into the cement and then place them back in the water after 2 minutes. Full curing occurs in about 20 minutes, and then the plug is popped out of the cup. Using a special underwater epoxy putty, divers fit the plugs into holes in the Reef Balls pre-made for this purpose. Most corals can be rescued, fragmented, plugged, and planted within a few hours, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful transplantation. Thirty different species of imperiled hard and soft corals, including 3,000 free living rose corals and literally tons of brain corals, Gorgonian soft corals, Elk Horn coral, etc., were rescued from dredge operations surrounding Maiden Island. Several species of these corals were fragmented into smaller segments (replicating natural asexual coral reproduction) including threatened Sea Fans (Gorgonia spp.), Elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata), Staghorn coral (A. cervicornis), as well as the less common Fused Staghorn (A. prolifera-robusta). Other fragmented species included Finger corals (Porites porties and P.devaricata), Pillar coral (Dendrogyra cylindricus), Diffuse Ivory Tree coral (Oculina diffusa), and Yellow Pencil coral (Madracis mirabilis), to mention a few. The Reef Ball modules were also aquascaped and planted with coral species that do not lend themselves well to fragmentation--i.e. Diploria sp., Colpophyllia sp. and Meandrina sp. Commonly referred to as brain corals, these species were established, along with Mustard Hill (Porites asteroids, etc.), anemones, desired macro algal, and sponges just to state a few. Over 500 sea urchins (Echinometra lucunter) were added to the reef to act as 'janitors' and keep the corals free from algal overgrowth. Scientifically designed larval lobster settlement substrates were also incorporated into the reef system to enhance survivability of the spiny lobster (Panulirus argus), an important species in Antigua. Finally, many of the Reef Balls were filled one-third full of rocks in order to create additional complexity and habitat for fish. Observations to date have shown this strategy to be effective, as the reef is exhibiting signs of increased juvenile fish populations. The transplanting of imperiled corals, along with the integration of live rock and other invertebrates, will greatly accelerate the formation of a biologically diverse Reef Ball restoration coral reef, thereby improving water quality and habitat. On the leeward side of the island, similar Reef Ball deployment techniques were utilized, and a total of approximately 2,000 modules were installed. Red Mangroves were also planted on this side of the island in order to enhance the marine ecosystem and complement the Reef Ball coral reef. Red Mangrove, or ‘Walking Mangrove’ (Rhizophora mangle), was chosen for use on the island because it forms extensive underwater root systems that provide important habitat for juvenile fish and other marine life. Over 4,200 Red Mangroves were imported into Antigua from Nova Southeastern University's mangrove nursery in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and another 3,000 are planned. Upon arrival in Antigua, the mangroves are placed in a special nursery area, where they are afforded an opportunity to grow somewhat and become acclimated before they are transplanted. Once transplanted, the seedlings must be stabilized and protected until they become fully established. This project employed small, prefabricated Reef Balls as underwater “pots,” in lieu of other stabilization techniques involving PVC encasement tubes. The Reef Balls, lined with burlap to retain soil and anchored with a length of rebar, will ensure that young mangroves are not damaged or uprooted by waves before they can develop resilient roots. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: There were 11 species of fish observed on the reef during the project’s preparatory phase. The volunteer teams have since documented 73 fish species, 71 invertebrates spp., 30 corals spp., 26 algal spp., and 1 turtle on the newly restored reef. Every day the species list continues to grow (see link in references section for a detailed list). Within three weeks of being built, the reef was host to a documented spawning event of over 100 large Gray Snappers (Lutjanus griseus). Starting about two hours after sunset, these fish hover near the ocean bottom. A dominant fish (in this case a very large Gray Snapper) appears to entice this group into making rapid ascents to the surface. The fast and spectacular ascents occur almost daily and are oftentimes accompanied by an explosion of eggs and milt. This is the first documented formation of a new spawning site, and it has major implications for future fish stock management. The coral rescue and propagation effort was quite successful. Although some of the corals that were rescued had experienced stress from sedimentation, only 200 fragments were lost (out of a total of 5,000). The majority of these losses were in the Staghorn and Elkhorn families, and all of the other species had survival rates exceeding 95%. In fact, within just three weeks, many corals (including Staghorns, Elkhorns and Finger Corals) were seen ""basing,"" or growing out over the Reef Balls. This indicates the corals are healthy and will exhibit high rates of survival. Among other project successes, the following achievements were realized: 1) The creation of over 5,000 new coral colonies encompassing 30 different species 2) The rescue and transplantation of over 17.5 tons of corals from dredging operations without a single coral family loss. 3) The re-establishment of 4 new coral species lost from Maiden Island during Hurricane Luis 4) The rescue and relocation of over 3,000 (free living) rose corals. 5) The stabilization of over 9,000 pounds of loose rocks to help reduce hurricane reef damage. 6) The enhanced genetic diversity of several species of coral (e.g. Finger, Elkhorn, Staghorn, Lettuce, Brains, and soft corals) to strengthen the reef from coral diseases and man-made stresses.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Human needs were not forgotten in the construction of the reef either. Stanford Development Company and the Reef Ball Foundation created hundreds of yards of snorkeling and diving trails. These trails provide visitors a complete tour of the reef and afford a glimpse of the wondrous and abundant reef life now present. The trails are marked by Reef Balls that have a 12-inch by 12-inch square marking to make navigation easy.
This project is the world’s largest total marine ecosystem restoration, and it incorporates all of the latest successful marine restoration techniques. The whole project cost less than traditional breakwaters–which are seldom environmentally friendly–yet produced an end result with far greater beauty, usefulness and environmental sensitivity. Because coral reefs and mangroves engage in such significant biological interaction, the restoration efforts on the leeward side of the island are especially innovative. The newly created mangrove habitat will serve as a natural water filter to help maintain good water quality for the entire coastal ecosystem and will also help ensure an abundance of fish, lobster, and marine invertebrates on the new reefs. The restoration has been so successful thus far that The Antigua Department of Fisheries is now considering measures to protect the new ecosystem. Such protection may include the nearby natural reefs, mangroves stands, seagrass beds, the new spawning grounds, and genetic coral bank reserves, and would undoubtedly create more abundant fisheries in all of Antigua and more effective management of valuable natural resources. Scientists have advocated the creation of genetic coral banks, where different families from the same species are conserved, in case of a need for replanting after a hurricane or other natural disaster precipitates the loss of specific families of coral. This was done for Staghorn, and Elkhorn corals as part of this project, as these species are threatened throughout the Caribbean. There are numerous other proposals for additional long-term monitoring, reef maintenance, public education and reef protection being considered by the Stanford Development Company in association with this project. One proposal involves the addition of mooring buoys so that anchor drops do not damage the new reef. There are also efforts being made by the Reef Ball Foundation and R. Allen Stanford to designate the area as a marine protected reserve. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/indonesia-bali-pemuteran-coral-reef-restoration-project/	Indonesia: Bali: Pemuteran Coral Reef Restoration Project	Indonesia	2000-06-19	2000-06-19	"Twenty eight Biorockâ„¢ coral nursery structures have been installed in the Pemuteran Village Marine Protected Area in Northwest Bali, Indonesia, making this the largest Biorockâ„¢ coral reef nursery and restoration project worldwide. The nurseries are welded steel matrices that are electrically charged via two electrodes supplying low-voltage, direct current from an onshore site. The submerged electrodes generate electorlytic reactions that cause minerals naturally present in sea water to accumulate on the Biorockâ„¢ structures. This mineral accretion produces natural limestone–the material which also constitutes coral skeletons, reefs and sand–and fosters the settlement and rapid development of corals, coralline algae, bivalves and many other organisms. After initial success in facilitating the re-colonization of most local coral species, project practitioners expanded the restoration area and have installed additional nurseries in several phases. Seen as a way to mitigate the destruction of important fisheries and stimulate ecotourism in the region, this ongoing project is conducted with the support of the Municipality of Pemuteran, Gahawisri (the Balinese Watersports Federation), local dive shops and hotels, and other local stakeholders.Climate Change, Fisheries & Aquaculture The destruction of Bali’s coral reefs has resulted from human activities, such as dynamite and cyanide fishing, over-exploitation, and environmentally-unfriendly tourism, as well as environmental factors, such as pollution, increased turbidity, and global warming. Destructive fishing practices employing bombs and cyanide have been widely utilized in the region, as the low currents of Pemuteran Bay make it easy for fishermen to retrieve dead fish. These practices have turned offshore bank reefs that were once dense thickets of coral packed with swarms of fishes into barren piles of broken rubble.
Anthropogenic stressors have been complicated by changes in water temperature associated with climatic events. The 1998 El Nino incident, which raised water temperature worldwide, caused a phenomenon called bleaching in which the coral dies due to the increase in temperature, giving the visual effect of the reef being bleached. The impact of changing water termperatures, coupled with destructive fishing practices, has left Pemuteran’s reefs severely degraded. To increase coral growth and recruitment rates and increase the densities of reef fish by providing them with suitable natural habitat.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Pemuteran coral reefs are a vital source of livelihood for both fishermen and members of the ecotourism sector. Consequently, this restoration has been conducted in close collaboration and cooperation with local partners ranging from fishermen, divers, hotels, marine parks, environmental organizations, and community groups. An attempt is made to demonstrate the full range of factors affecting their reefs and to propose solutions and strategies for their effective management.

Description of Project Activities: The coral nursery structures are made of welded construction steel bars, mainly of 1 centimeter and 1.3 centimeter diameter. They are built in a variety of shapes. One structure, called the Nautilus, is 3.5 m high 3 m wide, and 11 m long, in the form of an ellipsoidal pyramid. Six structures, called the Flowers, consist of funnels of about 2.5 m high and 3-5 m diameter. These structures have numerous arc-like pockets along their sides. Another set of 7 structures, called the Caterpillars, are 12 m long, about 2 m wide and 2 m high, and consist of open downward and upward pointing arcs. Two structures are bamboo-steel composites, composed of 12 m horizontal bamboo logs, with steel bars driven through their length, supported by steel arc legs. One structure has a single length of bamboo, while the other consists of two such units end to end. Another structure, the Big Bamboo, is built only of bamboo, wrapped with 2 mm copper wire. Following application of electrical current, the steel structures proceed to grow a white limestone layer, providing a substrate for coral growth. While the bamboo elements are not electrically conductive, the steel bars inside them or the copper wire around them grow limestone on their surfaces, which is expected to mineralize the adjacent bamboo wood over time. Another project consists of mesh, 1.2 m wide and 25 m long, laid over the bottom. An additional project on the other side of the bay in front of Reef Seen Aquatics uses wires directly attached to corals.

All structures are charged by power supplies located at adjacent onshore sites. They are located in two enclosures at Taman Sari Hotel, in Archipelago Dive shop at Taman Sari, in the Pemuteran Village Barong Art Shop, in Yos Dive Shop at Pondok Sari Hotel, and at Reef Seen Aquatics. Electricity is donated by the operators of these facilities. The cathodic structures and anodes are connected to the power supplies by cables which are buried in the beach and laid on the sea floor. All the structures combined receive up to about 4.5 kilowatts of power annually. Many structures receive power through several cables, and all are wired to each other so that power is shared throughout, allowing them to continue operating even if their direct power cables are severed. The power supplies are wired in parallel through common buses, so that if one fails the others will take up the load. As a result of this redundant design, the system is highly robust to failure of any particular cable or power supply.

Corals were collected for transplantation onto the structures from sites in the Pemuteran area, including sites within the protected area and nearby fringing and offshore reefs. Corals were transported in large plastic buckets filled with seawater and attached to the structures as soon as possible. Most corals were simply wedged into specially designed spaces between the structural elements of the nurseries, and needed no further attachment. Other corals were attached by wires, or placed on or next to the structures.

Coral selected for transplantation consisted almost entirely of naturally broken fragments that were found lying on reef slopes or buried in mud below them. Large numbers of corals were found loose, often having had their bases undermined by boring worms, clams, and sponges. Many of these corals were previously severely damaged by abrasion or burial, often with significant fractions dead. The purpose of choosing these damaged fragments was to rescue corals that would have almost surely soon died as the result of physical injury, and to avoid damaging healthy corals whenever possible. Often only a very small fraction of the coral was left alive as a result of previous injuries, but in almost all cases these living portions proceeded to grow well after attachment. A few totally dead corals were attached because some divers involved in collection were insufficiently experienced at identifying live corals. Although the focus was on stony reef-building corals, some soft corals, sponges, tunicates, and anemones were also transplanted.

The naturally generated coral fragments most likely to be found by divers tended to be the most abundant branching corals (primarily Acroporas, Pocilloporas, Porites, and Seriatoporas). Consequently, these species tended to be over-represented in the collected transplants. A special search was made for rarer coral species unlikely to be found as natural fragments, such as massive or encrusting corals. Where these could not be found loose, small fragments were broken off and transplanted to ensure that the maximum species diversity of the area was represented. These were often taken from colonies growing near the structures. Some massive and cryptic encrusting corals found in the area were never found in sizes or shapes that could easily be broken off and transplanted, and are therefore under-represented on the structures. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: At least 66 of the 82 reef building coral genera in Indonesia (80.5%), and of the 111 genera worldwide (59.5%), are already being cultivated on the Pemuteran Coral Arks. It is likely that several more genera are also found on the nurseries but were not identified, especially cryptic encrusting species on the undersides of other coral colonies. 

Coral nurseries receiving adequate power from the submerged cables quickly turned white from mineral accretion and began to cement themselves to the reef bedrock. Almost all live coral fragments were quickly cemented in place by the accreted minerals and proceeded to grow rapidly over the Biorockâ„¢ structures. New coral skeleton growth was clearly visible in as little as a few days. Because these corals have only recently been transplanted and the power applied, it is too soon to compare detailed differences in growth rates between species; but even in the first few weeks some trends became apparent. The Acroporas and Montiporas seem to be most responsive, quickly overgrowing the mineral accretion, often completely growing around it, and rapidly forming dense arrays of new branches. Some Acropora colonies formed hundreds of new branches that grew about a centimeter in less than a month, and many corals show clear changes in growth orientation and unusually dense and compact branching after transplantation. These corals are also distinguished by very bright colors.

Following the establishment of new coral growth on the structures, fish and marine invertebrates began to be rapidly attracted wherever the corals were sufficiently dense. Large populations of many small reef fish that live only around living corals quickly found the coral transplants and established themselves. The presence of many juveniles and rapidly increasing populations of these species indicate that they have become self-sustaining populations. Dense schools of young fishes of many species were observed to be attracted to the mineral accretion corals, apparently choosing them as sites to metamorphose from larval stages into juveniles. Snappers quickly found the structures an attractive place to hide in the day time, forming schools so dense that it was often impossible to see the other sides of the structures. Batfish also became regular inhabitants. Damsel fish and cleaning fishes quickly established territories on the structures. Other species of reef fish come to graze on the thin coating of algae growing on the less charged structures, and many other species simply pass through them in their search for food. Most fish species appear to be attracted by the electrical currents, and none to be repelled. In addition many invertebrates, including attached tunicates and mobile squid, cuttlefish, sea urchins, and starfish, have established themselves at the sites. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Only very low levels of coral mortality were observed. Some was due to corals that were dislodged from the structures by waves, divers, or fish before they were fully attached. Some corals were so severely damaged before transplantation that they died of their injuries. Other corals were infested with the coral-eating snail Drupella, which can quickly kill colonies if they are not removed. These were found in swarms of plague proportions on the reef, and are currently the major cause of coral mortality. Some coral species appeared to have minimum sizes for successful transplantation. While most pieces as small as a few millimeters across were successfully transplanted, some of the larger polyped corals appear to need larger areas of tissue to be successfully transplanted. Certain species of thin leafy corals or delicate branching corals proved to be hard to transplant because they tended to break while being attached. Some corals that were collected in deeper areas or on walls bleached when transplanted into shallow water, but most recovered in a few weeks. Only a tiny handful of corals were observed to die for no obvious reason, and it is possible that these were diseased. There was no species of which at least some fragments did not successfully attach and grow. 

Due to the need to replace faulty cables, coral transplantation was greatly slowed down, and most structures have far too little coral on them. Because of faulty cables, many of the structures were receiving insufficient power until this problem was corrected. The corals on these structures were notably less vigorously growing and less brightly coloured than those structures receiving full power, and the mineral accretion on these structures tended to build up a dark surface layer of algal growth that was not apparent on those fully charged, which were white in appearance.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Sustainable eco-tourism requires the protection of natural beauty, yet conservation often conflicts with traditional users of the same habitats. For example, fish become more valuable when they can be seen again and again by divers and snorkelers, ""paying"" for themselves many times over, whereas their value for a fisherman is only equivalent to a single meal.  In an attempt to reconcile these competing interests, hotels, dive shops, village fisher folk, scientists, and conservationists have united in Pemuteran to protect and restore coral reefs and thus to increase ecosystem resources for both tourism and fisheries. By restoring and protecting their reefs and aiding in the recovery of fish populations, the residents of Pemuteran stand to gain much from a vibrant ecotourism industry and healthy, sustainable fisheries.
Even in the earliest stages, these projects show dramatic results in increasing coral growth and fish populations. The projects are also a major attraction for divers and snorkellers. They show great promise for restoring damaged coral reefs and need to be applied on a large scale wherever coral reef deterioration has been seen, especially across Indonesia, as it is the centre of tropical marine biodiversity. Biorockâ„¢ nurseries have the potential to play a significant role in maintaining coral reef ecosystems in the face of accelerating threats from global warming. With regard to the management of the actual Pemuteran structures, the corals and their growth need to be periodically monitored by video, at least twice a year, and if possible four times a year, to get a handle on seasonal changes. The stimulation of coral growth is likely to vary strongly between different coral species and between structures receiving different amounts of current. Therefore it will be especially important to monitor the growth of all the corals on all the structures in order to determine which species do best under different rates of charging. Growth rates should be monitored from time to time using video images. Many of the coral fragments transplanted came from known nearby colonies, and both the transplants and the mother colonies need to have their growth monitored to allow determination of the amount of growth enhancement from mineral accretion. In addition it will be important to try to transplant and cultivate the fullest range of local species, including those that are still under-represented or absent from the structures.
The best results will come with periodic maintenance. Power supplies need to be checked, cables need to be kept buried in the ground where they cannot be damaged, and cables in the wave breaking zone need to be kept sheathed in PVC pipe to prevent rubbing on rocks and breaking during storms. Corals that are broken or dislodged should be promptly repositioned, and coral eating pests, such as crown of thorns starfish or Drupella snails need to be removed. Structures should be periodically inspected to ensure that they are growing well and that they are receiving the electricity they need to function properly.
To prevent future destruction of the reef by harmful fishing practices, a community educational program was initiated in order to encourage local users to assume responsibility for their own reefs and marine resources. As part of this effort, a program of coastal security has been established with daily patrols to control bombers and poison fishing. This is the first program of its type in Indonesia, and the Pemuteran fishermen, with help from the local police, have already stopped several groups of bombers and poison fishermen on the outer reefs.
Although climate change could still pose a threat to these reefs, the Biorockâ„¢ nurseries have been shown to allow corals to thrive, even when water quality conditions have deteriorated to the point of killing surrounding corals. Coral growing on the mineral accretion structure often has a higher growth rate and healthier metabolism, resulting in faster and more prolific reproduction. Hence, these nursery populations tend toward greater resilience to unfavorable environmental conditions and also play a key role in restocking the surrounding reefs. "

The grounding destroyed 5,805 square meters of living corals and injured 644 square meters of coral reef framework. The Molasses Coral Reef Restoration Project, implemented by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), involved the restoration of fourteen separate reef sites damaged during the 1984 incident. The restoration included the placement of twenty-two dome shaped reef modules made of concrete and limestone that were designed to replicate the spur and groove formation of the grounding site and to provide substrate for new coral colonization. These reef modules were anchored to the natural reef using a special concrete mixture, tremie, and great care was taken to ensure that repaired areas demonstrated similar reef crest elevations and structural characteristics as those of the adjacent reef.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry On August 4, 1984, the M/V Wellwood, a 122-meter Cypriot-registered freighter traveling in 6 meters of water, ran aground on Molasses Reef about 6 nautical miles southeast of Key Largo in Monroe County, Florida. The Wellwood remained grounded for 12 days, injuring the coral more as time went on. Damage occurred as a result of initial attempts to power off the reef, from tugboat prop wash abrasion, from extended periods of shading under the vessel, and from cable abrasion during several failed attempts to remove the vessel from the reef. The injury toppled or injured thirteen large coral heads and left bottom paint embedded in exposed coral skeletons. The grounding destroyed a total of 5,805 square meters of living corals and injured over 75,000 square meters of reef habitat, including 644 square meters of coral reef framework.
Additional injury to the reef occurred as a result of Hurricanes Elena and Kate in 1985 and the active 1998 storm season (Groundhog Day Storm, Hurricane Georges). The 1998 storm season also removed many of the juvenile coral recruits and the colonies that had been transplanted in 1985 from nearby Pickles Reef. Molasses Reef is a bank reef. Bank reefs are elongated structures located near the abrupt change in bottom slope that marks the seaward edge of the Floridian Plateau. They occur mostly at a depth of 5 to 10 meters (Jaap, 1984). Distinctive characteristics of these reefs include vertical zonation of coral communities by depth, the presence of seaward spur and groove formations, and in many cases the presence of Acropora palmata (Jaap, 1984; Wheaton and Jaap, 1988). The large size often attained by multibranched A. palmata colonies attracts large schools of snappers, grunts, and other species of fish that seek structure for shelter. A. palmata uses fragmentation recruitment to exploit spatial resources, and broken branches would grow rapidly to form new colonies (Wheaton and Jaap, 1988). Communities at Molasses Reef from inshore to offshore are seagrass flats, reef flat (mostly rubble), spur and groove, buttress zone, mixed hardgrounds and sediments, and slope platform (Chiappone, 1996b). The seagrass flats, which rarely exceed 3 to 4 meters in depth, are covered by the seagrasses Thalasia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme and sand-filled blowouts. Overhanging ledges are formed in some of the deeper holes by the rhizomes and roots of the seagrasses. The queen conch, Strombus gigas, inhabits this area, as do isolated brain and star coral colonies of Diploria clivosa and Montastraea complex, respectively; A. palmata; the sea fan Gorgonia ventalina; and the sea whip Pterogorgia anceps.
Octocorals and stony corals become more prevalent in the transition from a relatively flat, high-energy, shallow reef to an elevated three-dimensional system where the increased depth and spatial diversity increase the availability of niches. In this transitional zone, A. palmate occurs on top, and Agaricia agaricites (lettuce coral) is prolific on the vertical faces of the spurs (Wheaton and Jaap, 1988). Octocorals become more abundant, with the number of species doubling compared to the preceding shallower zone. Sheets of Palythoa caribbea are replaced by small, isolated mats, and M. complanata remains moderately abundant.
The Wellwood grounded in the offshore transition zone between the spur and groove reef and the deeper, low-relief hardground. The habitat consisted of numerous large heads of boulder corals and had a diverse community of hard and soft corals and other benthic organisms. The principal coral species present at the site included Montastrea complex, A. palmata, D. cylindrus, A. agaricites, Diploria spp., C. natans, P. astreoides, Favia fragrum, Meandrina meandrites, and Dichocoenia stoksii. Cover also included a healthy gorgonian community, including many sea fans (G. ventalina) and sea rods, the zoanthid P. caribbea, and fire coral, Millepora spp.
Although not permanent residents of Molasses Reef, several endangered species of turtles and marine mammals are known to occur in or travel through the area during seasonal migrations. Federally endangered species of sea turtles that might be visitors to the reef include the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), green turtle (Chelonia mydas), Kemp’s ridley turtle (Lepidochelys kempii), and hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata). In addition, the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), listed federally as threatened, can also be a seasonal visitor. Endangered or threatened marine mammals that might occur in the area include the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), a species indigenous to the FKNMS, as well as the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), right whale (Balaena glacialis), blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), finback whale (Balaenoptera physalus), Sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis), and sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). To stabilize and ultimately restore the reef to the greatest extent practicable, to a state similar to what existed before the injury occurred. Because Molasses Reef is a Sanctuary Preservation Area and a high profile tourist destination, another goal of project practitioners was to design an aesthetically pleasing restoration solution.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: This project involved the installation of 22 dome-shaped reef modules at 14 separate reef sites damaged in the 1984 grounding. The reef modules consist of a reinforced concrete slab, topped with a hollow dome of concrete and limestone, and each module weighs approximately 3500 pounds. The modules were anchored to natural reef by a process of pumping tremie concrete (a specialized concrete mixture designed to maintain consistency and harden in marine applications) beneath and around the base of the module, thereby embedding it into the natural reef structure. In some places, the damaged site was too shallow or had too small a surface area for securing a module, and the reef had to be excavated in order to provide a suitable area for module placement. In these instances, all excavated materials were removed from the project site and disposed of in a landfill or as otherwise directed. There were other cases in which damaged sites had to be built up or filled in to elevate the bottom sufficiently for module installation. At these sites, the tremie mixture was used to bind limestone material into a matrix and fill sunken areas before the modules could be installed. 

A careful assessment of the adjacent undamaged reef was conducted at all fourteen project sites prior to module installation. Practitioners sought to integrate modules as seamlessly as possible into the natural reef and to ensure that restoration techniques resulted in a repaired reef with similar ambient structure and aesthetic qualities as those of the reef prior to the ship's grounding. At the direction of NOAA personnel, each site was ""dressed"" to mimic natural relief by pressing limestone rock into the finished concrete surface or securing rock with mortar around the modules. This use of filler material helped to minimize concrete surface exposure and thereby create a more natural repair surface. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The reef restoration modules have withstood not only winter storms, but the effects of four hurricanes passing by the Florida Keys in 2005 alone. The most encouraging news is that juvenile hard and soft corals are settling on the reef restoration modules, both on natural limestone and concrete surfaces. Surveys of fish, as well as lobster and other invertebrates, demonstrate that the design of the reef restoration modules provides ample habitat for an array of species to survive and thrive.

The Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) conducted 267 roving fish surveys and 246 belt transect surveys during the first year of a five year monitoring project. Surveys were conducted at the Wellwood Restoration Site and two nearby Reference Sites. Total species richness at each site during Year1 surveys was 145 at the Restoration Site, 165 at the North Reference and 176 at the South Reference. Average species richness per monitoring event was 83 at the Restoration Site, 119 at the North Reference and 125 at the South Reference. The top 25 species from each of the reference sites were also recorded at the Restoration Site; however there were several species of grunt and snapper that were in high abundance at the reference sites that were rare at the Restoration site. The Restoration Site transects were dominated by herbivorous parrotfish and surgeonfish; these families were present in similar abundances at the reference sites. The average size of surgeonfish and parrotfish increased over time at the Restoration Site. The proportion of surgeonfish at the Restoration Site greater than 20cm, increased to 17% after one year, up from 4% in the months immediately following restoration. Similarly, while large parrotfish were rare during the first 5 monitoring events, 23% of the individuals recorded at the Restoration Site during the July 2003 (one year) effort were greater than 30cm.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Molasses Reef and Ecological Sanctuary Preservation Area contain some of the most aesthetically valuable and heavily visited reefs in the continental United States. It is part of the Florida Reef Tract, the third largest barrier reef system in the world. As such, its restoration and preservation are of great interest and import.
Immediately after the grounding event, NOAA funded several monitoring efforts at the most heavily injured grounding sites in order to document the recovery and status of the impact area. This has included monitoring coral community recovery, fish population recovery, and algal community recovery. In addition, NOAA has developed a post-restoration monitoring plan and thus, monitoring will continue after the project completion. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/mauritius-mangrove-restoration/	Mauritius: Mangrove Restoration	Mauritius	1995-06-15	2005-06-15	"In 1995, the Mauritius Ministry of Fisheries started a Mangrove Propagation Programme with the aim of protecting and reforesting denuded areas, and also educating the public about the importance of this ecosystem. The programme consisted of several distinct planting phases, some of which utilized nursery-reared seedlings, while others involved the direct planting of propagules. A project of considerable duration, the planting effort ultimately resulted in 13 hectares of restored mangroves (a significant percentage of Mauritius’s total mangrove area), and survival rates have been favorable to date.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry With agriculture, industry, and tourism (mainly marine-based) as its principal economic bases, Mauritius has enjoyed two decades of rapid development. However, the natural resource base of the coastal zone has been increasingly degraded by terrestrial inputs (dyestuff, heavy metals and complex chemical compounds, sewage) from intensified urbanization. Moreover, some of the mangrove areas have been privately utilized for farming mullet, crab, shrimp, and seacarp, while others have been degraded as a result of tourist infrastructure, ports and public beaches. Cyclones have also caused extensive damage to fragile coastal ecosystems in Mauritius. The mangroves of Mauritius are mainly restricted to the northeast and east coasts and are comprised of two species: Rhizophora mucronata and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza. R. mucronata is the more common species, however, representing almost 100% of the mangrove area. Mangrove belts often occur along lagoons and are part of complex systems encompassing a variety of habitats: beaches, sand or mud swamps, mangrove belts, lagoon channels, coral colonies, sand cays, a reef zone, and seagrass beds (including patches of Halophila ovata, Halodule uninervis, and Syrinqodium isoetifolium). The main objectives of the Mangrove Propagation Programme were to restore denuded areas with mangroves and to propagate them at places where natural regeneration was slow.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: This project employed both indirect and direct methodology. For the indirect planting phases, a mangrove nursery was established at Mahebourg Fish Farm. Mangrove propagules were collected, placed in small plastic bags with mud and kept in the nursery until they reached the four-leaf stage (2-3 months). The nursery-reared seedlings were then planted at selected sites around the island.

The project also incorporated a direct planting phase, wherein mature propagules where collected from parent trees and then directly planted in the mud at the selected site. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: During the first phase (June 1995 - 1996), 12,400 seedlings were planted at nine sites around the island
covering a total lagoonal area of 22,750m2, much of this in and adjacent to Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), including Black River, Poudre d'Or and Grand Port Fishing Reserves. An average survival rate of 65% was noted. The second phase (June 1997 - December 1998), involved four sites along the west coast, covering an area of 23,750 m2 where 47,500 seedlings were planted. During the third phase (February 2000 - 2001), five sites along the north shore were selected and 40,000 seedlings were planted covering 20,000 m2. For the fourth phase, three sites in the east with an area of 29,000 m2 were planted with 58,000 seedlings. The fifth phase, involved a mud flat of 25,000 m2 on the western part of the island. No seedlings were planted at this site, but 42,000 propagules were collected from mother trees and directly inserted in the mud to about one-third their length, without prior development in the nursery. A year later, over 95% of the propagules had developed into healthy plants reaching four to six leaf stages, confirming the success of directly planting propagules. Planting efforts continued from April to May 2004, with 14,000 seedlings planted over 7,000 m2 with a 70% survival rate. Finally, 900 seedlings were planted over 1,000 m2 in 2005.


Since 1995, a total of 214,800 mangrove seedlings / propagules have been planted over an area of 129,500 m2, or approximately 13 hectares, with an estimated overall survival rate of 78%. With the 9.4 hectares of existent mangrove swamps, the 13 hectares of restored mangroves increase the total mangrove area in Mauritius to approximately 23 hectares. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: It was noted that around 7,000 plants were destroyed in October 2004.  After investigating the loss, it was found that they had been destroyed for access of boats to the shore.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Healthy coastal ecosystems are central to Mauritius's overall economic vitality. Around 70% of commercial fish species depend on mangroves, particularly in their juvenile stages. Not only are fisheries reliant upon healthy mangroves, so too is the growing tourist industry in Mauritius. Tourism has become an increasingly important source of revenue for the country as a whole, and much of this tourism centers around coastal attractions. Therefore, the restoration and protection of mangroves, and thus of the larger coastal ecosystem, will help ensure a vital source of income and livelihood.
Awareness campaigns are conducted to educate the public and the fishermen community about the importance of mangroves. The following are also included:
1. Distribution of pamphlets to school children and the fishermen community;
2. Delivering of talks at Community Centres and at the Albion Fisheries Research Centre (during guided visits);
3. Communication through mass media and press. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-virginia-oyster-reef-restoration-in-chesapeake-bay/	USA: Virginia: Oyster Reef Restoration in Chesapeake Bay	United States of America	1995-05-13	1995-05-13	"Efforts to restore the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reef habitats in Chesapeake Bay typically begin with the placement of hard substrata to form three-dimensional mounds on the seabed to serve as a base for oyster recruitment and growth. A shortage of oyster shell for creating large-scale reefs has led to widespread use of other materials, such as Surf clamshell (Spisula solidissima), as a substitute for oyster shell. Oyster recruitment, survival and growth were monitored on intertidal reefs constructed from oyster and Surf clamshell near Fisherman’s Island, Virginia, U.S.A. and on a subtidal Surf clamshell reef in York River, Virginia, U.S.A. At the intertidal reefs, oyster larvae settlement occurred at similar levels on both substrate types throughout the monitoring period but higher levels of post-settlement mortality occurred on clamshell reefs. The oyster shell reef supported greater oyster growth and survival and offered the highest degree of structural complexity. On the subtidal clamshell reef, the quality of the substrate varied with reef elevation. Large shell fragments and intact valves were scattered around the reef base, whereas small, tightly packed shell fragments paved the crest and flank of the reef mound. Oysters were more abundant and larger at the base of this reef and less abundant and smaller on the reef crest. The availability of interstitial space and appropriate settlement surfaces is thought to account for the observed differences in oyster abundance across the reef systems.Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry In Chesapeake Bay, years of poor resource management of both live oysters and shell, mortality from diseases caused by the protistan parasites, Dermo (Perkinsus marinus) and MSX (Haplosporidium nelsoni), and increased sedimentation and environmental degradation have contributed to a dramatic decline in oyster populations and reduced reefs to mere footprints (Hargis & Haven 1988; Hargis 1999). To examine and contrast the oyster recruitment, growth and survival at different reef elevations on a subtidal S. solidissima shell reef at Goodwin Island in lower York River, and intertidal reefs constructed of C. virginica shell and S. solidissima shell near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay at Fisherman’s Island.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: ---Project Sites---
The study area included two created oyster reef sites protected from any commercial harvesting in lower Chesapeake Bay. One site was situated at the mouth of the York River approximately 1 km north of Goodwin Island. An oyster reef base was constructed in spring 1995 of 30,000 bushels (1,057 m3) fractured Surf clam (S. solidissima) shell on a subtidal sandflat (Meisner 1995). The reef measured approximately 1,350 m2 and extended approximately 1.5 m above the seabed. At low tide, the water over the subtidal reef crest was 1.5 m deep.

The other site was located at the Fisherman's Island National Wildlife Refuge near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay at Virginia's eastern shore. During summer 1996, 11 subtidal and intertidal oyster reef habitats were constructed of three substrate materials: Crassostrea virginica shell (market size valves, â‰¥ 7.6 cm shell height), crushed S. solidissima shell, and, although not evaluated in this study, pelletized coal ash. The reefs ranged in size from 162 to 364 m2 (O'Beirn et al. 2000). 

---Sampling---
Sampling of the reef to determine oyster abundance and size at Goodwin Island took place from fall 1999 through summer 2001. Using reference stakes permanently positioned at the reef margins, the surface of the reef was divided into a grid and coordinates were assigned to each cell of the grid. The reef was further subdivided into three depth strata: crest (1.5 m above the seabed), flank (0.8 m above the seabed), and base (0.2 m above the seabed). Within each depth stratum, the coordinates on the reef surface were selected randomly without replacement for each sample. Within the cell, divers placed a square plastic frame (0.25 x 0.25 m) on the reef surface and all substrate material within the frame was removed by hand to a depth of 10 cm (below this depth, shell and associated sediments were black and indicative of anoxic conditions) and placed in a cloth bag. Six replicate quadrat samples per sampling period were collected from each elevation stratum. All live adult (oysters > 30 mm shell height, measured from the hinge to the ventral shell margin), juvenile (â‰¤30 mm shell height), and recently dead (with empty, paired, articulated valves with no evidence of interior fouling) oysters were counted and measured.

Similar methods were used at Fisherman's Island for assessing oyster stocks on the created intertidal reefs (described in detail in O'Beirn et al. 2000). Briefly, in May 1997, 1998, and 1999, three 0.25 x 0.25-m quadrats were collected from each of the three tidal elevations on two replicate reefs of each substrate type. The elevations were subtidal (0.25 m below mean low water), low intertidal (at mean low water), and high intertidal (0.25 m above mean low water). The crests and flanks of different reefs were exposed to different tidal inundation regimes because of settling and erosion of the reefs over time (in particular, one of the oyster shell reefs). Because the tidal elevation of the reef crests ranged from high to low intertidal, the higher tidal elevations from all reefs were not sampled during the entire study. Therefore, to compare oyster density by reef substrate type, analysis was restricted to the samples collected from the subtidal (reef base) and low intertidal (reef crest or flank, depending on the reef) reef elevations. All live and recently dead (with paired, articulated valves with no interior fouling) oysters were enumerated and measured to the nearest 0.1 mm.

Visual comparisons of the size of Surf clamshell (S. solidissima) fragments that made up the Goodwin Islands reef at different elevations were striking and led to a characterization of the reef substrate in July 2000. A subsample of at least 50 shell fragments was randomly selected from each 0.25 m2 reef quadrat sample and the largest dimension of each fragment was measured to the nearest millimeter to characterize the size of the substrate material at each reef elevation. This analysis was not repeated on the Fisherman's Island reefs.

Dead oysters collected from Goodwin Islands were examined for evidence of predation by crabs in 2000 and 2001. Predation by crabs on oysters was distinguished from other sources of mortality by the presence of chipped or cracked valve margins, puncture holes within the umbo region, crushing of the umbo region, and complete crushing of the valves. This analysis was not repeated on the Fisherman's Island reefs. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: ---Goodwin Island---
Oyster densities on the Goodwin Island reef showed a clear pattern relative to reef elevation at all sampling times with the base of the reef having greater oyster densities than reef crest. Elevation on the reef, but not date, influenced densities of both live and dead mature oysters (>30 mm). These oysters were significantly more abundant at the reef base compared with the flank and crest. The size of clamshell fragments making up the reef substrate reflected the distribution of larger oysters and varied among elevation strata. Statistical analysis revealed that fragments of clamshell were significantly larger at reef base compared with flank and crest. Shell fragments from the flank and crest did not differ significantly. 

Densities of live juvenile oysters (â‰¤30 mm) were significantly affected by reef elevation, date and their interaction. Statistical tests revealed the following: (1) during the 1999 and 2000 sampling events, densities of small live oysters were greater at the flank and base than densities at the crest; (2) during the 2001 sampling period, no statistically significant difference in juvenile oyster density according to reef elevation was detected, although as in 1999 and 2000, densities tended to be lowest at the crest; and (3) recruitment of juvenile oysters was lowest in 2000 across all elevations. Densities were greatest in 1999 and intermediate in 2001 at both the reef flank and the base, but no significant differences were detected in densities in these years at the reef crest. Densities of dead juvenile oysters (â‰¤30 mm) were significantly affected by reef elevation and date. These oysters were significantly more abundant at the reef base than at the flank and crest. 

Size frequency distributions reveal that for each of the 3 years, juvenile oysters numerically dominated all samples. Reef crest oysters had a unimodal population distribution each year. Flank and base reef strata exhibited bimodal size distributions in 2001. Juvenile oysters dominated all three strata throughout the sampling period, with mature oysters (>30 mm) rare. A greater proportion of mature oysters were collected from the reef base than from the reef flank, although the difference was small. Dead oysters (with articulated shells) were present at each elevation each year and, although fewer in number, tended to reflect the distribution of live oysters at each elevation.

Dead oysters exhibiting evidence of predation by crabs were collected from each reef elevation but were proportionally more abundant at reef crest and flank compared with the reef base.

---Fisherman's Island---
The mean density of oysters at Fisherman's Island varied significantly according to tidal reef elevation, substrate type, and date. Subtidal oyster densities on the clamshell sustrate reef were greater than those densities at low intertidal reef elevations in 1997. During all other sampling events on both reef types, oyster densities exhibited the reverse pattern with greater oyster densities at the low intertidal reef elevation compared with those located subtidally. Densities of oysters increased over time at the subtidal elevation of the oyster shell reefs and at the low intertidal reef elevation of the clamshell reefs. This pattern was not evident at the low intertidal reef elevation on the oyster shell reef where the density of oysters was lowest in 1998. Oyster densities remained low throughout the study at the clamshell reefs' subtidal elevation. 

Oysters were consistently more abundant on the oyster shell than on the clamshell reef habitat. Overall abundance patterns on clamshell were similar to that found on the clamshell reef at Goodwin Island with a population dominated by small oysters and few oysters surviving to larger sizes (>30 mm). By May 1997, nearly 1 year after reef construction, oysters were notably more abundant on the oyster shell reef compared with the clamshell reef. By May 1998 and through 1999, the size distribution of oysters on the oyster shell reef was bimodal with relatively large numbers of large live oysters, whereas a weaker bimodal size distribution of small live oysters, likely masked by low recruitment, was found on clamshell. Recently, dead oysters with articulated shells were present on both reef types all years and tended to reflect the distribution of live oysters. There appeared to be increased survival on the oyster shell habitats because the ratio of live oyster to recently dead oyster abundance was greater on the oyster shell reefs than on the clamshell reefs each year. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Low recruitment on areas comprising small substrate components (the clamshell reefs at Fisherman's Island and the crest and flank of the Goodwin Islands reef) compared with reef areas of larger reef material fragments (Fisherman's Island's oyster shell reefs and the base of the Goodwin Island reef) may be attributed to differential substrate selection by oysters at the larval stage and post-settlement loss. The former, as evidenced by reduced initial settlement, could be a result of physical processes such as turbulence and flow. If settlement and metamorphosis success were unequal across substrate types, surviving oysters could be expected to be more abundant on reefs with favorable larval habitats, such as demonstrated by the patterns observed on the oyster shell of Fisherman's Island or larger clamshell fragments at Goodwin Island. Conversely, if oyster larval settlement and metamorphosis success were equal across all reefs, the patterns observed could be a result of differing post-settlement mortality pressure on different reef types. If this post-settlement mortality was the result of predation, then different reef substrates may foster predator communities imposing different pressures on newly settled oysters. The matrix of oyster shell reef substrate, having larger interstitial spaces compared with clamshell (O'Beirn et al. 2000), could be more accessible to fish and decapod predators. Although these larger predators may not prey directly upon the small, new recruits, they may feed upon smaller, intermediate predators of oysters, making the reef matrix a predation refuge for young oysters (McDermott & Flower 1952; Grabowski 2004). Smaller interstitial spaces, such as those of the clamshell substrate, may be limiting to larger predators but accessible to small decapods (such as juvenile panopeid and portunid crabs) and flatworms. This reef type may serve as a structural refuge for these individuals, permitting grazing on newly settled oysters. No direct predation comparisons were made between clamshell and oyster shell reefs at Fisherman's Island during this study, hence, further examinations of interactions of newly settled oysters and their predators on different substrate materials are needed to elucidate the potential importance of habitat selection and predation processes in structuring these communities.

In this study, the distribution of oysters with evidence of crab predation reflected the size distribution of clamshell fragments on the reef mound of the Goodwin Island reef. Proportionately fewer dead oysters (regardless of size) displaying typical evidence of crab predation (Eggleston 1990) were collected from the base of the reef where the substrate afforded adequate refuge for young oysters from predators.

Physical disturbance, through the mechanical grinding of the substrate material by waves and currents, may partially explain distribution of live oysters and the physical structure of the subtidal reef at Goodwin Island. The structure of this reef is analogous to natural mature subtidal oyster reefs of the Gulf Coast exhibiting the ""grit principle"" (MacKenzie 1977; Gunter 1979). Reefs of this type form barren central ridges consisting of fine dead shell grit on the reef crest and live oysters are only found along the flanks and in deeper water. Constant motion of the crest substrate from effects of wind-generated waves and currents abrades sessile organisms and hinders oyster larvae development (Gunter 1979). Because few live oysters were collected at the reef crest, which was made up of small, unconsolidated broken shell fragments, such physical disturbance may partially explain the distribution of oysters observed on this reef.
Constructed reef design should account for local geophysical and biological conditions and provide shelter for oysters and associated fauna from such stressors as hypoxia, siltation, ice scour, and resident and transient predators. Materials used as reef substrate should provide adequate small-scale structural complexity with ample refugia for newly settled oysters to avoid predation, whether subtidally or intertidally. In fact, considerations of small-scale structural design, such as the availability of proper settlement substrate (i.e. adequate surface heterogeneity), may be more important to the success of reef restoration efforts in some settings than large-scale aspects of reef design, such as mounding vertical relief.
Given the limited supply of oyster shell for restoration, the results of this study should be used to reassess the types of material and reef construction configurations in future oyster reef restoration efforts. Rather than building an entire mound of one substrate material, a mixture of substrates may lead to improved restoration success. Less desirable substrate materials, such as small Surf clamshell fragments (this study) or gravel (Soniat et al. 1991), could be placed as a base within the core of the mound, and then covered by a veneer of a material comprising larger elements (such as oyster shell, if available, or whole clamshell valves), which offers greater habitat complexity. Because the settlement of oyster larvae is often restricted to the outer layer of substrate material on a reef base (Bartol & Mann 1999), a practical construction approach would be to limit preferred substrate materials to the areas available for settlement. This layer could then provide the small-scale surface structural complexity to the peripheral strata of the mound, providing ample convolutions or tortuosity and surface area to afford settlement surface and refuge for young oysters from predation and physical stress. Thus, the choice of an appropriate construction configuration and substrate type for use as a reef base can dictate success or failure of the developing reef assemblage. "

After initial attempts to manually gather reproductive shoots from donor beds, project practitioners decided to employ a mechanical harvesting boat in order to improve efficiency and viable seed yields. Shoots were gathered and stored at an aquaculture facility, and seeding was subsequently conducted using a variety of techniques. Seed bags were utilized at the sites to mimic natural reproductive processes, and manual and automatic seed dispersal techniques were later employed as well. Despite a large quantity of distributed seeds and initial indicators of success, long-term survival rates for newly established seedlings proved disappointing. Poor water quality and ineffective seed storage procedures are thought to be the primary factors in the low success rate.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry In Chesapeake Bay, deforestation, population growth, and the subsequent sedimentation and nutrient enrichment caused declines in all species of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beginning in the 17th century (Brush and Davis, 1984). However, those changes were relatively minor compared to the catastrophic declines that occurred in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s (Orth and Moore, 1983). Researchers suggest a combination of factors resulted in these losses. Kemp et al. (1983) and Twilley et al. (1985) postulated that increased nutrient loadings of the Chesapeake Bay in the 1970’s enhanced growth of planktonic and periphytic algal species which compete with SAV for light. SAV productivity was shown to be reduced further when suspended sediment increases in the water column, exacerbating light attenuation problems (Wetzel and Penhale, 1983; Kemp et al., 1983). These studies demonstrated that SAV growth and abundance were inextricably linked to water quality. In addition to the combined effects of degraded water quality, the flooding that accompanied Hurricane Agnes in 1972 resulted in a prolonged period of high suspended sediment loads at a critical time of year for SAV growth. The combination of stressors had devastating effects on the SAV acreage baywide, and few areas have recovered to their 1930’s- 1950’s levels. The Potomac River is the largest river in Maryland, with a drainage area of 14,679 square miles in four states. The majority of the Potomac basin’s land area is covered by forests (57.6%), followed by agriculture (31.8%), water and wetlands (5%) and developed land (4.8%, Potomac River Basin Summary, DNR website). As a large tidal river, the Potomac has significant freshwater (0 ppt salinity), oligohaline (0.5-5 ppt), and mesohaline (5-18 ppt) reaches, each with their own unique water quality attributes. To identify and strategically plant or reseed SAV beds in regions of the Chesapeake Bay where habitat conditions are suitable for SAV growth. The establishment of dense, protected beds will afford both a source of seeds to accelerate natural revegetation and the self-protection necessary to ensure the longevity of newly established beds.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The primary stakeholders in this project are the many partners comprising the Chesapeake Bay Program and the signatories to the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. These include, among others: the Chesapeake Bay Commission, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Commonwealth of Virginia, District of Columbia, State of Maryland, State of Delaware, State of West Virginia, New York State, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Federal partners also include the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Enforcement Coalition, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Department of Education. A number of academic institutions are associated with the restoration effort, including: the Academy of Natural Sciences, Chesapeake Research Consortium (CRC), College of William and Mary, Cornell Cooperative Extension, Smithsonian Institute, University of Maryland, University of Pennsylvania, University of Virginia, and the Virginia Cooperative Extension Office. Other stakeholder institutions include: the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay (ACB), American Forests, Anacostia Watershed Society, Center for Chesapeake Communities (CCC), Center for Watershed Protection (CWP), Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF), Chesapeake Bay Trust, Ducks Unlimited, Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Potomac Conservancy, Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC), and Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB).

Description of Project Activities: *Site Selection*
Locations for large-scale restoration activity were determined using a Geographic Information System (GIS) based SAV restoration targeting model (Parham and Karrh 1998). The model uses six layers of key habitat information to evaluate the suitability, ability and potential of a particular habitat to support SAV populations. Five sites in the lower Potomac River were identified as suitable for eelgrass recolonization based on the DNR SAV targeting model:
 -   Cherryfield Point (N38Â° 07.819' W76Â° 27.574')
 -   Piney Point (N38Â° 08.279' W76Â° 30.159')
 -   Sage Point (N38Â° 07 53.2' W076Â° 26 10.5')
 -   St. George Island (N38Â° 08 07.6' W076Â° 29 41.4')
 -   Kitt's Point (N36Â° 06.628' W76Â° 25.471')

*Test plantings*
To determine the best planting sites within the areas identified by the SAV restoration targeting model, adult plants raised in the laboratory and harvested from existing beds in the bay were transplanted into three, one square meter plots in areas adjacent to seed broadcast and seed bag areas. Sixty-four adult plants were planted in each plot, anchored by wooden skewers (Davis, 1997). These test plantings were monitored for percent survival at 1 week, 4 weeks and 16 weeks after initial planting.

*Seed Collection*
To begin the project, DNR staff concentrated efforts on finding the most productive donor beds from which to harvest. In May 2003, eelgrass reproductive shoots were collected manually from donor beds in Sinepuxent Bay and Tangier Sound. For approximately 3 weeks, DNR staff and volunteers snorkeled and used scuba equipment to manually remove the reproductive shoots of eelgrass. This method yielded a total of 2.3 million seeds, 250,000 of which were viable for broadcast. 

This was a very expensive and inefficient process in terms of man-hours involved, so over the winter, alternative methods of harvesting were investigated. It was found that very little work had to be done to adapt a mechanical harvesting boat, previously used to harvest water chestnut (Trapa natans), to collect eelgrass reproductive shoots. The reproductive shoots stand above a majority of the plant biomass and could be harvested with little or no impact on the eelgrass beds. During subsequent harvests in 2004 and 2005 in the Little Annemessex River and Tangier Sound (N37Â° 58.479' W75Â° 52.255' and N37Â° 59.073' W75Â° 59.206', respectively), a mechanical harvest boat was utilized (M J McCook & Associates, La Plata MD) to increase the volume of reproductive material collected. The harvester would run systematic transects within the beds, adjusting the cutting blades to account for changes in depth. As the boat moved slowly through the water, the cutting blades clipped the eelgrass reproductive shoots at approximately one foot above the sediment. This method yielded 15.12 million seeds in 2004, of which 1,058,400 seeds were viable for broadcast. 

*Seed Processing and Storage*
Once the bags of harvested eelgrass reproductive shoots arrived at Piney Point Aquaculture Facility, they
were placed in one of eight, 20,000 gallon (32'x32'x4') or one of sixteen 9,800 gallon (20'x20'x4') greenhouse basins. The water in each basin was replaced daily with local St. Georges Creek water and augmented with aquaculture grade sea salt to match conditions at the harvesting areas (~14ppt). In addition, each basin was aerated to prevent anoxia. Typical basin dissolved oxygen levels averaged 5-6 mg/l. Water quality was monitored twice daily in order to ensure adequate conditions. While in the basins, the eelgrass seeds slowly dropped from the reproductive shoots over the following month. After all the seeds were released and settled to the bottom of the basins, the seed/reproductive shoot slurry was pumped into a series of stacked settling trays to allow the passive accumulation of seeds while discarding the non-seed material.

*Seeding* 
As the bags of harvested material arrived at Piney Point, about 15,000 L were used to fill seed bags for deployment. DNR used a modified version of the buoy deployed seeding system, (BuDSS), created by Chris Pickerell at Cornell University Extension Service (Pickerell et al., 2003). Four gallons of collected reproductive shoots were placed in a mesh bag, divided into three sections by cable ties, and supported on each end with a small buoy. At one end, 2.1 m of polypropylene rope was attached to a cinderblock to anchor the seed bag. The mesh bags remain suspended above the sediment allowing the seeds to mature and drop over a period of weeks, thus mimicking the floating and rafting of reproductive shoots during natural seeding events (Pickerel et al. 2003). Although not proven, it has been suggested that this method may also reduce predation by spreading out seed dispersal over time and through a combination of time and natural forces yield a more even distribution of seeds.  Two types of seed bags were constructed and deployed: single (50,000 seeds) and double (100,000 seeds). Seed bags were deployed at the restoration sites by watermen and DNR staff for approximately one month. 

Eelgrass seeds were also hand broadcast using methods employed by Orth (Orth, Personal Communication) during the fall of 2003. The restoration site was divided into seven 25 m radius plots 1963.4 m2, or 0.485 acres. The plots were then divided into 5m concentric circles from a central point. The concentric areas at 5m increments were chosen to evenly allocate the seeds across the plot by broadcasting while walking around the plot in concentric circles. To distribute at a density of 100,000 seeds/acre, 50,000 seeds or 660 ml, were broadcast with the appropriate proportions going to each concentric section. For example, 237mL of seeds (36% of the total 660mL) went into the outer ring.

This method was slow and did not guarantee an even distribution of seeds. Subsequent seed broadcasts in the fall 2004 were achieved mechanically using a specially designed seed broadcast apparatus developed by C & K Lord and Associates and DNR staff. All seed broadcasts took place before ambient water temperatures dropped to 15ÂºC, the temperature at which eelgrass seeds begin germination. In Maryland, seeds were mechanically dispersed using a newly developed seed-sprayer from C& K Lord, Inc capable of evenly dispersing seeds at suitable densities (200,000 seeds/acre) at the rate of 10 minutes/acre.

*Assessment*
Germination rates, seedling survival, and growth in each seeding density replicate were assessed annually at approximately 1 month, 6 months and 12 months after seeding following methods similar to that of Orth et al. (2003). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: *St. George Island*
In spring 2004, seed bags containing 605,000 seeds were dispersed in a 5 acre plot. The site was monitored for the first time on May 12, 2005 and there were 567 eelgrass plants observed per acre, with an estimated 2,835 eelgrass plants in the entire plot. In the fall of 2004, 75,000 seeds were dispersed by machine broadcast in a 0.3 acre plot. The fall seeding area had 586 eelgrass plants per acre on May 12,, 2005 for an estimated 147 plants in the plot. Test plantings placed at each site in November 2004 were monitored on the same dates. In May 2005, an average of 55 plants were observed among the three test
plots at St. George Island, yielding an 86% initial planting success rate. In August, 6% of the plants remained, half of which survived through November 2005.

*Sage Point*
In 2004, there was only spring seed bag dispersal at this site. There were two sites, each with 605,000 seeds spread over 5 acre plots. Field observations made by biologists identified large amounts of widgeon grass, snails, and live oysters on the bottom. Test plantings placed at this site in November 2004 were monitored on the same dates. In May 2005, an average of 52 plants was observed among the three test plots at Sage Point, yielding an 81% initial planting success rate. In August and November of 2005, no plants were observed.

*Cherryfield Point*
In 2004, there was a spring seed bag and fall seed broadcast at this site. In the spring, two adjacent 2.5 acre plots were seeded with seed bags with 275,000 seeds dispersed in each plot (550,000 total). Test plantings placed at this site in November 2004 were monitored on the same dates. In May 2005, an average of 11 plants was observed among the three test plots at Cherryfield Point, yielding a 17% initial planting success rate. In August and November, no plants were observed.

*Seed Bags*
The spring seed bag method yielded 7,193 seedlings across all spring seed bag site locations out of 2.4 million seeds broadcast, a recruitment success rate of 0.3%. The fall seed broadcast method yielded 147 seedlings across all fall seed broadcast locations out of 262,000 seeds dispersed, a recruitment success rate of 0.06%. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Eelgrass seed distributions in 2004 resulted in the successful establishment of seedlings at each site in May 2005. However, almost all adult test plot plants and seedlings completely disappeared in the summer of 2005. To determine the cause for the near complete loss of adult plants, water quality data from the continuous monitoring stations, mainstem stations, and the water quality mapping cruises were analyzed to detect trends or spikes in water temperature and turbidity data that may explain these results. A number of studies have shown that decreased light availability affects eelgrass survival (Philips et al. 1978; Kemp et al. 1983; Dennison and Albert 1986; Twilley et al. 1985). Eelgrass requires between 6 and 8 hours of photosynthetic saturating irradiance per day to survive (Dennison and Alberte, 1985). Although it is not well documented how many days healthy plants can survive elevated turbidity and decreased light availability, it is not likely that the recruited seedlings or adult plants could survive the prolonged periods of high turbidity such as those reflected by the continuous monitor data (see figures). When water clarity data for 2003, 2004 and 2005 are compared to the 20-year record, the values are below the mean each year, with 2003 being the year with the worst water clarity. 

Water temperature was another major factor in the low recovery rate observed at the project sites. Eelgrass in the Chesapeake Bay is near the southernmost extent of its distribution on the east coast of the United States. Although it is not well documented how many days healthy plants can tolerate elevated temperatures like those recorded during monitoring activities in 2005, the fact that instances of elevated turbidity coincide with elevated temperatures are the likely reason that most recruited seedlings and adult plants did not survive the summer of 2005.

The last significant factor in the recovery rate of SAV observed during the project period is the long-term storage of spring-harvested seeds. Regardless of other factors that may have played a role in the variance observed, spring seeding clearly was the most effective method for seed distribution in 2004.  Recruitment was much lower for fall seed broadcast due to poor seed survival during storage. Although attempts have been made to improve current storage techniques, and thus increase the number of viable seeds, the care of seeds through the summer has proven to be one of the most difficult aspects of this project.
Despite some advantages to using adult plants (e.g. successful adult plants yield reproductive shoots during the following year’s reproductive season, Orth, 2003), seed broadcasting appears to be a more efficient and cost effective restoration technique with the added benefit of having less impact on donor beds (Orth, 2000).
Evaluation of the cost effectiveness of the different seeding methods used showed that spring seed bags were by far the most cost effective restoration technique, with a cost per seedling of $1.70 (compared to $4.70 for planting an adult plant and $363.89 per seedling for fall seed broadcasting). This project is part of ongoing SAV restoration in Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay Program intends to restore 1,000 acres of SAV by December 2008. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/australia-seagrass-rehabilitation-in-adelaide-metropolitan-coastal-waters/	Australia: Seagrass Rehabilitation in Adelaide Metropolitan Coastal Waters	Australia	2004-09-08	2005-10-08	"A seagrass rehabilitation experiment aimed at determining the best method for facilitating the natural recruitment of Amphibolis seedlings was carried out at two sites along the Adelaide metropolitan coast. Previous seagrass restoration in South Australia has focused on methods developed elsewhere, including the transplantation of mature seagrass units and the culturing and planting out of seagrass seedlings. The use of these methods has proven difficult, and results have generally been poor owing to the exposed nature of the Adelaide metropolitan coast. An alternative approach is to facilitate the natural recruitment of seagrass seedlings in situ. This project was conducted to assess the ability of various artificial substrates to aid in facilitating the natural recruitment of Amphibolis antarctica and A. griffithii seedlings. A range of biodegradable hessian bags, strips and mats in various configurations were deployed at two sites along the Adelaide coast, and the relative effectiveness of each substrate at facilitating recruitment was evaluated. The methods developed in this study offer significant advantages to other methods of restoration, particularly as they are non-destructive, cost effective, and may easily be deployed over large spatial scales.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Over recent decades, the Adelaide metropolitan coast has lost more than 5,200 ha of seagrass habitat due to increasing anthropogenic pollution (e.g. sewage, stormwater discharges, etc.) and coastal development. Holdfast Bay alone has lost more than 4,000 ha of seagrasses since the 1940s (Figure 1; Hart, 1997). This loss of seagrass has contributed to considerable and ongoing erosion of the Adelaide foreshore and marine environment, and has reduced the amount of habitat available for many local species of flora and fauna. Holdfast Bay, the site of the current study, is located adjacent to Adelaide (138Â°35’55″E, 34Â°55’42″S), South Australia. The Bay contains Posidonia angustifolia, P. australis, P. sinuosa, and Amphibolis antarctica beds interspersed with small patches of A. griffithii (Shepherd and Robertson, 1989). Heterozostera tasmanica and Halophila australis also occur throughout, often as an understorey component to larger species, although Heterozostera may occur more densely in deeper areas (Shepherd and Robertson, 1989). The seagrass community once dominated the soft-bottom coastline to within several hundred metres of the shore. To assess the ability of various artificial substrates to aid in facilitating the natural recruitment of Amphibolis Antarctica and A. griffithii seedlings.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The stakeholders in this project include the Department for Environment and Heritage, the residents of the Adelaide coast, and the community of seagrass researchers and restoration practitioners that will ultimately benefit from the findings of this study.

Description of Project Activities: Both study sites were located approximately two kilometres from the shore, in unvegetated areas previously dominated by seagrass, and were surrounded by dense seagrass beds consisting largely of Amphibolis. The first site (138Âº28'03.5""E, 34Âº54'01.9""S) was situated adjacent to Grange in approximately 8 m of water, while the second was located further north (138Âº27'47.9""E, 34Âº52'20.1""S), adjacent to Semaphore Park in approximately 6.5 m depth. Inshore surface water temperature within the area varies seasonally between 11.0 ÂºC and 26.6 ÂºC, while total dissolved solids generally vary between 33.0 and 38.8 Î¼gL-1.

To determine the spatial distribution of habitats surrounding the two sites chosen for this study, eight transects radiating from the centre of each site were established. Habitat types (sand, Amphibolis, Posidonia, Heterozostera and Halophila) were characterised along each transect, and in most cases, at least fifty metres of habitat was recorded beyond the edge of the sand patch in which the study site was located. 

The habitats surrounding the two sites selected for this study differed. Site one was characterised by a larger sand patch than site two (radius of 30.9 Â± 3.39 m), and was surrounded almost entirely by monospecific meadows of Amphibolis antarctica (97.3%). The seagrass community surrounding site two consisted of dense Amphibolis antarctica beds (53.9%) and Posidonia sinuosa and P. angustifolia beds (44.2%).

To quantify the light climate at each site, Odyssey light loggers (Dataflow Systems Pty Ltd, New Zealand) were attached to star pickets approximately 1 m above the sediment surface at the centre of each site in July 2005. The light loggers were programmed to record Photosynthetically Active Radiation every half an hour and were replaced on a fortnightly basis to avoid the build up of sediments and the growth of algae on the sensor element. As expected, the shallower of the two sites (site two) generally received more light during August, September and October. The opposite trend was observed during July, as near-shore, turbid waters associated with storm periods can substantially reduce seabed light availability in these shallower areas (S. Bryars, personal communication).

With site data recorded, a range of biodegradable substrates in various forms was deployed at the two study sites in an attempt to enhance the natural recruitment of Amphibolis seedlings. Three different biodegradable materials were used in creating the recruitment facilitation substrates: a fine-weave hessian, a coarse-weave hessian, and mats constructed from interwoven seagrass (see Figure 5 in attached document). Using these materials, ten different recruitment facilitation techniques were trialed (each of varying size and configuration), including six different hessian bags, three different strips and a seagrass mat.

The hessian bags and weighted strips were deployed on the September 7, 2004. In the week that followed (September 15-16), divers rearranged the bags and strips in a predetermined, randomised manner. Bags were randomly placed on either side of four transects, at least one metre apart, radiating in north, south, east and west directions from the centre of each site; while strips were randomly positioned along transects radiating in north-west, north-east, south-east and south-westerly directions. During the same period, the hessian strips and the seagrass mats were set out by divers along each transect. The three-metre long hessian strips were planted by digging a trench approximately 30 cm deep and pegging the hessian into the substrate at each end and in the middle. The trench was then filled in, burying the bound edges but leaving approximately 30 cm of the hessian exposed. Strips were laid in two different orientations (east-west and north-south) to assess the potential for long-shore currents to enhance recruitment. A three-metre gap separated each strip. The seagrass mats were anchored to the sediment with four steel tent pegs, one in each corner. Bags filled with sand were sufficiently heavy so as not to need staking down. Following deployment, all bags, strips and mats were labeled. At each site between eight and ten replicates of each method were deployed.

To determine the effectiveness of the different recruitment facilitation methods, the number of seedlings on each unit was monitored over time. Monitoring was undertaken shortly after deployment on 12 October 2004 and subsequently in December 2004 and February, April, June and September 2005. In order to compare the effectiveness of the different methods in capturing and maintaining seagrass seedlings, seedling numbers were converted to seedlings per square meter for analysis.

The growth of Amphibolis seedlings over time was assessed by randomly collecting 15 seedlings from the hessian units at each site in December 2004 and February and October 2005 (representing seedlings that were approximately 14, 23 and 57 weeks old). Seedlings that had been recently released from the parent plant were also collected in September 2005, and these were assumed to represent age 0. Divers collected the seedlings in plastic bags, which were then transported to the laboratory where morphological measurements--including seedling height, the number of shoots, the number of short shoots, and the number and length of all roots--were undertaken. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Following the deployment of 196 recruitment facilitation units, over 16,500 Amphibolis seedlings recruited at the two study sites. Seedling recruitment and retention over the 53-week experimental period varied significantly with method and site, and at the end of the experimental period ranged from 6.7 Â± 4.44 to 141.8 Â± 32.84 seedlings per square meter. Approximately 31.4% of initial seedlings survived the 53-week experimental period, and seedling survival varied significantly with method. The most effective method in terms of seedling density at the end of the experimental period was hessian bags covered with a coarse weave hessian layer. This method, together with large hessian bags, was also among the most cost-effective.  The most successful method in terms of initial seedling recruitment was not necessarily the most successful over the longer term. Indeed, seedling recruitment was highest on hessian strips, but this method had the poorest survival rate, with 10.6% and 27.1% on north-south and east-west oriented strips, respectively. At the end of the experimental period, the seagrass mats differed significantly from all other methods. They were the most ineffective method in terms of seedling recruitment and survival, with an average of 15.2 Â± 8.48 seedlings per square meter at site one and 6.7 Â± 4.44 seedlings per square meter at site two. Notwithstanding this, it is worth noting that no attached seedlings were observed on adjacent sandy substrates.

Significant differences in seedling recruitment were observed between the two sites, and are likely to reflect the composition of the surrounding seagrass beds, depth and local hydrodynamic regime. Site one was more effective in recruiting Amphibolis seedlings, with an average 238% greater seedling density than site two (221.6 Â± 18.49 and 92.9 Â± 8.10 seedlings per square meter, respectively). The double-layered hessian bags supported the highest density of seedlings at both sites (site 1, 141.8 Â± 32.84 seedlings per square meter; site 2, 95.6 Â± 14.48 seedlings per square meter), although significant differences between sites were apparent. At site one, although mean seedling density was greatest on the double-layered hessian bags, it did not differ significantly from that on many of the other substrates, including the east-west oriented strips, weighted strips, hessian bags, large hessian bags, half buried hessian bags, hessian bags with mats and bags with a flap. Interestingly, at this site the north-south oriented strips retained far fewer seedlings than did the east-west oriented strips. At site two, however, the double-layered hessian bags retained significantly more seedlings than any other method.

Above-ground biomass of Amphibolis seedlings increased substantially over time, owing to increased seedling height and an increase in the number of shoots and short shoots. Seedling height almost doubled over the 57 week period, increasing from approximately 104.4 mm to 198.5 mm, while the number of short shoots increased from 0 to 4.2. Secondary shoots were initially observed on seedlings approximately 23 weeks old and at 57 weeks, seedlings generally consisted of either 2 or 3 shoots. Below-ground biomass of Amphibolis seedlings increased almost seven fold over the 57 week period as a result of significant root development. Seedlings recently released from the parent plant generally only had 1 root, approximately 2.2 mm long, however, after 57 weeks seedlings had an average of 10.2 roots with a combined length of 639 mm. At this time, maximum root length had reached 213 mm and averaged 123.6 mm. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Differences in the ability of different methods to recruit and retain Amphibolis seedlings are likely to reflect a number of factors including material type (weave of fabric), profile on the seabed and ability to withstand degradation of the substrate. Seedling recruitment was generally highest on the coarse weave hessian fabrics (including the hessian strips and double-layered hessian bags), probably because the grappling hooks at the base of the seedlings become easily entangled in the hair-like nature of the fabrics' fibres. Fewer seedlings recruited onto the finer weave hessian fabrics, with recruitment particularly poor on the seagrass mats and the mats attached to hessian bags. Poor recruitment onto the seagrass mats may be explained by the fact that the interwoven seagrass making up the mats was coarse and inflexible, making it difficult for the seedlings to become entangled. Furthermore, the mats were situated close to the substrate and may have been more rapidly buried by sediments than other methods, reducing the time available for seedlings to attach. The half buried hessian bags are also likely to have been more rapidly buried, and recruited substantially fewer seedlings than their non-buried counterparts. Seedling retention was poorest on the hessian strips, probably owing to the fact that many of these strips weakened at the sediment level and were lost, along with attached seedlings.

Differences in recruitment levels between sites may be explained by a number of factors, including variation in the proximity to surrounding seagrass beds and the reproductive output and density of those beds. Depth, hydrodynamic conditions and sediment dynamics may have also been factors in the differences between sites. Site one was located in about 8 m of water, approximately 1.5 m deeper than site two. Because the Adelaide metropolitan coast is considered to have moderate wave energies (Townsend, 2002), a difference in depth of 1.5 m between sites is likely to have a significant effect on the influence of currents and wave attenuation, both of which are likely to be considerably higher at site two.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Seagrass meadows have long been recognised for their ecological and economic importance, and together with coral reefs and mangroves, are thought to represent one of the world's most productive coastal habitats (Short and Wyllie-Echeverria, 1996). Seagrass beds not only play a critical role in primary production (Borum et al., 2006) and nutrient cycling (Hillman et al., 1989; Romero et al., 2006), but they also provide habitat for a diverse array of marine organisms (Bell & Pollard, 1989; Short & Wyllie-Echeverria, 1996; Connolly et al., 1999; Duarte, 2002), and increase the stability of the seafloor through the growth of extensive rhizome mats (Fonseca & Fisher, 1986). Thus, restoration of these seagrass beds promises many long-term benefits for the residents of the Adelaide coast.
We have shown here that the provision of suitable substrates can facilitate the natural recruitment of Amphibolis antarctica and A. griffithii seedlings, representing a new method of seagrass restoration that may be suitable for deployment over large spatial scales in moderate wave energy environments in temperate Australian waters. Furthermore, it may be valuable to investigate the use of hessian bags in protecting other species of seagrasses in restoration efforts.
Not only does this method hold promise for improving the effectiveness of seagrass restoration efforts, it has also been found to be highly cost-effective. Extrapolating from the costs of the small-scale trial conducted here, it will cost on the order of $10,000 to rehabilitate one hectare of seagrass. This figure compares favourably with that for other methods, and also relative to the estimated economic value of seagrasses ($12,635 to $25,270 per ha per yr).
In spite of the inherent potential in this methodology, the recovery of seagrass beds through the recruitment of seedlings is highly dependent upon survival and growth of the seedlings over time. While recovery as a result of seedling recruitment has been observed (Preen et al., 1995; Kendrick et al., 1999; Whitfield et al., 2004; Olesen et al., 2004), in many cases, seedling survival is poor. Therefore, additional research is needed to explore ways of optimizing the recruitment process and ensuring the long-term survival of seedlings. It is essential to continue monitoring the growth and survival of recruited seedlings to ensure that seedlings survive over a longer period and that the roots of the seedlings grow through the bags. It is also important to ensure that the shoots develop beyond the edge of the bag and begin to recolonise the bare substrates surrounding them. In addition to monitoring the growth of seedlings, it would also be beneficial to monitor the growth of surrounding Amphibolis beds, the reproductive output of these beds and other relevant aspects of their biology and morphology.

The objective of this project was to create a stable eelgrass population which would grow into a source for further recovery and expansion. In order to select optimal locations for transplantation and protection, actual eelgrass beds in the Wadden Sea were monitored, a communication strategy was implemented and a seagrass map (for both Z. marina and Z. noltii) was developed with a Habitat Suitability Model. During the planting phase, transplantation depth and size and density of planting units were varied in order to optimize the successful establishment of new seedlings.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry In the beginning of the 1930s, the robust type of eelgrass vanished completely from the Wadden Sea. during the “˜wasting disease’ epidemic that affected eelgrass populations worldwide. The natural recovery of eelgrass was poor, probably due to intensive engineering activities (e.g. Nienhuis and de Bree, 1977; Nienhuis, 1983; Reise, 1985), poor visibility in the water column, fishery activities (Giesen, 1990ab; de Jonge et al., 2000) and increased nutrient loads in the 1970s and 1980s (van Katwijk et al., 1997, 1999, 2000). By that time, the abundance of eelgrass in the Wadden Sea had been reduced by more than 99% since the 1930s (de Jonge et al., 2000). Seagrasses were commonly found in Dutch coastal waters well into the 20th century. At that time, the fields of Eelgrass (Zostera marina) in the Wadden Sea extended over a total area of between 65 and 150 square kilometres. There were two types of eelgrass–a robust type occurring below mean sea level (MSL) and a flexible type occurring in the intertidal zone. The main objective of the experiment is to re-establish a self-sustaining eelgrass population in the western Wadden Sea, which will form the source for further expansion to other parts of the Dutch Wadden Sea.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The stakeholders of the Wadden Sea area include politicians, civil servants, managers, interested citizens, NGO’s and the press.

Description of Project Activities: The first step in the implementation of the project was to select planting locations in the western Wadden Sea. Sites were selected using the following criteria: (1) eelgrass used to grow naturally in the selected area in the past; (2) the area should have natural protection against prevailing winds; (3) the area should have some freshwater input; (4) no fishing activities or bait digging should be allowed in or in the proximity of the area. Balgzand, a tidal area of approximately 6,000 hectares in the western Wadden Sea, was ultimately chosen to be the main area for the project, as it fits all the selection criteria.

Specific transplantation areas within Balgzand were chosen on the basis of a few additional criteria (van Katwijk and Wijgergangs, 2004): (1) sediment should be stable and not too coarse; (2) depth of the location should be between +15 and -20cm MSL; (3) wave exposure should be slight; (4) drainage should be moderate, with a film of water remaining on the tidal flats during low tide. The salinity at the selected transplantation site was about 24 PSU.

The seedlings that were to be used for transplantation were collected at the tidal area Hond/Paap in the Ems Estuary of the eastern Dutch Wadden Sea. Seedlings were dug up by hand (only one seedling per 9m2 to guarantee genetic diversity), and were carefully rinsed and transported to the new locations at the temperature of collection. Transplantation to the experimental sites took place on 7 and 8 June 2002, and about 1,500 eelgrass seedlings were initially planted.

A planting unit (PU) consisted of 37 (or 61) seedlings transplanted in a hexagon bed. The mutual distance between two neighboring shoots was constant (in six directions) by the nature of this hexagon shape. Shoot density was set at a mutual distance of 30cm (high density = 14 seedlings - m-2) or 50cm (low density = 5 seedlings - m-2). High density (HD) and low density (LD) PUs were always transplanted in pairs. The imaginary line between the two center points of all pairs of PUs was fixed at 50Â°N to assure similar exposure to the tidal currents.

The transplanted plots were monitored on several occasions, and it was soon evident that survival of the shoots was low. It was learned that incorrect depth data for the experimental sites had been provided, and in July, new seedlings were transplanted to three new locations in the Balgzand area.

This new transplantation was also unsuccessful, probably due to a prolonged period of unfavorable wind direction right after planting. In an effort to compensate for the lack of settled plants, seeding shoots were collected in August and were transplanted in September after a maturation period in the laboratory.

Also in September, stabilization techniques were installed on the experimental location. They consisted of mussel seed, which was deposited on a bed of cockleshells, and wicker screens (as a spare technique). These stabilization techniques were intended to provide shelter for the eelgrass transplants that followed in June 2003, with 1,800 seedlings planted at depths of c.  - 30 cm MSL.

Finally, in June 2004, 1,400 additional seedlings were planted at locations where survival rates had been the highest in 2003. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: After the initial failure due to poor depth data, about 50% of the newly transplanted shoots had grown into eelgrass plants by the end of the growing season at one location. The plants developed reproductive shoots, but no seeds were observed. Moreover, no seedlings were found to develop in spring 2004, probably due to the low seed production.

As a result of the June 2004 planting, about 40% of the new seedlings survived by the end of the growing season and produced reproductive shoots. An intensive study into seed production proved that seeds were present, which supported expectations that developing seedlings were to be found by the spring 2005.

During the course of the present study, survival ranged from 28 to 68% seven weeks after transplantation. Although these surviving plants produced reproductive shoots, winter survival and seedling growth were low. Nevertheless, an intensive study on seed maturation in 2004 showed the existence of relatively high numbers of ripe seeds (Bos et al., 2005). Hopefully this will result in the development of seedlings in 2005. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The initial failure of the transplantation was a result of poor depth data. The elevation of the tidal flats had been measured erroneously, resulting in a transplant at a depth of 22 cm below MSL, instead of at 5 cm below MSL. It is known from literature that conditions at 20 cm below MSL are too dynamic for unprotected eelgrass shoots. 

The second transplant--done in July--also failed, probably due to a prolonged period of unfavorable wind direction right after planting.  A summer transplant is more risky anyway, as the shoots have smaller remaining energy reserves and are thus inhibited from taking root.
The success of transplantation could be affected negatively by local disturbances and therefore it was considered important to simultaneously work in different microhabitats during the eelgrass transplantations. Apart from transplanting at different locations, transplant density, transplant depth and number of shoots per planting unit were varied. High density PUs supported survival of transplants at those locations exposed to waves and currents, whereas planting density had no effect on survival of transplants in sheltered habitats (Bos et al., submitted). Shoots were transplanted at different depths in the safe range. However, none to locally small differences in survival of transplants were observed between depths of +2 and +8cm MSL (Bos et al., 2004; Bos et al., 2005). As mutual protection was expected to affect survival of transplants, the size of PUs was varied (37 or 61 plants). No significant differences were observed though.
Co-occurrence of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and eelgrass has often been described with special emphasis to the protective function of the blue mussel (e.g. van Katwijk and Hermus, 2000). Experiments done by Bouma et al. (subm.) showed that the blue mussel facilitates eelgrass by reducing the drag force on eelgrass shoots when exposed to currents. We tested this relationship at a relatively exposed location and found that transplanted eelgrass shoots had a significantly higher survival in mussel beds than without mussel bed protection (Fig. 3B; Bos et al., submitted). However, all plants disappeared towards the end of the growing season. This suggested that a protective mechanism of the mussel bed was present, but not strong enough to support long-term survival. "

Located on the west coast of Florida, Charlotte Harbor includes eight basins; 1) coastal Venice, 2) Lemon Bay, 3) Charlotte Harbor, 4) Gasparilla Sound, 5) Pine Island Sound, 6) Matlacha Pass, 7) San Carlos Bay, 8) Estero Bay, as well as the Myakka, Peace and the Calloosahatchee rivers. This covers an estimated 4,500 square miles (11,655 square kilometers). In the year 2000 the urban population in this area was reported to be nearing 1.5 million distributed across 16 cities. It is suggested that by 2010 this population is projected to reach an estimated 1.7 million. Consequentially, urban development will grow resulting in increased upstream water consumption furthering the intensive use of boats, cars, and roads threatening the health of coastal habitats. An economically viable estuarine system with respect to fishing, agriculture, mining, tourism, retirement and construction, the Charlotte Harbor and its watershed are considered vitally important assets to the Florida sun coast with a total income of $3.2 billion per annum.
Unique when compared to adjacent Florida estuarine systems, Charlotte Harbor’s system is mostly influenced by its large rivers. For instance, the watershed for the Peace River is 26 times larger than the estuary that it drains into (for every acre of water, 26 acres of land drains into the estuary). Additionally, physical features such as the Barrier islands protect the estuaries and the mainland from damaging storm waves and floods creating still habitat for mangroves, sea-grasses, fish and birds. The Charlotte Harbor estuary and its coastal waters serve as a home, feeding ground and/or nursery area for a number of resident, migrant, and commercial fish species throughout the Gulf of Mexico. Numbers of species throughout the study area include: 452 fish, 331 birds, 2,100 plants, 39 mammals, 67 reptiles, and 27 amphibians – some of which are federally endangered or threatened. As a result, the National Estuary Program (NEP) was established during the mid-1980’s.
In 1987 the National Estuary Program was established by amendments to the Clean Water Act to identify, restore and protect estuaries along the coasts of the United States. On July 6th, 1995 Charlotte Harbor Estuary became an “area of national significance” thus a candidate for the National Estuary Program. Once the Charlotte Harbor was established as a national program, a decision-making team was developed to identify and prioritize the main problems with the estuary.
Although problems found in the estuary and adjacent areas varied geographically in extent and severity, they were relatively uniform throughout the study area. As a result, fifteen quantifiable objectives and 48 priority strategies were developed to address these problems. What they came up with was a 20-year Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) comprised of four committees; 1) The Policy Committee – to establish policy, 2) The Management Committee – oversees the operation of the program, 3) The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) – guided technical decisions, and 4) Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) – represents the interest of the public. Once the Management Plan was completed and accepted by the Management Conference in April of 2000, the State of Florida and the U.S. congress, action to restore and protect the estuarine system started to take place in June of 2001. One main objective within the management plan was to challenge local communities to address water quality, wildlife habitat loss, land use changes, and human-induced changes to river flows to protect uses of the estuary – emphasizing the bottom line that is, when the quality of natural resources diminishes, so does the economy.Agriculture & Livestock, Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Land use changes, including large scale urbanization

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The stakeholders consist of a network of existing public and private organizations in addition to citizen volunteers. The contribution made by each organization and the roles each hold for the duration of the project is determined by: their mission, jurisdiction, legal authority, and budget. These organizations include: The County Governments of Charlotte County, DeSoto County, Hardee County, Highlands County, Lee County, Manatee County, Polk County and Sarasota County, and the Cities/Towns of Arcadia, Bowling Green, Bartow, Fort Meade, Cape Coral, Fort Myers Beach, Fort Myers, Zolfo Springs, Lakeland, North Port, Punta Gorda, Sanibel, Venice, Wauchula and Winter Haven. Also included are the following three regional planning organizations: Central Florida Regional Planning Council; Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council; and Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council. State agencies include: Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund; The Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission; Attorney General; Forestry Division of Agriculture; Education Commissioner and Department; Department of Community Affairs (DCA); The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission; Department of Environmental Protection (DEP); Department of Health (DOH); Department of Transportation (DOT); Florida State Office of Trade and Tourism Development; and the South and Southwest Florida Water Management Districts. Federal Government organizations include: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); Department of Agriculture (DOA); Department of Commerce (DOC); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); Department of Defense (DOD); Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD); Department of Interior (DOI); US Geological Survey (USGS); US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS); Department of Transportation (DOT); and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). And finally, some of the contributing private organizations include: Charlotte Harbor Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida, Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation, Lakes Action/Education Drive, and the Gasparilla Island Conservation and Improvement Association.

Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The large size of the study area creates challenges for managers and citizens alike.  The watershed has both rural and urban characteristics, freshwater and marine ecosystems, tourism and agricultural based economies, and diverse local issues and priorities.  Due to the diversity and size of the Charlotte Harbor watershed, it is often difficult to determine whether changes are caused by natural conditions or human impacts.  When a basin undergoes rapid simultaneous changes such as the construction of canals, the expansion of urban development, and the intensification of agriculture, understanding what and how human activities are effecting water quality, hydrology, and habitat requires a great deal of monitoring and analysis over a long period of time.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-california-eradication-of-the-invasive-seaweed-caulerpa-taxifolia-from-agua-hedionda-lagoon-and-huntington-harbour/	USA: California: Eradication of the Invasive Seaweed Caulerpa Taxifolia from Agua Hedionda Lagoon and Huntington Harbour	United States of America	2000-06-06	2000-06-06	"In the summer of 2000, the first known Western Hemisphere infestations of the invasive strain of the tropical marine alga, Caulerpa taxifolia, were discovered in Agua Hedionda Lagoon, Carlsbad, California and in Huntington Harbour, Huntington Beach, California. Commonly used in saltwater aquarium systems, earlier releases of C. taxifolia into coastal European and Australian waters have resulted in the establishment of extensive dense carpets of the seaweed, smothering diverse natural communities and dramatically reducing biodiversity by displacing native seaweeds and animals. Based on the aggressive nature of this species and the displacement of native marine resources observed upon its discovery in California, it was recognized that the infestations posed a major threat to coastal ecosystems, and recreational and commercial uses dependent upon coastal resources. Therefore, a large-scale, multi-agency eradication effort was undertaken to curb the spread of this prolific invader.Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) The highly invasive aquarium strain of the tropical marine alga Caulerpa taxifolia was discovered in Agua Hedionda Lagoon in June 2000 and later confirmed in July 2000 at a second site in Huntington Harbour, Orange County. These discoveries represented the first known infestations of this strain within the Western Hemisphere (Jousson et al. 2000). The Agua Hedionda Lagoon and Huntington Harbour infestations are believed to have arisen from separate introductions. The resulting infestations were distinctly different due to the physical dissimilarity of the two sites.
When discovered at Agua Hedionda Lagoon, the infestation consisted of numerous dense patches, located primarily where native eelgrass beds had previously existed. Lagoon-wide surveys found approximately 0.13 hectare of C. taxifolia distributed over a 42.3-hectare (104.6-acre) area of the eastern basin. Caulerpa taxifolia was likely released from a home aquarium into the lagoon either directly or though one of the adjacent storm drains.
In Huntington Harbour, the C. taxifolia infestation was located primarily in two shallow artificial ponds
connected to the northern portion of the harbor. The C. taxifolia growth pattern in Huntington Harbour was much different from Agua Hedionda Lagoon, with the alga typically growing as hundreds of small, scattered plants. Because there were few distinct patches with discrete boundaries, quantification of the area covered by each occurrence of C. taxifolia at the site was not possible. All occurrences of C. taxifolia were distributed over a 1.1-hectare (2.6-acre) area. The goals of the SCCAT are the eradication of the known infestations of C. taxifolia, and the prevention and detection of new infestations through outreach and surveillance.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
(see project description)

Description of Project Activities: At the time of its discovery in California, no technique had been demonstrated to effectively eradicate similarly sized C. taxifolia infestations. After initial containment and treatment investigations both in the field and laboratory, application of chlorine bleach proved the most promising treatment.  Bleach was chosen due to its lethal effect on C. taxifolia, readily detectable effect (visual bleaching), ease of application, low cost, and non-toxic residuals. The tendency of C. taxifolia to easily fragment and grow into new plants from even very small fragments dictated that the C. taxifolia should be treated in-place, with minimal disturbance.

Treatment efforts consisted of covering C. taxifolia with heavy black PVC tarps under which chlorine was either injected as sodium hyopchlorite, or placed as a solid, pelleted formulation, which provided full containment of C. taxifolia while minimizing the water quality impacts of the treatment on the surrounding waters. The containment and treatment efforts lasted approximately two years, and intensive surveillance was undertaken concurrently to search for remaining C. taxifolia. These surveys were conducted by closely-spaced divers moving systematically at a measured pace along the bottom.

In order to evaluate the reliability of the surveillance effort at both infestation sites, patches of artificial Caulerpa were placed within each of the two sites during the regular diver surveys. Confidence in the results of each survey for live C. taxifolia could then be quantitatively estimated based on the amount of artificial Caulerpa found during the surveys. The results of these consecutive assessments of the surveys ultimately allowed for an estimation of the eradication certainty, the certainty that all real C. taxifolia existing at the two sites had been found and that eradication had been achieved. The assessments determined that there is a 97.71% certainty that eradication has been achieved at Agua Hedionda Lagoon, assuming the worst conditions, and a 99.86% certainty if the average conditions are assumed. There is a 99.99% certainty that eradication has been achieved at Huntington Harbour under all conditions. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Over the course of the eradication effort at Agua Hedionda Lagoon, hundreds of patches of C. taxifolia were tarped and treated; the largest patch was estimated to have a biomass in excess of 18 metric tons (20 tons) of the alga. The amount of C. taxifolia found in the lagoon was reduced with each consecutive survey, with the coverage in fall 2001, winter 2001, spring 2002, and summer 2002 measuring 33.6 m2, 2.7 m2, 0.5 m2, and 0.4 m2, respectively.

Similarly, at Huntington Harbour there were fewer, and generally smaller, patches of C. taxifolia found in each subsequent survey. The total sizes of patches found in fall 2001, winter 2001, spring 2002, summer 2002, and fall 2002 measured 9.9 m2, 1.2 m2, 1.3 m2, 0.5 m2, and 0.5 m2, respectively.

Caulerpa taxifolia was last detected in Agua Hedionda Lagoon in September 2002 and in Huntington Harbour in November 2002. No C. taxifolia has been discovered at either site during intensive, systematic surveillance conducted through December 2005. Evaluations of the treatment effectiveness have been performed both in the laboratory and at the infestation sites. The laboratory experiments involved the collection of previously infested sediment from under the treatment tarps. The sediment cores were planted into laboratory aquariums and monitored in a controlled study for regrowth of C. taxifolia. No C. taxifolia grew from any of the treated cores. Additionally, removal of portions of the treatment tarps at the infestation sites resulted in no regrowth of C. taxifolia after four years of monitoring. These data indicate that the treatment approach used was lethal to C. taxifolia and that the containment of C. taxifolia at the infestation sites has been achieved. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Recovery was not limited by any factors, as extensive surveys have shown that the eradication was complete.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The infestations posed a major threat to coastal ecosystems, and recreational and commercial uses dependent upon coastal resources.
The following is a list of the critical elements of a successful eradication response: 1) rapid response; 2) assumption and belief that eradication is possible; 3) incorporation of the lessons from other responses; 4) adequate funding to maintain a sustained, persistent response; 5) intensive, repeated surveys over an extended period of time after the last discovery; 6) quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of survey and treatment elements; 7) identification and engagement of stakeholders; 8) adaptation and adjustment to approach in response to financial circumstances, stakeholder response, or independent review. There is wide agreement that the key elements of the C. taxifolia eradication effort were the quick recognition of the threat posed by C. taxifolia, prompt organization of a response team, effective acquisition of funding, and an immediate field response to assess the extent of the infestation and develop a response plan. The need to detect new infestations of Caulerpa, to identify potential sources or pathways of Caulerpa movement, and to prevent new introductions of Caulerpa into California waters requires an effective outreach and education program. The Southern California Caulerpa Outreach and Education Program currently underway is one mechanism to address this need, and it is recommended that similar efforts be initiated and maintained in other coastal regions of the state. This program targets groups such as saltwater aquarists, SCUBA divers, harbor masters, anglers, public aquariums, environmental groups, and governmental agencies.
Additionally, it is recommended that legislative efforts to prevent new introductions of Caulerpa species to the coastal waters of California be continued. Legislation banning the transport, sale, and possession of nine potentially invasive species of Caulerpa, including C. taxifolia, was enacted in the State of California in September 2001 (AB 1334). However, many resource managers, invasive species experts, and SCCAT believe that due to the difficulty associated with distinguishing various species of Caulerpa, a ban on the entire Caulerpa genus is necessary and critical to controlling the importation, distribution, or release of invasive Caulerpa species in California.
It is also recommended that a permanent rapid response fund be established for an effective and immediate response to newly discovered infestations of Caulerpa or other marine invasives, and for increased support of enforcement of existing state laws banning marine invasive species. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-massachusetts-boston-harbor-eelgrass-restoration/	USA: Massachusetts: Boston Harbor Eelgrass Restoration	United States of America	2004-06-05	2007-12-05	"An eelgrass restoration program implemented by the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries is underway in Boston Harbor as a partial mitigation for assumed impacts to marine resources resulting from the HubLine gas pipeline construction which transits the Harbor. The restoration is intended to provide important shallow-water eelgrass habitat to juvenile crustaceans, shellfish, and finfish which commonly inhabit sea grass meadows. Water quality improvements from the secondary treatment and redirection of treated sewage outfalls to an offshore site have resulted in a measurable reversal of environmental degradation within the Harbor. These conditions decrease nutrient loading, particularly nitrogen levels, and thus decrease epiphytic growth and algal blooms, which shade out newly developing eelgrass shoots. Therefore the Boston Harbor environment, with its improved water quality, is a prime candidate for eelgrass restoration. Under the auspices of this project, transplanting and seeding activities were conducted at several sites around the harbor.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Loss of eelgrass habitat due to anthropogenic impacts on the Massachusetts coastal marine ecosystem has been extensive. Coastal development, severe organic loading, and siltation in many areas of the inner and outer Harbor have resulted in loss of eelgrass meadows. This project is intended to restore eelgrass habitat to Boston Harbor in order to improve the abundance of juvenile marine resources and larger forage species.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Eelgrass Restoration Project has worked closely with many local agencies and federal entities in the implementation of this restoration effort. The Town Conservation Commissions, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Massachusetts Historical Commission, and the Board of Underwater Archaeological Resources were all involved in the permitting process.
Project coordinators have also conducted public outreach initiatives in order to stimulate interest in the project and secure the volunteer assistance upon which it relies. Participation and support has been drawn from such diverse groups as the National Park Service, the New England Aquarium, several Boston area high schools, Earthwatch Institute, and members of the local business community. This volunteer participation, along with educational programs developed for community activities, ensures that the project will enhance public awareness of important local issues and promote stewardship into the future.

Description of Project Activities: The task of selecting potential transplant areas in Boston Harbor involved the collation and evaluation of available Boston area environmental data and the augmentation of these data with in situ environmental monitoring. Each of the four existing eelgrass beds in Boston Harbor was examined for depth, salinity, water temperature, light attenuation, and sediment type. The potential project sites were then visited and evaluated for their suitability. Sites deemed appropriate for transplanting were then planted with test plots.

Test transplants were accomplished by first harvesting eelgrass shoots from donor sites in Revere and Nahant, north of the harbor. Wire mesh ""cages"" called TERFsâ„¢ (24"" square) were used to plant shoots. Twenty-five pairs of shoots were tied to each TERFâ„¢, and four TERFsâ„¢ were deployed in a square pattern at each of the twelve sites. These sites were monitored and evaluated for survival rates. In addition, shoot density counts were taken along transects in harvested beds off Revere and Nahant, and in unharvested control sites in order to ensure that harvesting was not negatively impacting the existing beds. The twelve test transplant sites were monitored for survival and general health, and the four best sites were selected for further planting. The chosen sites are off of Long Island and Peddocks Island, and in Lower Neck Cove in Weymouth.

In 2005, a total of about 21,000 shoots were planted with the help of volunteers from around the community. A new planting technique was also developed using a lighter, modified version of the TERFâ„¢. In lieu of wiremesh, our modified TERFâ„¢ is a 1/4 m square, 3/4 "" PVC pipe frame holding stretched jute (landscape) mesh to which shoots are tied. The PVC frames are anchored to the bottom with 10"" spikes driven through holes drilled in the corners. Upon deployment and rooting of attached shoots, the jute can be easily cut from the inside of the frame, leaving it to biodegrade while the frames are retrieved for reuse.

We used only PVC frames at the Weymouth site, where hand planting would reduce visibility by stirring up soft sediment. Hand planting was also used exclusively at Peddocks Island, where gravel prevents frames from lying flat against the bottom. Both methods were used at Long Island where the sediment is sandy.

A checkerboard pattern of transplanting was used at the Peddocks and Long Island sites, whereby we alternated 18 planted 1/4 m2 quadrats with 18 unplanted quadrats. This pattern, adapted from a restoration technique used by Save the Bay, Rhode Island, is designed to cover more ground than continuous planting of shoots, while providing voids for eelgrass to fill naturally. The Long Island site contains 8 of these grids, 4 each along two 150 m transects, bounding approximately one acre. The Peddocks site contains 4 grids, and encompasses a little under half an acre.

At all of these sites, additional plots were added in 2006. Two additional sites, one off of Long Island and the one off of Peddocks Island, were also added in 2006, and another additional site will be added off of Peddocks Island later this year. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The Long and Peddocks Island sites looked very healthy with vigorous new growth following the winter of 2005. However, the Weymouth bed gradually deteriorated and was eliminated from future plantings. Shoots there appear unhealthy, and it is possibly the result of unsuitable sediment and light attenuation caused by silt resuspension. 

By July 2006, the checkerboard planting pattern at the Peddocks site had filled in to the point where it was no longer possible to distinguish the original squares.

Biological monitoring was conducted to determine whether our transplanted beds provided similar habitat value to naturally occurring beds. Several indices were used to compare areas transplanted in 2005 and 2006 with a nearby unvegetated Control site, an existing but declining bed in Boston Harbor (Hull), and a healthy existing bed off Nahant. Benthic infauna have not yet been analyzed, but, based on all other measures, our 2005 transplanted beds compared favorably to the Hull bed, and exceeded even the Nahant bed in epifaunal and demersal species richness. As one may expect, 2006 transplant sites have not yet achieved the habitat value of a natural bed based on these indices. However, eelgrass beds planted to date have exhibited significant growth and sufficient density to attract a number of organisms. Among faunal sightings are spider crabs (Libinia emarginata), grubbies (Myxocephalus aeneus), rock crabs (Cancer irroratus), Jonah crabs (Cancer borealis), juvenile winter flounders (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), lumpfish, lobsters, pipefish, green crabs, hermit crabs, and small invertebrates such as mysid shrimp.

Seeds planted during the fall of 2005 at the Southwest Long Island (LIS) and Southeast Peddocks sites had a low initial germination rate (<1%) when first checked in the spring of 2006. However, further germination and spreading continued through the spring, and have generated extensive eelgrass beds. The bed at LI S in particular is thriving, and covers over 175 square meters, a far larger area than our shoot-transplanted plots. In addition, the plots we planted with shoots in fall 2005 produced seed shoots by summer 2006, which will help to expand those beds. The entire area between planted plots at LIS is now dotted with tufts of eelgrass shoots that have apparently been seeded from last year's transplants. The seed bed at LIS now covers 3100 m2, about 500 m2 of which is quite dense. Shoot density and areal coverage at the plots transplanted in 2006 have increased between 200 and 300%. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Initially, project practitioners had hoped to nurture a transplant site along the mainland. At this point, however, the Boston Harbor mainland perimeter has been largely eliminated due to its poor potential for supporting eelgrass. This is primarily due to the presence of black, anoxic sediment and/or fine-grained silty sediment, which likely resulted from extensive pre-outfall organic loading. In general, the sediment surrounding some of the islands is more promising for eelgrass transplantation.
Shoots were planted successfully by hand and also with PVC/jute frames to which shoots had been tied. However, the jute attracted macroalgae over the winter. The frames were removed in early spring along with as much algae as possible from the plots. The growth at these plots was subsequently comparable to hand-planted plots and consequently, hand planting has become the mainstay of transplant operations. That being said, frame planting does provide opportunities for valuable community outreach and involvement, as shore-side volunteers (i.e. non-divers) can participate in and learn about the project. It is hoped that annual monitoring, at least of areal coverage, will continue, but it depends on the availability of personnel. "

Culebra is the main island in an archipelago of 22 smaller islands that has been designated the Culebra National Wildlife Refuge due to its importance as a sanctuary for many common and endangered species of birds, fish and sea turtles. The mangroves of Culebra were severely impacted by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and they failed to recover naturally. Thus, this project–implemented by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in collaboration with local government and community organizations–sought to help rejuvenate and restore this sensitive mangrove ecosystem. It is hoped that these mangroves will stabilize the shoreline and provide protection during future storms but more importantly, that they will nurture healthy coastal and marine ecosystems for the benefit of the wildlife that calls the Refuge home.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry In late 1989, Hurricane Hugo slammed into the Island of Culebra in Puerto Rico. The storm severely damaged or destroyed coastal mangrove forests in and around Puerto del Manglar. Initially, these mangrove forests were left alone in an attempt to allow them to regenerate naturally. However, after three years these trees were not regrowing and it was apparent that significant efforts would be needed to restore this important component of the Culebra coastal ecosystem. More than 13 species of seabirds–including Laughing Gulls, White-tailed and Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies, and Sooty, Roseate and Bridled Terns–find their way to the Culebra Refuge each year to breed and nurture their young. The largest breeding colony, numbering over 15,000 birds, is the Sooty Tern colony located on Flamenco Peninsula. While the majority of species nesting in the area are migratory and are present only from May to September, others breed throughout the year. These include three species of boobies and frigatebirds. The mangroves of Puerto de Manglar attract marine feeders such as Tri-colored, Little Blue and Great Blue Herons. They also serve as roosts and nesting sites for Cattle Egrets, Yellow-crowned Night Herons, Scaley-naped Pigeons, White-crowned Pigeons and endangered Brown Pelicans.
Not only is the Culebra Refuge an important sanctuary for birds, three species of sea turtles–Leatherback, Hawksbill and Green–use the waters surrounding Culebra and nest on refuge beaches. Restoration of this site was initiated in order to help maintain the ecological web of the area after Hurricane Hugo’s severe damage to the forests in 1989.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
This project was planned and implemented in collaboration with local and federal government entities, as well as representatives from local educational institutions, local non-governmental organizations and members of the community.

Description of Project Activities: In the transplant area, most of the dead trees were cleared, but some were left to serve as breakwaters for new trees and help them get established. Propagules were then collected from an unaffected red mangrove forest on the southwest coast of Puerto Rico and transplanted at the newly cleared site. Through the cooperative efforts of Coastal America partners, University of Puerto Rico personnel, and citizens groups, approximately 4,000 seedlings were planted at Culebra. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: This planting effort helped to restore one of the most environmentally sensitive and important areas in Culebra. At the completion of the project, over 20 acres of fringe red mangrove, Rhizophora mangle, were restored and approximately 15,000 feet of the shoreline had been replanted.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The restoration of the fringe mangrove forest will result in significant environmental benefits when the trees mature. Mangrove roots stabilize the shoreline, thus protecting inland areas during storms and hurricanes. Mangroves also prevent resuspension of fine sediments, thus improving water quality for sea turtles, fish and sessile organisms such as oysters, seagrass beds, and coral reefs. Furthermore, mangrove trees provide foraging, nesting, and roosting habitat for many important species of shorebirds.

Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of the project was the educational experience it provided for the volunteers, students and employees involved in its implementation. The importance of these coastal mangroves and their relationship to the overall health of the aquatic environment was made apparent to a large segment of a small community that often takes its environment for granted.
Although the project could have been conducted by a single agency, the support and desire for its accomplishment by several agencies and individuals made the probability for success much greater and definitively enhanced the scope of the project. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-minnesota-sugarloaf-cove-lake-superior/	USA: Minnesota: Sugarloaf Cove (Lake Superior)	United States of America	1998-01-01	2000-12-31	"This site represents the historical location of a rare wetland on the north shore of Lake Superior. From the 1940s to the 1970s, Sugarloaf Cove was used as a landing site for a pulpwood operation. The site was leveled and low-lying areas were filled with gravel in order to build roads and buildings. Even though the buildings were removed after the industrial use was completed, the wetlands at Sugarloaf Cove could not return because the topography onsite had been altered so radically. In 1998, a restoration project began to excavate gravel and plant native plants onsite. By the completion of this project in 2000, the topography and flora onsite had been returned to a more natural state. Educational opportunities are provided by the nearby Sugarloaf Cove Interpretive Center.Mining & Resource Extraction From the 1940s to the 1970s, Sugarloaf Cove was used by Consolidated Papers, Inc. as a pulpwood landing. They collected the logs here before they rafted them across Lake Superior. The site was modified from its original state by the paper company removing vegetation and filling in many of the low areas in with gravel to build roads and buildings. Even after the site was not longer used as a landing for Consolidated Papers and they removed the buildings, no wetland plants could return due to the fact that the tightly packed gravel would not allow water to collect or wetland plants to grow. Non-native plants colonized the disturbed areas. This area contained many low-lying, wetland areas which provided habitat for many species of wetland plants and animals. Since wetlands are rare along the North Shore of Lake Superior, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources decided to restore Sugarloaf Cove to the wetland community that existed prior to the disturbance brought on by industrial use.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: - 18 geotechnical borings were made to determine what plants had been originally part of the wetland community
 - Another study was conducted to determine that best areas within the tombolo that had a high potential for restoration
 - In September of 1999, gravel fill was removed down to the buried peat layer, resulting in low-lying areas were water could collect
 - An old road from where the Consolidated Papers office building were located was eliminated
 - Silt fences, brush, and logs were placed throughout the areas to minimize erosion
 - Native seeds were collected within a 25 mile radius of Sugarloaf Cove""”native plants that do well in disturbed areas were emphasized
 - Some seed were spread immediately on the restored site and others were grown to be planted the following spring
 - In late May 2000, volunteers planted the wetland area
 - Exclosures were created around plants in some areas to make sure they plants had time to grow before then animals could eat them
 - With landowner permission, plants from nearby were transplanted
 - The plants were watered as needed 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The topography and hydrology has been altered to mimic a more natural situation.  Native plants have been planted. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Seedling survival depends on natural conditions such as competition from invasive weeds, browsing by animals, and weather conditions.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: This restored site provides better ecosystem function as well as educational opportunities through the Sugarloaf Cove Interpretive Center.
This restoration has successfully remedied the original cause of degredation. As long as the planted vegetation continues to survive, this site is likely to be successful in transforming this site into a functioning ecosystem. The cause of degradation was the filling in of low-lying areas with gravel. This has been reversed and native plants carefully introduced.
Long-term monitoring plans are unknown. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/pakistan-mangrove-restoration-through-the-korangi-ecosystem-project/	Pakistan: Mangrove Restoration through The Korangi Ecosystem Project	Pakistan	1991-01-01	1991-01-01	"The Korangi Ecosystem Project was set up to develop a management plan for the two major creeks adjacent to Karachi–Korangi and Phitti Creek. These creeks cover about 60,000 hectares and have some of the densest growth of mangroves, near the largest concentrations of people (100,000), on the northern edge of the Indus Delta. Project activities include surveys and models of mangrove distribution and biodiversity, establishment of extensive mangrove plantations, and community education and awareness programs aimed at stabilizing the relationship between local economies and ecosystems. Originally intended to be used as a model for sustainable management in the Indus Delta as a whole, the Korangi Project now serves as a model for mangrove rehabilitation efforts, not only in Pakistan, but in other coastal areas, including the Persian Gulf, Red Sea and some areas in South East Asia.Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Over the past 13 years, the degradation of Pakistan’s mangroves has occurred at the rate of 6 percent per annum. As a result, only 16 percent of Pakistan’s mangroves are thought to be healthy (Qureshi, 1992). The most harmful environmental stress that the mangroves face today derives largely from human activity. The steady growth of a major industrial city within the vicinity (Karachi) has brought an influx of untreated sewage and industrial discharge, an increase in the demand for fuel wood, overgrazing and general over-exploitation of resources. Steel mills, refineries and power stations are some of the large polluting industries found in the area. Tanneries are perhaps the worst, though. Their untreated effluents, massively loaded with heavy metals, are being disposed daily into the sea, thereby contaminating the food chain. High concentrations of heavy metal such as lead, zinc, copper, nickel, cadmium, mercury and cobalt have recently been recorded in marine biota and sediments (Davis, 1993).
Increasing salinity and a reduction of incoming freshwater flows also threaten the survival of the mangrove ecosystem. The estimated available freshwater flow of the Indus Delta is about 180 billion-mÂ³, carrying with it some 400 million tones of silt. However, construction of dams and irrigation channels has reduced the annual flow that reaches the mangroves to less than 43 billion mÂ³ (Davis, 1993). The resulting spike in salinity levels has severely degraded the ecosystem and has decimated less salt-tolerant species. The Indus Delta mangrove ecosystem is dominated by a single species, Avicennia marina (representing over 95% of the trees), although a few stands of Ceriops tagal, Bruguiera conjugata and Aegiceras corniculatum also exist. The predominance of A. marina is thought to be a result of its resistance against adverse environmental conditions and over-exploitation of the other species. In fact, Rhizophora mucronata once grew in the delta but it is thought to have died out due to selective over-exploitation and degrading conditions.
Over 150 species of fish have thus far been recorded in the mangroves, and shrimp, crabs, egrets, cormorants, storks, seagulls, herons and kites are also abundant. Moreover, the delta mangroves are visited each year by millions of migrating waterfowl–pelicans, flamingos and herons among them. The primary goal of IUCNP’s effort is to assess biological feasibility for large scale reintroduction of mangroves along Pakistan’s coastline and to facilitate the establishment of extensive mangrove plantations as a part of the Mangrove rehabilitation programme.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Major stakeholders in this project include the Governments of Sindh and Balochistan, local government entities, such as the Forests and Fisheries Departments, Karachi Development Authority, and the Port Qasim Authority, representatives from local business and industry, representatives from Academia and research institutions, and community members who depend on the mangroves for various resources and commodities.

Description of Project Activities: Normally low lying open areas and mud flats are selected for new plantations. These areas get regular flushing by sea water, and the seedlings or saplings have little difficulty in developing root systems. There are different techniques for planting the various species. The most common method is direct planting of the propagules / seeds in the mud flats.

The seeds of Avicennia marina and Aegiceras corniculatum are very small and easily washed away by the currents. Indeed, this is their normal means of dispersal. For cultivation, however, these species are easily raised in containers and then the seedlings are transplanted into the field after six months to a year.

An A marina plantation can be raised by three methods: deep pitting, trenching and broadcasting of the seed. In the case of the site having a coverage of Porteresia grass, the broadcasting method is most economical and effective. The number of seeds per hectare should be about 6000 and the average rate of successful germination is about 60%. The trench method is the most appropriate when the area has degraded due to over cutting, overgrazing or accumulation of salt on the high-lying areas. The seedlings receive seawater regularly from the creek at high tide through a ""˜herring bone' system of trenches. A marina seed may be planted in pits, which serve to retain the water and protect the seed from being washed away, when the areas are medium-lying and submersion occurs regularly at high tide. In all methods the success rates varies from 75 to 90% provided the site has been selected correctly. An alternative method of protecting seeds of A marina is by covering the planted seed with a plastic pot, with its top opened for light and air. After eight days, when germination has taken place, the pot is removed and reused. This effectively protects the seeds from being washed away until the roots have begun to form.

The propagules of Rhizophora mucronata and Ceriops tagal are long and thin and can be planted directly into the field. However, for planting these species under special conditions container saplings may also be raised in an inter-tidal nursery. The size of a container plant nursery is normally 15 m by 15 m, which is large enough to allow beds to be prepared containing some 30,000 plants. Such nurseries are protected by an earthen embarkment against wind and water currents but with an inlet and outlet for natural irrigation by the tide. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Innovative planting and nursery techniques have been developed, and over 6000 hectares of degraded land has now been rehabilitated through the establishment of mangrove plantations. Although four species of mangroves--and a few exotic species with value in the local economy--were planted, Avicennia marina and Rhizophora mucronata constitute about 95% of the artificial plantation in the delta.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The mangrove forests serve the functions of coastline stabilization and protection of ports against natural disasters. They also form an integral component of the economy of coastal communities, providing fuel wood, fodder and various other products. In addition to these direct uses, mangroves constitute a significant part of the productivity base of several important fisheries. Pakistan has a large and lucrative prawn fishery, generating annual revenues of around USD 60 million. An estimated 70% of the Pakistan prawn fishery is dependent on mangroves. The situation is similar with respect to fish. Around 155 species of fish have been recorded from the mangroves of Pakistan, many of them of commercial importance. The export of marine fish, shrimp, lobsters and crabs help the national economy earn Rs.2.2 billion annually, besides providing employment and livelihood to more than 100,000 people associated with the fishing industry. If the mangroves are degraded, much of the 250,000 tons of fish caught off the Sindh Coast will be at risk. Therefore, restoration is crucial to the long-term success and viability of Pakistan's coastal economies.
In terms of managing relatively pristine environments, this is no longer possible in Pakistan. The ecosystems represented are still significant and unique, both in terms of size and in the ecological services they provide, but they are nevertheless stressed by natural and man-made forces. Under such circumstances, ‘wise use’ means finding ways and means of mitigating such forces, and ‘helping’ the ecosystem to adapt without losing its essential character.
It has to be recognized that environmental stresses are inevitable. In the context of the Indus Delta, the reality is that the Indus is not the river it once was. Population pressures will further increase the demand for drinking, industrial and agricultural water supplies. The project should therefore look towards developing a strategy with this in mind; e.g. by planting species or strains which appear to have greater salt tolerance, and by concentrating planting efforts in areas where there is likely to be more freshwater and nutrient availability.
It is also important to provide local users with non-destructive economic uses of the resource–e.g. honey production, fuelwood production, appropriate shrimp culture, and wildlife tourism–as well as encouraging the use of alternative sources of fuelwood and fodder. Any sustainable ecosystem management initiative must have the support of the local population which depends upon the resource. Alongside the forestry programme, therefore, a community development programme is being set up as part of the Korangi Ecosystem Project. One example, which the project is currently testing, is the production of mangrove honey. If honey production in the mangroves is viable during the flowering season, which occurs at the same time as the slack fishing season, an alternative source of income can be promoted. This will have two benefits: (a) it will increase the awareness of the usefulness of the mangroves, and (b) pressure on fish stocks may be reduced.
Another component of the forestry programme is social forestry. This has the objective of taking pressure off the mangroves by providing alternative trees for fruit, fodder and fuelwood for local villagers. Through IUCN, a mass scale planting programme of mangrove species was launched in the coastal villages. Soils in these villages are rather saline, and the production of fuelwood and fodder from mangroves may be higher than from alternative trees.
Early on it became clear that the fundamental issue about the long-term survival of the mangroves in the Indus Delta is the availability of freshwater, silt and nutrients from the river. As a follow-up to this, the project is developing a study to investigate freshwater balances in several different creek areas in the Delta and compare the mangrove cover and density. This may help to answer the fundamental question of how much freshwater the mangroves need and to thus ensure the selection of viable sites for replanting. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-florida-restoration-of-the-tampa-bay-ecosystem/	USA: Florida: Restoration of the Tampa Bay Ecosystem	United States of America	1972-05-31	1972-05-31	"Tampa Bay was designated an “estuary of national significance” by Congress in 1990, paving the way for development of a long-term blueprint for bay restoration through the Tampa Bay Estuary Program. The TBEP, guided by its Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan and working together with various formal and informal partners, has launched a long-term restoration effort aimed at revitalizing the entire Tampa Bay ecosystem. Thus far, strides have been made in reducing the amount of nitrogen reaching bay waters from sources of pollution upstream; restoring coastal wetlands and benthic habitats, including 1,000 hectares of seagrass beds; working with local government and industry representatives to reduce the impact from dredging activities; and developing a public outreach and education component that aims to create an informed and interested citizenry. This project is ongoing and encompasses plans for continuing restoration, including the restoration of 100 acres of low-salinity tidal marsh every five years.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The Tampa Bay estuary and watershed is an urban/suburban estuary ecosystem, with more than 2.3 million people living in the three counties that directly border it. Home development along the shore, domestic and industrial waste discharges, and increasing demands for fresh water are all contributing factors in the bay’s degradation. Dredging and filling activities associated with the three ports on the bay represent another significant anthropogenic pressure on local ecosystems. Tampa Bay is a rich mosaic of fish and wildlife habitats that supplies life-sustaining links in an ecosystem as biologically productive as some of the world’s most celebrated rain forests. As many as 40,000 pairs of birds–from the familiar brown pelican to the colorful roseate spoonbill–nest in Tampa Bay every year. Others, including sandpipers and white pelicans, are seasonal visitors, and the bay is also home to dolphins, sea turtles, and manatees. From coastal mangroves and marshes to underwater meadows of seagrass, from the open bay to the salty mouth of the Gulf of Mexico, each interdependent habitat plays a vital role.
As a nursery environment, seagrasses support small fish, shrimp, and crabs that hide among the blades and feast on decaying leaves. Seagrasses also help stabilize shifting sands on the bottom of the bay and improve water clarity by trapping fine sediments and particles. Turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) is the most common seagrass in Tampa Bay, accounting for 42 percent of total seagrass coverage, but shoal grass (Halodule wrightii) and manatee grass (Syringodium filiforme) are also present.
Three species of mangroves are common in Tampa Bay. Red mangroves are typically located closest to the water, and mounds of oysters frequently colonize at their base. Black mangroves and white mangroves are also present along the bay, with white mangroves often occupying the highest elevations of the three species.
Besides seagrass and mangrove communities, salt marshes, which are composed of salt-tolerant rushes, sedges, and grasses, occur along the shorelines of Tampa Bay in areas where wave action is minimal. These marshes, which periodically become submerged, nourish and protect many fish and animals. They also buffer upland areas from storms and help filter pollutants that run off the land.
Mud flats around the bay’s fringe are exposed at low tide. Although these flats are barren of visible vegetation, they are teeming with life. Small crabs, clams, and worms, which burrow in the mud, supply a veritable feast for birds wading at low tide. (1) Restoration of 5,000 ha of tropical seagrass meadows; (2) Restore 8 ha per year of tidal marsh, and oligohaline marsh habitat, and preserve the remaining mangrove forests; (3) Develop and implement a no-net-gain in nitrogen discharge to the bay program and (4) Development and implementation of management and restoration plans for all of the sub-watersheds draining to Tampa Bay.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Local government agencies and community groups have worked alongside environmental NGOs and national government entities to plan, design, implement and oversee restoration activities in the Tampa Bay ecosystem. Members of the local community also have an interest in this project, however, as the bay has become an important contributor to local economic, recreation and education activities.

Description of Project Activities: As a comprehensive ecosystem restoration and management initiative, the Tampa Bay Estuary Program encompasses many different project activities. Mapping the bay was an important antecedent for much of the restoration work, as models of the natural and anthropogenic processes influencing the ecosystem are indispensable to attempts at reversing degradation. Maps and models of bay habitat, water quality and urbanization were created and then integrated in hopes of gaining a more complete understanding of the interactions that affect the ecosystem as a whole.

Water quality assessments have been another important aspect of the ongoing work in Tampa Bay. Research has focused on locating and quantifying groundwater, analyzing sediments, identifying contaminants, and evaluating surface water quality and circulation. These hydrologic investigations have informed and guided subsequent habitat-specific projects.

Besides maps of the bay and water quality assessments, models of the bay's history and prehistory were also created as guides for restoration work. These models of the bay's evolution have greatly assisted practitioners in predictive modeling and restoration planning, as they help differentiate natural impacts from anthropogenic ones. 

With conceptual data from which to draw, practitioners have undertaken a variety of actual restoration efforts within the bay. Sandbars, seagrass beds, and coastal wetlands have all been targeted for restoration. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: 1000 hectares of persistent seagrass meadows have been restored through water quality improvements. In addition, one hundred hectares of tidal marsh, mangrove forests and oligohaline marsh have been restored by the Surface Water Improvement and Management Program (SWIM) of the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Restoring seagrass by hand, and through mechanical planting techniques, largely failed. Natural recolonization due to water quality improvements is the primary reason for approximately 1000 hectares of new seagrass meadows in the bay.

Additional progress toward the restoration of seagrass meadows will require the reconstruction of the historic longshore bar system in the bay. This needed restoration goal was not apparent until recent years, when progress towards the goal of 5000 hectares of seagrass restoration was stymied.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Tampa Bay is a vital component of the region's economic well-being. Its beauty attracts millions of tourists each year, its bounty lures anglers, sailors and nature enthusiasts from around the world, and its deep-water ports support a bustling maritime industry. Thus, restoration of the bay promises to protect a vital natural resource and safeguard the economic benefits upon which the region depends.
The restoration of Tampa Bay has shown that large-scale estuarine ecosystem restoration takes time and money, and requires a “bottom-up” (i.e., citizen-stakeholder talking to government) commitment first, followed by a “top-down” (i.e., government talking to the citizen-stakeholders) commitment later. Both are essential, but “top-down” by itself did not work in the Tampa Bay case study in its initial phases, and likely will not work elsewhere. Citizen-stakeholders, commonly formed into environmental NGO’s, started the process in the Tampa Bay estuary. It was not a “successful government initiative” alone. The Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) has developed a management plan entitled “Charting the Course.” With this plan, the program intends to further the ongoing restoration of the bay and mitigate future anthropogenic impacts.
One important facet of the plan is to address water quality throughout the watershed. Restoring water quality, and thus overall habitat vitality, will be a critical measure to increase the number, diversity and health of the bay’s fish and wildlife populations. Toward this end, program participants will work with representatives from local government and industry to achieve a reduction in the amount of nitrogen that finds its way into the bay. Another goal aimed at improving water quality is to establish and maintain adequate freshwater flows to Tampa Bay and its tributaries, thereby revitalize tidal streams and marshes. Finally, TBEP plans a concerted effort to better understand the impact of air pollution on water quality and to address the sources of pollution.
Because Tampa Bay is fringed with increasing urban development, enforcement activities will also be crucial to the long-term success of the restoration effort. Therefore, as part of the management plan, on-the-water enforcement of fishing and environmental regulations will be emphasized. Moreover, establishing and enforcing manatee protection zones will also become a priority.
With three ports on bay waters, including the tenth largest port in the United States, dredging and filling activities will continue. Therefore, part of the long-term strategy for effective management of the bay is to implement a dredging plan that will minimize environmental impacts and maximize beneficial uses of the dredged material.
Finally, environmental education is intended to play an important role in the maintenance of a healthy bay ecosystem. TBEP ultimately hopes to establish a public education program that will help create an engaged constituency of citizens who understand both the environmental and economic value of Tampa Bay, and actively participate in restoring and protecting it.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-louisiana-bayou-la-branche-wetlands-restoration-st-charles-parish/	USA: Louisiana: Bayou La Branche Wetlands Restoration (St. Charles Parish)	United States of America	1993-11-02	1994-04-17	"This site used to brackish marshland on the southwestern shore of Lake Pontchartrain. Bayou La Branche served as a barrier to wave action by Lake Pontchartrain. It also provided filtering of contaminants and habitat for wildlife and fish. This site was levied and pumped in the early 1900s, converting the land to use by agriculture. When a hurricane broke the levee, this site filled with water. Wetland vegetation was never able to re-establish on site due to the fact that the water was too deep to support emergent vegetation. In 1993-1994, about 2.7 million cubic yards of sediment were taken from Lake Pontchartrain and put into Bayou La Branche. This project has been successful. Approximately 305 acres of shallow water habitat has been created. Managers expect the project to favorably progress as the sediment settles further and becomes a better elevation for emergent vegetation. Monitoring continues on this site.Agriculture & Livestock In the 1800s, the building of railroad tracks nearby created a barrier to drainage and sheetflow from the upland areas, altering the hydrology of the area. In the early 1900s the site was levied and pumped for agricultural use. This caused subsidence of the site. When a hurricane broke the levee in 1915, this former marsh became a large, open-water pond. In the 1960s, the construction of Interstate 10, adjacent to the site) altered the drainage of the area further, leading to more water flowing from Lake Pontchartrain into the site. Two hurricanes in the 1960s flooded the area further, killing even more marsh-adapted plants. Subsidence and flooding has continued through the years. Until restoration, only a very thin strip of marsh was left between the pond (which ad been marsh) and Lake Pontchartrain. This area was a brackish marsh with emergent vegetation. This site had very little open water and supported many different types of marsh plant species. To be successful, this site will need to be filled in to a level that emergent vegetation can grow. The sediment that is put into the site will have to settle and native plants and animals will have to colonize the area. The goal for this project was to re-create the marsh that used to exist on this site. Specifically, project managers wanted to create an area of 70% land and 30% water within 5 years of construction. This would create approximately 305 acres of shallow water habitat. Once fully restored, this site will be an important buffer between the upland areas and Lake Pontchartrain, and will be habitat for many species.
This site was chosen for restoration, in part, because it was near to Lake Pontchartrain, the source of sediment. Also, this site is near Interstate 10, making the restoration efforts highly visible. This site will be monitored to evaluate the effectiveness of restoration.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: - An earthen berm was created around the site for water containment
 - Segments were removed from the barriers between the two project ponds and the exterior, which allows the water to flow more naturally and recreates a tidal system 
 - Approximately 2.7 million cubic yards of sediment were dredged from Lake Pontchartrain
 - This sediment is expected to settle to a height that is conducive to marsh vegetation
 - The sediment was aerially seeded with Echinochloa crusgalli to stabilize the sediment and enhance volunteer plant growth
 - In the future, wetland plants may be planted onsite
 - Monitoring of sediment elevation, soil characteristics, and vegetation will continue until 2012 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: By 1997, 300 acres of open water had been converted to land (80% land, 20% water), which exceeded the original goal.  The sediment has settled to a level that was thought to be acceptable to wetland plants, but as of the last report, many wetland species were still absent the areas.  Scientists believe that the sediment will need to settle further before many of the wetland species are able to invade the area.  Monitoring has shown that the habitat value of this marsh is improving with time. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Physically, the sediment must settle into the correct elevation to support emergent plants.

All of the structures officially built on this project have worked as anticipated.  However, a local duck club created illegal weirs and blocked drainages on one section of the project to make it better waterfowl habitat.  These structures prevented the outflow of water during low tides and impeded sediment settling.  The structures were removed in 1999, but that area of the project is still dealing with soil elevations that are too high for emergent vegetation.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: This site can provide habitat for fish that are valuable both commercially and recreationally.  This site also serves to filter out pollution and contaminants as well as buffer interior zones.  Finally, this restored project is aesthetically pleasing.
This project succeeded in reducing the water level in the project area, thus providing acceptable conditions for emergent vegetation. No additional work is planned on this project. The main problem, which was subsidence, was corrected. As conditions improve, more species will occupy the site. Monitoring will continue at least until 2012. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/vietnam-wetlands-restoration-in-the-tram-chim-national-park-dong-thap-province/	Vietnam: Wetlands Restoration in the Tram Chim National Park (Dong Thap Province)	Vietnam	2007-05-30	2007-05-30	"The Plain of Reeds was a vast freshwater floodplain ecosystem along the Mekong River delta in southern Vietnam. This area used to remain covered with shallow water (30 – 100 cm) for 3 to 6 months during the rainy season. This area has been changed due to human activities such as irrigation canals and agriculture. During the American-Vietnam war, this area was drained by the U.S. army so that it could be dried and burned to reduce cover. This effort destroyed the natural flood cycle of the wetlands. They drying of the soil also caused the soil pH to become highly acidic due to the oxidation of the sulfuric soils. This high pH killed plants and animals and make the area unusable by humans.Eventually the Tram Chim Nature Reserve was created as an attempt to restore this area to its former function and productivity. Initial restoration efforts focused on building dikes to keep the water from draining away. But eventually floodgates were constructed to allow the water to flow through the site, mimicking the flood and drying cycle of the original Plain of Reeds. In 1998, the area was converted to a National Park, giving it more legal protection.Management of both flood and fire regimes has continued and been improved upon. This site is now a place where native animals and plants have returned and the ecosystem functions more naturally. Exploitation by locals, nearby agriculture, and intrusion by invasive species continue to be threats to success of the wetland restoration at the Tram Chim National Park.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry This area had minor impacts due to rice farming and other agricultural activities over the last century. Farming and the building of canals may have aggravated the acidic sulfurous soils that are in the area, but scientists disagree about the extent of the damage.
During American-Vietnam war, the U.S. army rapidly drained the Plain of Reeds by digging canals (up to 70 meters wide and 6 meters deep). Once drained, the area dried out and could be burned to remove cover. The sulfur in the soil oxidized when it dried, releasing a flood of acidic materials once the rainy season came again. The soil pH dropped to 3.9 and below, affecting soil conditions and killing plants and fish.
After the war, the floodplain remained well-drained. Frequent wildfires erupted due to the dry conditions. Acidic water and soil prevented the use of this area by native plants, animals, humans, or agriculture. The wetland floodplain that exists in the Tram Chim National Park was dynamic system, subject to seasonal flooding. The plants and animals living here were adapted to the flood cycle and needed it to persist onsite. In the past, the wetlands contained scattered clumps of the tree Melaleuca cajiputi and possibly trees in the genus Eugenia. The area was also habitat for the rare eastern sarus crane (Grus antigone sharpii). One goal was to restore the Plain of Reeds ecosystem so that it could be habitat for the eastern sarus crane (Grus antigone sharpie) and other native animals. Another was to restore the ecosystem to its former level of productivity and biodiversity that it had prior to the American-Vietnam war.
These goals will primarily be met through restoring a semblance of natural hydrology to Tram Chim as well as controlling land-use in areas on and surrounding the Park.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: - Dams created to keep water from draining from area

 - Gates created to allow the water to ebb and flow with the natural cycle of the Mekong River

 - Native animals and plants allowed to recolonize at their own rate as conditions become favorable

 - Both water and fire cycles actively managed to reduce impacts of acidic soil and habitat loss

 - Monitoring of plants and animals on site has been ongoing 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: As of 2001, Habitats seem to be improving within the park due to the mimicking of natural hydrological regimes.  Managers continue to improve upon the implementation of this restored hydrology.  

During one survey 88 species of bird were recorded on the Tram Chim National Park including several species that are endangered, threatened, or nearly threatened globally:  Bengal florican, eastern sarus crane, grey-headed lapwing, Oriental darter and Asian golden weaver.  

The Tram Chim National park is also home to a vegetative community containing Eleocharis and wild rice Oryza which has mostly been lost on the rest of the area that was formerly the Plain of Reeds. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The main factor limiting recovery of this area is socio-economic.  The Tram Chim National Park is commonly used by marginal people as a place to hunt and gather food, although legally it is protected.  Additionally, it has been politically difficult to implement this restoration plan because this plan requires convincing local people that this area should be restored to its natural state rather than converted into a place to cultivate food or cash crops.  This has resulted in many delays in implementing the restoration plan.  This National Park has also caused hard feelings among many locals, resulting in many deliberate acts of vandalism and arson on the Park.  

The area surrounding Tram Chim has mostly been converted to rice paddies, which interferes with natural water flow and introduces pollutants.  

Additionally, invasive species such as the Mimosa pigra have become a problem on the Tram Chim National Park.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: This site allows a part of the original Plain of Reeds to function much as it once did, providing a refuge for many species of plants and animals.  

The Tram Chim National Park has seen an increasing number of eco-tourists in recent years.
This project has allowed a portion of the Plain of Reeds ecosystem to be saved, along with many of the plants and animals that depend upon it.
The managers at the Tram Chim National Park still face many difficulties (from pollution to invasive species to arson) and will have to find solutions if this ecosystem is to survive long-term. Managers will continue to find new ways to address the problem of recreating the natural hydrology of the area. Managers will also have to re-create the fire-regime in the area.
The Tram Chim National Park and its resources are protected by law, but enforcement will have to be increased to reduce poaching and other illegal human impacts.
Nearby local residents should be included in the process and educated about the reasons for restoring a sustainable Plain of Reeds ecosystem at the Park in order to acquire their goodwill. This may not occur until the underlying reasons for human encroachment (acute poverty and inability to make a living sustainably) are addressed. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-florida-mangrove-restoration-at-west-lake-broward-county/	USA: Florida: Mangrove Restoration at West Lake (Broward County)	United States of America	1986-05-30	1995-05-30	"Mangrove restoration has been attempted in many places around the world, but failures have been common and much money has been wasted. Hydrologic restoration–i.e. planning for restored hydrology and natural colonization of seedlings–appears to be the most cost effective form of mangrove restoration. This project employed that strategy and resulted in the successful establishment of 500 hectares of mangroves at West Lake in Broward County, Florida. In addition to facilitating the cost-effective development of viable mangrove habitat, the modified hydrologic design also included tidal creeks that allowed proper hydrology to support restored fish habitat.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The West Lake estuary and watershed is an urban/suburban estuary ecosystem with one of the largest ports in the USA (Port Everglades). Dredging and filling in support of this port have modified both the shallow edge and bottom of the estuary. Home development along the shore was proposed, and portions of the land purchased for US$20 million and converted to a county Park (total area 600 ha, 500 ha of mangrove and open water), domestic and industrial waste discharges, and habitat loss due to poor management have all contributed to the degradation of the estuary. The natural resources found within the park’s boundaries include approximately 123 different bird species(including 20 that are Rare, Threatened or Endangered in the state of Florida), 10 animal species, over 80 forms of plant life, and 86 species of fish including the snook (a species of special concern in the state of Florida). The restoration of 500 ha of mangrove forest through hydrologic improvements to blocked mangroves, and the removal of 80 ha of historical dredged material fill.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The local government is responsible for the planning, design, implementation, evaluation and oversight of this project.

Description of Project Activities: **Australian pine areas, growing on higher filled land, are selected for reforestation by mangroves.

**The pines are removed from the site. The now-cleared land is ready for heavy equipment earthwork.

**The land elevation is lowered to a height suitable for natural seed establishment of mangrove propagules. In West Lake, the desired elevation is from +0.9 to +1.4 feet above sea level. The earth removal stage is known as ""scrapedown.""

**Channels are constructed within the scrapedown sites to assist mangrove seed dispersal by tidal waters. Small fish begin to utilize the channels.

**Mangrove seeds of red, black and white mangrove begin floating in immediately to revegetate the site. Wading birds utilize the newly-created wetland to search for fish. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: 80 ha of persistent new mangrove forest have been added to the ecosystem, and an additional 420 ha of mangroves have received improved hydrology.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: While the County's major emphasis is on restoring and preserving the environmentally sensitive natural habitats of West Lake, the site ultimately will include minimal facilities aimed at providing public education and recreational amenities. Plans include the construction of the Anne Kolb Nature Center and outdoor classroom, multi-use boardwalks, fishing facilities, small boat launching site, public observation areas, and hiking trails.
Proper research into the existing hydrology prior to the design of the final restoration program resulted in a savings of US$15 million, since the first restoration program was estimated to cost US$20 million, but the final approved design did more for the ecosystem at less cost. The entire restoration site is publicly owned and managed as a Broward County park. Active removal of invasive exotic plants like Australian pine (Casuarina spp.) and Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) occurs to prevent loss of shoreline mangroves that these species compete with. Annual educational and training programs entitled “Mangrove Forest Ecology, Management and Restoration” are taught at the Anne Kolb Nature Center which is part of the facility. Park staff participate in the course to improve their skills at managing the ecosystem. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/united-kingdom-england-the-wetlands-restoration-project-at-the-woodland-education-centre-offwell-honiton-devon/	United Kingdom: England: The Wetlands Restoration Project at The Woodland Education Centre (Offwell, Honiton, Devon)	United Kingdom	1988-01-01	1991-12-31	"The Wetlands Restoration Project (UK) was started in order to restore water to an area that once was home to two Victorian boating lakes that had mostly filled with silt over the years. Instead of merely dredging up the silt, this project deliberately created four distinct types of habitat: lake, pond, marsh, and wetland. Devices to control the level of water were installed. Silt was removed. Non-native rhododendron was removed from the water areas. Native plants were planted in the hopes of attracting animal life. This restoration has been a success, leading to the colonization of many appropriate plants and animals. This site also functions as part of the Woodland Education Centre, provided educational and scientific opportunities.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The original vegetation and hydrology of this site was disturbed by the creation of two Victorian boating lakes. Over time, these lakes filled with silt, reducing the water area in the lakes to approximately one third of its original size. This filling in of the water areas created conditions that allowed the non-native rhododendron to completely take over the project area, creating poor habitat for native plants and animals. Native species were nearly absent from the project area pre-restoration. This area sustained numerous plant and wildlife species. The Wetlands Restoration project wanted to provide a more natural ecosystem to provide habitat for native plants and animals. Additionally this project will provide more natural history and educational opportunities for local students and scientists. By creating four distinct areas (lake, marsh, pond, wetland), the project managers have created a mosaic of different habitat and vegetation types and thus increased the biodiversity onsite.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
These wetlands were restored at The Woodland Education Centre, A Forestry Commission site.
The wetlands on this site were created and are managed by the Offwell Woodland & Wildlife Trust

Description of Project Activities: - The Southern Lake dam, which ad been breached by storm water, was repaired
 - A sluice was installed and structures put into place to control erosion
 - A spillway was constructed to control future damage from storm water
 - 17 workers cleared the enormous amounts of rhododendron onsite, while leaving native plants
 - Silt at the Southern Lake was removed to a depth of 300 mm to 2 m
 - Marsh area was planted with native plants
 - In marsh and wetland areas, contours were made to ensure that transitions between dray land to open water would be maintained
 - Botanical surveys were completed in 1991 for all four areas
 - Surveys were conducted in the wetland area in 2000 to determine the level of biodiversity on site
 - Removal of excess silt and rhododendron will continue as needed to maintain the site 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: - Control over water levels has been established
 - Appropriate plants (about 100 species) have colonized the lake, marsh, pond, and wetland areas bringing with them native animal species.
 - These areas provide educational opportunities for the Woodland Education Centre. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: This site will require maintenance in order to remain successful.  Excess silt must be removed to ensure that the rhododendron (which still occurs on the drier areas of the site) does not recolonize the restored area.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: This site is now home to many types of plants and animals.  Opportunities for natural education and wildlife viewing have been created.
This site is considered a success. Where a monoculture of sterile rhododendron once occurred, a series of more natural freshwater habitats now exist. This provided habitat to fish, invertebrates (including dragonflies), amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
This project was carefully planned to make sure that the restoration of one area did not affect the success of another area within the Wetlands Restoration Project. Most of the work was done during the winter to minimize impacts on plants and animals. The cause of degradation has been addressed by the creation of water-level control structures and the removal of silt and rhododendron. This site is being actively managed to prevent buildup of sediment in the ponds and encroachment by invasive species. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/india-mangrove-restoration-in-andhra-pradesh/	India: Mangrove Restoration in Andhra Pradesh	India	1997-05-29	2004-05-29	"This project was launched in Andhra Pradesh with the aim of inducing concerted action towards conservation and sustainable management of the mangrove wetlands on the east coast of India. The restoration employed canal techniques, instead of simple plantation of seedlings, and a fish bone pattern of canals was utilized. This fishbone design was shown to be a more efficient method of facilitating tidal flushing than the rectangular pattern used by the Forest Department. Thus, this technique has now been adapted and recommended by the Government of India for other restoration projects.Fisheries & Aquaculture, Mining & Resource Extraction, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry There are several factors contributing to the degradation of Andhra Pradesh’s mangrove forests. Until 1972, mangroves were clear felled in many parts of the region, and these areas have not been able to regenerate due to topographic changes. Not only that, the Krishna river is one of the heavily utilized rivers in peninsular India and is exploited for a variety of purposes. As a result, there has been a reduction in fresh water flow over a period of time, which has had a telling impact on the growth and regeneration of mangroves.
Another important contributor to ecosystem degradation is the rapid siltation and pollution of Kakinada Bay, as evidenced by a recent hydrographic study. With increased developmental activities and the establishment of fertilizer units, some effluents are being discharged into the bay. This has resulted in high amounts of ammonium and nitrate in bay waters, which may be contributing to degradation. Furthermore, the present depth of the bay is very low, and there is hardly any lateral mixing of waters. Therefore, there is a lot of stagnation in the bay which may also be affecting the mangroves.
A variety of anthropogenic activities has compounded these environmental conditions and has helped hasten the decline of the mangroves. Coastal villagers utilize mangroves for their basic needs such as firewood, fodder, fencing, house construction, thatching and fishing poles. Mangrove forests are also being converted into aquaculture ponds, salt pans and paddy fields with increasing frequency. To obtain greater commitment for the joint management of mangroves by the forest departments of these states in tandem with the local communities.
To enhance the capacity of the local communities to manage mangrove resources
To reduce the pressure on the mangroves by demonstrating viable economic alternatives

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
“Microplans” were prepared in the respective villages for the restoration of these degraded mangroves. Hydrologic and geomorphologic reasons for degradation were discussed with the communities in order to enhance their scientific awareness of mangrove restoration. The Mangrove Management Units (MMU), which include both degraded areas for restoration and the pristine mangroves for management, were identified for each Village Level Institution (VLI). The VLIs were trained in nursery raising and digging canals, and the restoration activity was carried out with the cooperation.

Description of Project Activities: A survey of the entire Godavari and Krishna mangroves was carried out in order to identify the degraded areas. Restoration began with the digging of canals to reduce salinity, facilitate tidal flushing, and drain stagnant water. A fishbone design was utilized in order to facilitate easy inflow and outflow of tidal water.  The main canals were dug at an angle of 45Âº to the natural creek, and the side canals were dug at an angle of 30 Âº to the main canal. The canals were dug in a trapezoidal shape in order to plant the saplings at the mid level of the canal. This is to ensure that the plants receive tidal water, but at the same time they are not submerged. The distance between side canals was 12.5 m during the first year of plantation; however, in subsequent years, this distance was reduced to 8 m in order to ensure a dense canopy.

After a buffer period of three months, nursery-raised mangrove saplings were planted along the trapezoid-shaped canals in the degraded areas. The planting was done in October and November, after the southwest monsoon, as the influx of rainwater during this period reduces the salinity of the soil. The eight-month-old saplings were planted along the slopes of the canals (20-25 cm from the top) with a gap of 2 m. The species Avicennia marina, Avicennia officinalis and Excoecaria agallocha were selected for planting, as these species tolerate a wide range of salinity. Aegiceras corniculatum, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Rhizophora apiculata, Rhizophora mucronata and Xylocarpus moluccensis were also planted in order to ensure genetic diversity. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: A total area of 520 ha of degraded mangroves was restored in the Godavari and Krishna mangroves. Initially the growth rate of new seedlings was slow, but after 2 to 3 years their growth rate had improved. 

The bio-diversity of the area has been positively impacted by the restoration. The crab population in the restored areas has increased due to the increased water regime. As biodiversity has improved and the denuded patches have been covered with mangroves, populations of larger animals like otters have also increased substantially. In addition to this, the bird population has shown an increase since the project began.

With the improvements made in hydrology, further degradation of mangroves has stopped. Mangroves are now naturally regenerating, and the canopy cover has become denser, as evidenced by remote sensing images taken recently. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: (None given)

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: As mentioned above, the newly established water regime has increased the population of edible crabs in the restored areas, and this is a benefit for the livelihood of local communities. There has also been good growth of fodder grass which has helped the local community in feeding their livestock.
Providing alternate employment and income generating activities to the villagers depending directly on mangroves has been an important aspect of this project. Micro-enterprises that use the local resources like dairying, rope making using coir fibers, fish vending, etc. have been found to have considerable employment potential. However, a major difficulty has been the non-availability of resource persons/institutions to identify and provide training in appropriate micro-enterprises in the local villages. An area of 9,442 ha is currently under the management of eight village level institutions. Moreover, NGOs (namely Sravanthi, Action in Godavari area, Sangamithra Service Society and Coastal Community Development Program in Krishna) were trained in restoration techniques and in participatory approaches for community mobilization and mangrove management. These NGO’s have since restored 215 ha of degraded mangroves. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/eritrea-the-manzanar-project-mangrove-afforestation-near-massawa/	Eritrea: The Manzanar Project — Mangrove Afforestation near Massawa	Eritrea	1988-01-01	1988-01-01	"The object of the Manzanar Mangrove Initiative is to create whole new forests of mangrove trees in vast areas of the world where mangrove trees do not grow at the present time. This will contribute to alleviating poverty in different parts of the world and to diminishing the threat of global warming. Poverty would be alleviated by creating a renewable resource – mangrove trees, which produce valuable timber–and by enriching the fish populations of adjacent seas. The mangrove forests would fix CO2 by photosynthesis and thus decrease the possibility of a catastrophic series of events – global warming by atmospheric CO2, melting of the polar ice caps, and inundation of the great coastal cities of the world. Eritrea was chosen as the site for the project demonstration for several reasons–most importantly, the indigenous population regularly faces famine due to the impossibility of developing an agrarian economy in a desert area.Fisheries & Aquaculture The coastal ecosystem of Eritrea is being altered by mangrove afforestation and the introduction of aquaculture technology as a means of improving the socio-economic circumstances of impoverished local communities. Eritrea has over 620 miles of coast, and most of it is gradually sloping beaches and shallow bays with thickets of mangroves forming a 100-meter fringe along the water’s edge. These mangrove stands comprise fifteen percent of the intertidal zone in Eritrea, and they are found in mersas, or creek mouths along the arid coastline where seasonal rains collect for just a few days of the year and flow into the sea. These mersas carry large amounts of sediment from inland areas and bring vital nutrients, namely nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron, that create ideal growing conditions for mangroves.
The Eritrean coast, with its shallow bays and mangrove clusters, is the perfect environment for fish farming. Here in the shallow water, fish, crabs, and shrimp live and breed thanks to the plankton, algae, and organisms that grow among the mangrove roots. Mullet, milkfish, sea bream, and red snapper all thrive here. Somewhat more than 500 yards offshore, thousands of acres of coral reef offer shelter to grouper, emperor, and many other species. Water quality in this area is without pollutants, and temperatures that range between 77 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the eight month fish maturation period are ideal for maximizing production.
The harbour town of Massawa, where the Manzanar project is based, is one of the driest places on Earth, with an annual rainfall of less than 20mm. This lack of precipitation, combined with temperatures up to 131 degrees Fahrenheit during the June through September period, facilitate the use and maintenance of aquaculture ponds, as they provide an opportunity for draining and drying the ponds in preparation for the next production cycle. To increase Eritrea’s per capita GDP tenfold to 1500 USD per year.
To alleviate poverty and help counter deforestation and global warming by creating whole new forests of mangrove trees in vast areas of the world where mangrove trees do not grow at the present time.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Eritrea, which won independence from Ethiopia in 1993, is one of the world’s poorest countries, with an annual per-capita income of only $A280. The lands which lie along its 1000km coastline are especially poor. Through the planting of mangroves, this project aims to create an economic base for coastal communities and improve their standard of living.

Description of Project Activities: The process is very simple. Artificial mangrove swamps are created by digging large areas to the depth of one foot below the average high tide level. Mangroves, which grow into five foot tall bushy shrubs in about six months, are planted using the fruit and propagules. After the trees are established, they drop leaves, which serve as food for nitrogen fixing bacteria, so that the forest can perpetuate itself. The decomposing leaves also provide nourishment for the large numbers of fish, shrimp and crab that seek shelter in the mangrove roots. 

Next to the mangrove swamps, deeper ponds are dug which are fertilized with a mixture of camel and goat dung. The algae that grow in this environment support mullet, a fish that is related to the algae-mud eating carp. These fish grow from the fingerling stage to one pound in four months, and then they are caught, cleaned, and shipped to the highlands. The viscera and heads are used to feed crab, shrimp and carnivorous fish that are cultured in other ponds or in cages anchored off shore.

The team is using the native African mangrove Avicennia marina, which provides excellent fodder for camels and goats. It is also planting out a second native mangrove species, Rhizophora mucronata, which had become almost extinct in the region because of its value as building timber. This species is also used for firewood - vital in a country where three-quarters of household energy comes from burning wood.

The basic assumption of the Manzanar project is that the vast deserts, readily available seawater, and abundant sunshine can be utilized to grow plants that can be irrigated with seawater to create wealth. That being said, we know that providing drainage for mangroves planted away from the sea will be our major concern. We also know that we will have to provide a slow-release fertilizer in order to successfully establish trees away from the nutrient-rich mersas. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: During the course of our work we planted mangroves around the periphery of ponds to stabilize banks and at sites well above sea level where the trees are irrigated with sea water. We noted that in almost all cases the trees grew as well as in their natural habitat. In fact, many of the mangrove trees are now well above head height, and the yellow-green coats of ripe propagules are beginning to split open, showing the plump green leaves within. The mangrove mud is sprouting pneumatophores, as if someone had sown a crop of pencils. Barnacles and oysters have started to settle on them, and crab and winkle trails crisscross the sediment.

In 2001, workers on the Manzanar project grew about 60,000 mangrove seedlings at various nurseries near Massawa, later successfully replanting them near the coast. The following year, the local Eritrean community planted another 250,000 mangroves, mostly at the village of Hargigo, 10km south of Massawa. In 2004 the total plantings at Manzanar exceeded 600,000 trees. It is estimated that the Manzanar Project has planted nearly one million mangrove trees on the coast of Eritrea since the project began.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The Manzanar project has now grown enough mangroves on the coast near Massawa to feed 2000 people with the animals the trees support. The project has planted about 600,000 mangrove trees in the vicinity of the village of Hargigo alone, and families in the village are raising sheep and goats on a diet of exclusively mangrove material. As a bonus, a great many crabs, shrimps and baby fish are now appearing in the mangrove plantation, helping to restore the local fishery. Sato believes that the mangrove forests will eliminate hunger and poverty in the village of Hargigo.
The main objective of the Manzanar project is to train people who have the confidence to think independently and try new things to build their country. It is important that they have a hands-on working knowledge of the project. Cleanliness will also be emphasized in the Manzanar project. Cleanliness means that people pay attention to the details of work and do it well. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-florida-comprehensive-everglades-restoration-plan/	USA: Florida: Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan	United States of America	2000-12-11	2000-12-11	"The Everglades was an immense ecosystem that once covered about 3,000,000 acres in Florida. Originally, the hydrology of the area was such that a shallow sheet of water flowed through sawgrass and nourished wetlands. In 1948, the government began to drain the wet areas, erected levies, and dug canals in order to clear room for agriculture and cities. This alteration controlled flooding and created land usable by humans but unfortunately had a number of negative side effects including: destruction of over 50% of the original Everglades, increase freshwater runoff into the ocean, and decreased water quality.In 2000, Congress approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) that provides funding for alterations to existing structures and addition of new structures (reservoirs, channels, etc.) that attempt to re-create the effect of the original water flow. This restoration will positively impact the Everglades and oceanic ecosystems as well as providing benefits to people.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry An astonishing 50% of the original Everglades are already destroyed due to changes in the hydrologic regime and urbanization.
In 1948, Congress initiated the Central & Southern Florida Project (C&SF Project). This project allowed the U.S Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District to construct a complicated water management system that drained, levied, and altered the wetlands to prevent flooding and provide irrigation for crops. This project allowed humans to come into Florida in large numbers both for agriculture and to build cities.
But this altered flow and timing of water dried up many of the Everglades wetlands entirely, which resulted in habitat loss and reduced water quality. This alteration also resulted in tremendous loss of freshwater into the ocean (about 1.7 billion gallons), which has hurt the ecosystems and inhabitants of both land and ocean. The Everglades was a huge area, home to countless species of birds, wildlife, fish, and plants. The Everglades also provides a stopover point for migratory birds.
Originally, the Everglades hydrology consisted of a giant, mostly uninterrupted sheetflow of freshwater that nourished the wetlands and provided a vast ecosystem. This water flowed seasonally and created the cycle to which the native plants and animals were adapted. This water soaked into the ground and the wetlands acted as natural filters, cleansing the water. This sheetflow protected against saltwater intrusions at the coast and the loss of freshwater into the ocean. The excess nutrients and contaminants flowing into the ocean are causing massive kills of fish and extirpation of oceanic species in the waters near Florida. The goal of the CERP is create infrastructure (of reservoirs and canals) that will allow the storage of freshwater and the redistribution of that freshwater to meet the needs of both the environment and people. The Everglades can not be exactly as it once was, but this project, when completed, will allow the persistence of a more natural system by mimicking original water flows. These projects may be able to restore the Everglades ecosystem. The CERP hopes to accomplish:
– An increase the water-filtering abilities of the wetlands, leading to better water quality
– A decrease the flow of water and contaminants into the ocean
– Sustainable water for both wetlands and people

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
This project is a partnership of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the South Florida Water Management District, and many other federal, state, local and tribal partners.

Description of Project Activities: - Water Resources Development Act of 2000 passed authorizing $1.4 billion for an initial set of projects (4 pilot programs, 10 project features, and programmatic authority to more quickly implement smaller projects)
 - Kissimmee River project nears completion
 - Water flow improvement an Everglades National Park nears completion
 - Several water treatment marshes were built to improve water quality
 - 207,000 acres of land has been purchased and more continues to be purchased
 - Pilot project and a regional study have been implemented
 - 19 projects are in planning stages
 - 2 projects""”Indian River Lagoon South and Southern Golden Gat Estates""”have completed planning and will move to design and construction phases
 - Management processes and agreements have been established
 - More than 50 projects have been prioritized into 5 year time frames, allowing implementation to be cost-effective and generate most good for the environment
 - Public meetings and workshops have been held and more are planned for the future
 - Projects are monitored to allow scientists and engineers to make improvements that will benefit future projects. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Recovery is expected to happen gradually as projects that restore more natural flow to the area are completed. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Structurally, the new system will not be identical to the original ecosystem of the Everglades.  Too much degradation and urbanization has already happened.  However, when fully implemented, the CERP may be able to preserve what remains of the Everglades using a modified water flow.  
This plan relies on Congress to authorize and fund new projects every two years which means that people must continue to support the CERP if it is to accomplish what it set out to do.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: - The CERP will help reduce the degradation of the Everglades, which is a unique ecosystem home to many species of plant and animal
 - Individual projects will reduce flooding of urban and agricultural areas & reduce water shortages
 - Water quality will improve
 - Less runoff will be going into the ocean, which may help local fisheries
So far several projects are proceeding according to plan. In fact, the Kissimmee project is on target for being completed almost two years early. The CERP is still in its infancy. The CERP is a very flexible plan that allows changes in design as new information becomes available from scientists. "

The project involved both a program of interventions and a process of capacitating communities to undertake their own development and assume responsibility for the conservation of their own productive resources. Community-based coastal resource management recognizes that the coastal residents are the real day-to-day managers of their day-to-day resources. They are the ones who decide each day whether to exploit their productive resources mindlessly or to manage them for long-term, sustained yields. Thus, this project focused on involving community members in every step of the process and helping them organize themselves to rehabilitate local ecosystems and effectively manage their resources into the future.Fisheries & Aquaculture, Mining & Resource Extraction The introduction of fishpond technology, the arrival of commercial fishers and the entry of commercial mangrove cutters from neighboring provinces have all been major factors in the degradation of mangroves and marine ecosystems in Cogtong Bay. Fishermen from local communities reported the decline of their average catch from about 20 kilos in the 1960s, to 10 kilos in the 1970s, to approximately 5-7 kilos in the 1980s. The coastal shelves around the islands of the Central Visayas region account for just 12% of the marine waters but support almost all marine fishery activities. The productivity of these waters depends on the condition of adjacent coral reefs, mangroves and estuaries. Mud crabs (alimango) and mangrove clams (imbao) are important mangrove fisheries, while shrimp and prawns are commonly caught in the rivers. Rabbit fish (danggit), mullet, blue crabs, sea cucumber and sea weed (gracilaria) are taken from the sea grass beds, and small pelagic fishes including sardines and mackerel dominate the offshore catch. – To rehabilitate 360 hectares of mangrove under a community-planned approach that provides 480 families with Certificate of Stewardship Contracts (CSCs). These contracts are intended to establish a land tenure system that recognizes the holder’s right to use the land but also their responsibility to ensure its protection.
– To install approximately 240 artificial reef clusters in coastal waters adjacent to areas with mangrove rehabilitation in order to increase the fish population.
– To give the communities center stage in the planning and implementation process in order to invest them in long-term sustainable development and help them assume the responsibilities of resource management.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The project generated the participation of some 405 legitimate participants/beneficiaries. These participants were marginal fishers, shell gatherers, nipa shingle makers and mangrove firewood cutters who depended, all or in part, on the resources of the bay.

Description of Project Activities: Reforestation activities included areas at the outer edge of existing mangrove stands extending 50 to 100 meters seaward, and also some areas illegally cleared for fishpond development. The primary reforestation species is Rhizophora spp, but Xylocarpus Granatum and Avicennia spp. were also considered. 

Replanting was organized through the system of Certificate of Stewardship Contracts (CSCs), whereby certificate holders were placed in charge of the rehabilitation effort. Areas technically suited for mangrove reforestation and subsequent management were first identified for project clients. Before planting activities actually commenced, each applicant for a stewardship contract would develop a plan that outlined the areas for new and enrichment planting, the species to be used and proposed maintenance procedures. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: A post-project mangrove assessment in July 1997 indicates a relatively good mangrove growth at the reforested areas, particularly at Katungkian, which seems to have been influenced by protection from waves, relatively shallow depth, extensive water run-offs, and a muddy soil layer. The total basal area of mangrove stands was highest in Katungkian at 6.82 m2ha-1.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: From the perspective of fishermen, positive socioeconomic changes occurred in a number of indicators, given a comparison of the situation before the project (1988) and after the project (1997) (Pomeroy et al. 1996). Larger positive changes were perceived in knowledge of mangroves, information exchange on both mangrove management and fisheries management, control over mangrove resources, quickness of resolving community conflicts, and influence over community affairs. They also perceived an improvement in household income and household well-being, among others.

In recent years, the Village and Municipal Councils of Candijay and Mabini have demonstrated a stronger interest in coastal resource management. They have supported the establishment of a new fish sanctuary at Lumislis Island, pushed for stricter local legislation, and recognized communal mangrove areas for firewood gatherers.
The shift from open access to a communal property rights regime for mangrove areas in Cogtong Bay was prompted by several factors. These include: 1) a common dependence on coastal resources on the part of resource users; 2) desire for better coastal resource management on the part of government organizations and non-government organizations; 3) concern for improving the socioeconomic condition of poor coastal residents; 4) legitimacy of property rights; and, 5) realization of the need for collective action against illegal fishing and illegal mangrove cutting to avert further resource degradation.
Many participants were initially hesitant to cooperate as a result of conflicting government policies and the disinclination of some local government officials to strict law enforcement. These issues were eventually resolved when project leaders, together with fishermen’s associations, pressured appropriate organizations to take action. However, this conflict draws attention to the difficulty of managing coastal resources without the sustained cooperation of the government and the resource users in order to make rules and regulations work (particularly for fisheries management).
It appears that the co-management regime initiated by this project has been more successful in mangrove management than fisheries management. This is due, in part, to the issuance of stewardship contracts that provided a strong incentive to protect the mangrove stands, but the relative ease of patrolling the mangrove areas is also a factor. Nurturing the resource base and protecting livelihoods over the longer term called for a shift from a ‘use orientation’ to a ‘resource management orientation’ that actively seeks the enhancement of knowledge, skills, responsibility and accountability of resource users and other stakeholders. Central to this perspective is the recognition that resource users are de facto managers of the natural resource base and stewards of the environment in which they live. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/ecuador-mangrove-restoration-in-muisne/	Ecuador: Mangrove Restoration in Muisne	Ecuador	2003-05-24	2004-06-24	"This project of the Fundación de Defensa Ecológica (Ecological Protection Foundation – FUNDECOL) of Ecuador aimed to restore the mangroves of the Musine district in the Esmeraldas province of Ecuador. The project benefited the communities of traditional users who use the mangroves every day for the fish, mollusks, crustaceans, and timber that comprise the primary source of income and food for their families.Indiscriminate cutting of trees in the mangroves, caused by the uncontrolled incursion of the shrimp industry in the Musine district, has resulted in the loss of vast areas of mangroves and created negative repercussions for other species that inhabit the ecosystem. Community efforts to protect the mangroves and active participation in reforestation, monitoring the conservation status of the ecosystem, and protection of the estuary has helped to restore the traditional link between people and mangroves and reaffirm their identity. The community took the initiative to participate in training sessions and reforestation, legislation, and community and environmental law workshops, and played a key role in the development and conservation of their own natural resources.Fisheries & Aquaculture It is estimated that by 1999, the estuary of the Muisne River had lost some 90% of its original mangrove forest. The primary cause of this deforestation is the uncontrolled incursion of the shrimp industry into the region. This destruction of the mangrove forest has resulted in a loss of plant and animal species, frequent floods of residential and agricultural areas, and critical levels of poverty in the surrounding communities. The mangrove estuary of Muisne River, in the Muisne district of southern Esmeraldas province, had an original extension of 20,098 hectares of mangroves, according to Ministerial Agreement Number 238 of the Ministry of Agriculture published in July of 1987. – Reincorporate 32 acres (13 hectares) of abandoned shrimp ponds and degraded areas into the mangrove ecosystem, and reincorporate them into the ecosystem’s dynamics.
– Promote the sustainable management of mangroves among the local population by providing them with reforestation tools, and by the constant monitoring of the ecosystem’s conservation status.
– Provide training in legal matters related to the conservation of the mangrove ecosystem and citizen’s rights.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Fundación de Defensa Ecológica (FUNDECOL) has been working for 14 years to defend, protect and restore the plants and animals of the mangrove ecosystem for the benefit of local user communities.
For the duration of this particular project, and especially during the first few months, meetings were held with various groups from the local communities–“Real Fortuna” from the town of Bilsa, “El Progreso” from the La Florida neighborhood, “Bellavista” from the Bellavista neighborhood, and “Mangrove Defense” from Daule, to offer a few examples. These meetings reaffirmed the need to restore the deforested areas, especially the abandoned shrimp ponds, as quickly as possible and reincorporate them into the local economy.

Description of Project Activities: Once the areas for reforestation were established, the collection of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) and black mangrove (Avicennia Germinans) seeds began. By means of visits to the different estuaries, healthy propagules were collected, and then the healthiest were selected for later plantation in the nurseries.

Approximately 29,000 red and black mangrove seeds were collected in total, of which 27,500 were ultimately used in the replanting effort. The propagules were planted on 6.25 mÂ² and 4 mÂ² plots in ten distinct phases, with a total of 13.28 hectares of reforestation. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: To date, the project has achieved a survival rate of 90% for the seedlings in the recovery areas. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: There is a need for funding to further the restoration effort, especially funds to cover the cost of fuel.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The participation of the mangrove's traditional users is growing, and they are beginning to make the decisions about the restoration, management, and use of the mangroves.
A team of ecosystem monitors was established from among members of the mangrove user group, and the hope is that they will come to understand the dynamics of the mangrove ecosystem. Toward this end, 20% of the replanted area was divided into five equal plots, and data about adaptability and growth, average survival rate, average growth per plantation, and average size of the plants was collected from these areas.
Furthermore, talks on constitutional law and legal provisions for the protection of the mangrove ecosystem have been implemented in local communities as part of this project. The mangrove users need to learn about their rights and about how to use the legal system to report any irregularities or violations in the newly created conservation policies.
Ultimately, the practitioners would like to have the 32 acres of mangrove that are under reforestation become part of an adjacent 9-acre wildlife reserve. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-idaho-west-page-swamp-wetland-restoration-project-bunker-hill/	USA: Idaho: West Page Swamp Wetland Restoration Project (Bunker Hill)	United States of America	1997-06-01	2000-09-30	"The West Page Swamp wetland restoration project lies within the Bunker Hill, Idaho superfund site. This individual restoration project was set up as a research site to evaluate the use of a cap of biosolids (including compost, wood ash, and wood waste) over soils contaminated by heavy metals as a result of mining. It appears that these methods are useful. These new soils limit the bioavailability of lead to plants and animals and also provide nutrients for plant growth. This site was being monitored as of 2005 and will probably continue to be monitored. If this method of remediation is successful, it may be used in further restorations both in the Bunker Hill (Idaho) superfund site and elsewhere.Mining & Resource Extraction Starting in 1916 and into the 1980s, the Bunker Hill site was used for the mining and smelting of lead (Pb) and Zinc (Zn). The West Page Swamp site was used for direct tailings deposition between 1918 and 1929. This resulted in contamination from Lead, Zinc, Cadmium (Cd), and Arsenic (As). Mine tailings reached depths of 18 inches to 10 feet, vegetation was sparse, and the soil was found to be contaminated with very high metal concentrations (lead was found at about 30,000 mg/kg; zinc at concentrations of about 15,000 mg/kg; and cadmium at concentrations of roughly 100 mg/kg).
Because of the mining activity, the soil on site lacked vegetation due to the poor physical properties of the soil, acidity, salts, and metal toxicity. Additionally, this ecosystem had an elevated lead level, endangering any waterfowl that may use these wetlands for feeding or nesting. Unknown. The goals of the West Page Swamp wetland restoration project were:
– Test the effectiveness of using compost and organic residuals to remediate lead-contaminated sediment so that these techniques and components could be used on similar sites.
– Establish a place where native vegetation could grow and thrive
– Reduce the bioavailability of lead and other contaminants to animal species
If these goals are attained, then the site will have better ecosystem function and not pose a hazard to life currently or in the future.

Description of Project Activities: - This site was set up as a research site, to determine the usefulness of this type of remediation as a solution to contaminated soils in wetlands
 - Tailings in the area were removed to a depth of 0.7 meters
 - About 15 cm of compost and wood ash were spread over the site using heavy equipment
 - Significant problems arose with rising groundwater and poor accessibility so that they constructed a road for heavy equipment and used a blower to spread the new soil
 - But in September of 2000, the remaining area were covered by the new soil
 - The outlet end of the wetland was closed to make sure a water depth of 2 feet was maintained.
 - The movement and settling of the treatment was monitored at 12 and 24 months
 - The effluent quality (suspended solids, pH, species, and water quality) was monitored monthly
 - Plant establishment and their uptake of metals was monitored
 - Carbon and Nitrogen dynamics were monitored at 6, 12, and 24 months
 - A greenhouse study was implemented to determine differences between treated and untreated soil including: bioaccessibility of sediment lead, plant growth, and metal uptake.
 - Monitoring for metal bioavailability continued at least until 2005 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: This appears to be an effective method of remediating lead contaminated soils.  Plants grown in the treatment area (with added soil) had less lead mg/kg than plants grown in the control areas (without added soil). Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Using biosolids is a good decision economically.  This method is cheaper than other methods such as capping with non-biological substances or removing the soil.  Biosolids are also easily obtainable because they are just recycled by-products of other human activities.  

Future monitoring will be needed at this site to ensure this method is a permanent solution since the contaminants are still on site.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Remediation of this site minimizes the amount of lead and other contaminants that could enter the human food supply through consumption of waterfowl that have used this site.

This research site also provided scientific evidence on the efficacy of this treatment.
Application of simple, recycled, natural materials including wood ash, compost, and wood waste seems to have provided the nutrients to encourage vegetative cover and reduced the bioavailability of lead to plants and waterfowl.
This site will continue to be monitored and the lessons learned will probably be implemented at larger sites. Mining, the major reason for the degradation of this site, is not longer practiced in this area. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/thailand-participation-of-local-communities-in-mangrove-forest-rehabilitation-pattani-bay/	Thailand: Participation of Local Communities in Mangrove Forest Rehabilitation (Pattani Bay)	Thailand	1996-06-24	1999-10-24	"By working together with local communities in three villages around Pattani Bay, Thailand, this project aimed to restore severely degraded sites of former mangroves. The project followed an approach of combined environmental rehabilitation and socio-economic improvements, placing greater emphasis on the process than on outputs, and facilitating initiatives of the community, rather than ideas of the project team. Local ownership of the project and effective community participation were considered crucial to achieve sustainable impacts.The project focused its main activities on strengthening community organisation, building environmental awareness ,mangrove rehabilitation through hydrological restoration and replanting of seedlings, support to alternative livelihood initiatives, and information dissemination. Although far from completely successful, the project has been able to support several income-generating activities of the communities, has successfully enhanced their environmental awareness, and has received their cooperation in the replanting of a community mangrove forest for which a community-based management plan has been prepared.Fisheries & Aquaculture, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Threats to the coastal wetlands of Pattani Bay are characteristic of most of Thailand’s coastal areas, and include: reclamation for intensive shrimp aquaculture (and related conversion and pollution), major port developments (and related dredging), industrial expansion (and pollution),and destructive fishing by commercial trawling and by boats equipped with pushnets (Ruttanadakul et al.,1993). The primary goal of this initiative was to sustain and restore the mangrove forest resources in Southern Thailand through the development of community-based resource use management practices and improved cross-sectoral coordination of development planning.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
From the start, the project involved community members, local environmental NGOs and local government offices in the planning, implementation and review of the project, thereby creating a strong sense of local ownership.
Both the management and the field team made special effort to listen to the comments, criticisms, and suggestions from individual community members, local environmental NGOs, grassroots organisations, and other institutions involved. By taking a flexible approach, the project allowed for changes in objectives, approaches and activities at any stage during the implementation. This was particularly important, as the involvement of local stakeholders in the early stages of needs assessment and project design had been far from adequate.
As part of this project, the project team arranged meetings for the villagers with the Prime Minister, Pattani Governor, Royal Forest Department and Harbour Department officials to discuss environmental threats facing Pattani Bay and its fishing grounds. Moreover, detailed information about this project has been widely and frequently disseminated using various media, as an integral part of the project activity framework.

Description of Project Activities: A range of initiatives was employed with the intention to organise the local communities in the three target villages for common environmental action. These started with loose gatherings, and informal meetings and discussions in the villages, largely building on existing friendships with individual villagers, which had been established previously in the scope of earlier projects by the university.

The team further strengthened the commitment and self-confidence of interested community members from the three target villages by facilitating their participation in peaceful demonstrations in Bangkok of the Forum of the Poor,and in public hearings, seminars and workshops on local and national environmental issues. The team also arranged meetings for the villagers with the Prime Minister, Pattani Governor, Royal Forest Department and Harbour Department officials to discuss environmental threats facing Pattani Bay and its fishing grounds. In addition, the project organised a one-week study tour (attended by 21 villagers) visiting various good and bad examples of community-based coastal resource management in Malaysia and Singapore.

With the guidance of the project team, villagers replanted mangroves at two of the three villages, with mixed results, and at Bang Tawa, the villagers also replanted several hundred Casuarina equisetifolium trees on a nearby sandbar, along with indigenous plants and fruit trees in small gardens near their houses. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Substantial achievements in mangrove rehabilitation were made in one of the three target villages, Bang Tawa. At this village, an area of approximately 80 ha of severely degraded mangroves, completely clear-felled in most of the area, was available for the community. Initial trials of experimental replanting by the villagers in collaboration with university staff and field workers of an area of approximately 5 ha were largely unsuccessful, with survival rates of the seedlings below 20%.

After addressing hydrology and grazing issues, a total of nearly 30 ha have been planted with seedlings of several mangrove tree species at this community forest site. The survival and growth of the replanted mangrove seedlings improved greatly, the best results being achieved with Avicennia marina (the species most tolerant to high salinity). Despite the construction of a channel to improve tidal flooding and a windmill to keep the plot inundated during the dry season, most of the mangrove species other than Avicennia showed relatively low rates of growth and survival.

Some initial trial mangrove replanting of approximately 5 ha was done at Tanjong Lulo in early 1996,but abandoned due to poor success and lack of community support. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Drought and grazing by goats and sheep were identified by the villagers as the primary causes of the initial failure at Bang Tawa.

Soil salinity also played a role in the low survival rate at Bang Tawa, as Avicennia marina was the only species able to tolerate the growing conditions. With the advice of an outside mangrove restoration expert, small-scale hydrological improvements were made to the channel and topography of the replanting site. These micro-scale corrections resulted in an improved drainage connection, allowing for increased tidal flushing by seawater, and proper drainage and run-off of rainwater to rinse out the excessive amounts of salt, which had accumulated in the soil after years of seawater evaporation at the site. These improvements are expected to reduce the soil salinity over time, and gradually lead to improved survival and growth of mangrove species other than the high-salinity tolerant Avicennia marina.

Community participation in mangrove rehabilitation and management has been less successful in the two other villages, because the communities in these villages, plagued by a complex web of local political conflicts, have not yet reached the stage in which they were ready for environmental action and community-based resource management.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Realizing the discrepancy between the outsiders' long-term interest in wetland rehabilitation and the immediate development priorities of the local communities in the target villages, the project extended its support to more general aspects of community development in addition to its environmental rehabilitation objectives.

By improving existing livelihood activities and supporting alternative livelihood initiatives that promoted the community's self-reliance and quality of life, the project placed the emphasis on local benefits for the community. Existing livelihood activities were improved by value-adding processes, and by improving marketing strategies of products and commodities, by eliminating unnecessary middlemen, and expanding the markets to include other towns and cities. A special village development fund was set up with assistance of the project to establish a sustainable source of funding for alternative livelihood activities through profit-sharing, and to provide incentives for the initiation of collective community development initiatives. These efforts have offered villagers an opportunity for increased self-reliance, and at the same time, they have served to raise the interest of the communities in the restoration project.
The initial approach by the field team of working directly with the villagers clearly underestimated the powers and pivotal role of the existing local administrative structures and government-appointed leaders. A lack of involvement and understanding among the local administrators resulted in a lack of institutional support and poor sustainability of the project’s efforts.
Although friendships with selected individual villagers established during earlier projects certainly helped to get the process of village organisation started, this did not necessarily include the key persons of the village. Failure by the largely Buddhist project team to build an understanding and win the support among key Muslim religious leaders and scholars also contributed to the limited progress in community organisation. In addition, opportunities for fruitful cooperation and networking with existing grassroots organisations in the region (e.g. the Southern Thailand Small-scale Fishermen Federation) were missed, largely as a result of personality conflicts.
In establishing effective participation, therefore, it is not necessary to choose sides with the influential and most powerful persons in the village, but it is crucial to make an effort to ensure they are always informed and aware of why and what the project is doing to gain their understanding, and as such, their indirect support.
The project has placed perhaps too great an emphasis on the local community (in awareness building, education, participation and management), resulting in a lack of understanding, involvement and commitment from other stakeholders, such as the regional government institutions and the local administration.
One of the key lessons to date is the importance of facilitation, rather than implementation, for the role of the project team. Rather, effective community participation in environmental and socio-economic rehabilitation and management is a long-term process that can only be achieved through large-scale programmes with an incremental approach. In order to catalyse the community’s interest in the long-term sustainability objectives of the rehabilitation and wise use of the coastal wetland in the wider study area, a large number of environmental awareness and educational activities were developed to run parallel to the other project activities right from the beginning.
In addition to these specific awareness-raising activities, the project has been implementing a strong information dissemination component. Regular project newsletters in Thai language (11 issues to date,up to 5000 copies), local press releases, three TV documentaries, and daily radio broadcasts (400 issues to date, reaching out through network stations to 17 Thai provinces) have featured reports on progress and specific information regarding project activities, stories on local resource use in the target villages, feed-back comments by the villagers on the project, educational information on mangroves, and regional environmental news and events.
Throughout the project, local ownership and involvement was encouraged as a way of investing people in project goals and creating a foundation for future, community-based initiative in mangrove management, conservation and restoration. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-florida-matheson-hammock-tidal-creek-restoration-biscayne-bay/	USA: Florida: Matheson Hammock Tidal Creek Restoration (Biscayne Bay)	United States of America	2001-10-24	2001-10-24	"This project aims to clear dead trees and debris deposited by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 from mangrove tidal passageways in Matheson Hammock Park on Biscayne Bay. Once tidal flow is restored, the mangrove forest will serve again as a vital nursery and foraging ground for young fish and many species of invertebrates. In an effort to prevent further damage to this sensitive habitat, the debris will be removed by volunteers using canoes and manual labor instead of large machinery. Replanting of red mangroves and endangered sea grasses is another of the project’s intended activities, but the first priority is clearing the blocked channels and restoring hydrologic processes.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry Pressure from urbanization, loss of natural water flow, and pollution were just some of the critical problems already faced by this habitat, when in August 1992 Hurricane Andrew struck its shores with full force, flattening the entire mangrove forest and choking all tidal creeks with fallen trees and other storm debris. The cleansing effects of natural tidal flow became restricted to the point of stagnation in most areas. Prior to Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the mangrove wetlands contained within the park served as high-volume feeding, breeding, and spawning habitat for anadromous fish, baitfish, and marine reptiles (i.e. sea turtles). The park’s tidal creeks were also one of the nation’s largest migration habitats of horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). Wading birds use this habitat to roost, and migratory birds use it as a stopover. Manatees find this area comfortable in storm weather and summer retreat, and saltwater crocodiles have also been spotted in the mangrove-lined tidal creeks. Wildlife Research Team’s five-year goal for Matheson Hammock’s mangrove ecosystem is to unclog the tidal creeks and remove debris from cross corridors, thereby restoring this unique and historic Preserve back to a balanced and healthy estuarine habitat that will nurture countless fish, invertebrates, birds, mammals, and endangered creatures seeking safe harbor such as sea turtles, manatees, and even saltwater crocodiles.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Matheson Hammock Park, on the northern boundary of the Preserve, is enjoyed by thousands of people every year for swimming, wading, fishing, kayaking, canoeing, sunbathing, jogging, bicycling, birdwatching, and just enjoying nature.

Description of Project Activities: In most places, this habitat is impregnable to powered craft due to shallow water, twisted broken flora, deposits of trash, and accumulated debris from Hurricane Andrew and subsequent storms. High tides enable passage over some submerged debris, but trees fallen over the waterways easily entangle explorers. Therefore, WRT volunteers must rely on canoes for the restoration effort. Canoes have been found advantageous, though, as they afford a non-polluting, unobtrusive means of approaching clogged channels and evaluating the condition of the ecosystem without causing further damage.

WRT volunteers use their canoes to carefully remove dead and decaying flora from the channels. This removal includes remains of large red and black mangrove trees, found both above and below the surface of the water, as well as invasive species such as Australian pine. While some areas can be reached and cleared during low tide, others can only be accessed during high tide. Whichever the case, when tidal conditions permit entry into the site, each obstruction is evaluated and then removed by hand. The channels are first cleared of debris and then, log by log, the accumulated debris along the edges of the corridor is paddled out to a pickup area. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: By March 2002, one corridor from east to west had been completely cleared of debris, thus restoring tidal flow. Since tidal flow has been restored, black mullet, fantail mullet, and a variety of snapper have been observed in the corridor. On March 3, 2002, a saltwater crocodile was also observed feeding in the same area.

By December 2002, a separate loop corridor and several smaller corridors had also been cleared for a total of 3.9 miles of fish corridors. 

As of April 2003, a total of approximately 27.5 acres had been restored. In all of these cleared channels, there has been an improvement in water quality and clarity, increased tidal flush, and enhanced foliage growth. There are also significant numbers of fish where there was once only stagnation.
The canoe is uniquely suited to restoration projects as this vessel causes no pollution, and no damage to low water flora or fish. Fieldwork by Wildlife Research Team has proven that canoes are noiseless and are a superb base of noninvasive operations, observations, and monitoring. Canoes can be used for every task–a fulcrum to break free submerged obstructions, a workbase, a floating dock, a trash hauler. "

Our work will enhance national and regional capacity and skills relevant to future mangrove restoration efforts.Deforestation, Fisheries & Aquaculture The mangrove forests of Gazi Bay are heavily used by local people as a fishing ground and a source of wood for building and fuel. Therefore, mangrove deforestation is widespread, with much of the forests cut down or otherwise degraded. This has left the shores of the bay muddy and vulnerable to erosion. – To replant the mangroves and test how the diversity of mangrove species in replanted stands affects a range of ecosystem functions.
– To use controlled experiments to test the effects of replanted mangroves on
sediment dynamics (in both low and high energy areas), and to measure how
these effects change as the trees mature.
– To assess the effectiveness of mangroves in mitigating coastal erosion
– To collect data of direct relevance to practical restoration projects (such as the role of intercropping in enhancing productivity, and reducing disease), thus helping to inform future restoration efforts.
– To measure the capacity of planted mangrove woods to sequester carbon dioxide, and thus help to mitigate climate change, and to explore whether this
ecosystem function varies depending on the mix of species present.
– To work with local people in establishing replanted mangrove plots, which will form part of a sustainably managed local resource.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
On a local level, villagers rely heavily on mangroves for a range of goods and services. Thus, the outcome of this project is of critical importance to their livelihood and economic vitality.
On a national level, Kenya is a country suffering from a severe shortage of woodlands, and mangroves are often the major woodland resource along the coast. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop better mangrove management plans, and this project will provide insight into effective planning.
The conservation and rehabilitation of mangroves are global priorities and therefore, the international community should also be considered a stakeholder. Not only will this project contribute important information on how mangroves can be restored, it will also shed light on the role of mangroves in stabilizing coastlines and absorbing carbon dioxide. Both of these functions are highly significant in the face of global climate change.

Description of Project Activities: During their first field season, Huxham and his team planted 6,077 mangrove trees in 46 experimental plots. Four different species of trees were planted: Sonneratia alba, Ceriops tagal, Avicennia marina, and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza. Planted in two separate areas where mangroves once grew, Area 1 will be used to test the different ecosystems that are created within the different mix of tree species, while Area 2 will be used to test the effects of mangroves on sedimentation and erosion.

Within area 1, the trees were planted in groups of varying combinations of one to four of the different species. This method of varying the species planted near each other will test the success of intercropping in mangroves, and will determine whether or not the mixing of two or more species of trees can make the forest more productive.

Over the next five years, both replanted areas of mangroves will be closely monitored and tested. In Area 1, scientists will focus on what is in the sediment to seehow tree species diversity affects sediment quality. Area 1 will also be tested for crab diversity and abundance using binocular and burrow counting methods at ten randomly chosen points.

Area 2 will be monitored for tree survival and recruitment, or the presence and density of trees that have grown up naturally within the area.

To monitor erosion in both areas, six erosion stations have been established at random locations in each experimental plot. These consist of two 2 meters long, 5 centimeter diameter stakes, buried to 1 meter depth 1.5 meter apart. Sediment height at the midpoint between these stakes will be recorded by measuring down from a horizontal cross bar. During each field season, researchers will measure the height of the sediment to see how much erosion has taken place. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Many of the trees survived the critical first two months of establishing themselves. With an overall mortality rate of 5.2 percent, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza has shown the greatest mortality so far, while Sonneratia alba has shown the least. The success of the latter species may be due to the different site we used for planting.

Our crab measurements have shown increased biomass in planted areas, with a trend in the data towards increased biomass in plots with more species of trees.

Only one species of fish, the mangrove goby, was found in our new plantations during the initial assessment. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Our main beach site plots suffered grazing from goats.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Already, the women of Gazi, with support from the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, have established an ecotourism venture that profits from the value of the mangrove's scenic beauty and biodiversity.

On a broader level, though, the local people at Gazi are heavily dependent on the mangroves for direct economic uses, such as firewood and building poles (Kairo 2001), as well as for ecological services, such as nursery provision for offshore fish. The extractive uses of the mangroves present a threat to their survival (Abuodha and Kairo 2001), but also an opportunity for community involvement in their conservation. Previous community reforesting schemes at Gazi have proven successful, and the current project will attempt to build on that success by helping to sustain the supply of mangrove goods and services by involving the local community in the replanting campaign.
The people of Gazi will learn first-hand how to maintain, use, and rebuild mangrove forests so that their resource of wood and a productive fishing environment will always exist. Furthermore, over the next four years, five people will be employed to work on mangrove management, with additional occasional work for other villagers in preparing nurseries for future plantings. For this project to be successful at restoring the coastal mangroves, the community needs to be committed and involved in restoring them. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-illinois-emiquon-wetland-restoration-project/	USA: Illinois: Emiquon Wetland Restoration Project	United States of America	2007-05-23	2007-05-23	"The Emiquon Wetland Restoration Project is a large-scale project that aims to restore approximately 7,100 acres of land owned by the Nature Conservancy. Once, this land was floodplain on the Illinois River, but in the early 20th Century, the land was drained and turned into farmland. The Nature Conservancy and its partners want to restore to the site into a functional flood plain and also return its ability to sustain native plant, fish, and wildlife species. Once completed, this project could positively impact the water quality in the Illinois River, increase tourism for the area, and restore the biological diversity of the Illinois River. Another purpose of this project is to provide educational and recreational opportunities to visitors of the Emiquon Preserve.This project is science-based; scientists have been monitoring this site since before restoration began. The first phase of restoration was to stop pumping water off the site, allowing water to fill the land. In 2007, thousands of plants and seeds have been planted to help provide some biodiversity. Non-native fish have been removed and native fish have been introduced into these new waters. Eventually, the waters at Emiquon will be reunited with the Illinois River, returning the natural flood cycle to the area. Based on the results of these early phases, scientists will produce recommendations for further restoration efforts.Agriculture & Livestock The Illinois River was channelized and dams were erected, to control its flood cycle. The native plants and animals were well-adapted to the seasonal flooding and many species could not persist without it, even without further land-use changes. Additionally, increasing urbanization has brought higher levels of pollution and invasive species to the Illinois River.
The Emiquon area used to be a highly productive wetland. But the land was converted into highly fertile farmland. Levees were erected and the water drained from the area by using pumps and ditches. This caused the loss of many plant and animal species (both commercial non-commercial) from the area. The Illinois River floodplain had a diversity of wetland habitats from shallow lakes to emergent vegetation. Prior to being levied and drained, this area was wet year-round. Seasonal flooding from the Illinois River provided nutrients for a tremendous biological diversity, including dozens of species of native plants, fish, and wildlife. The wetlands provided an important stopping point for migratory waterfowl. These wetlands also provided a natural filter to cleanse the water that flowed into the Illinois River, improving its water quality.
Historical paperwork indicates that the site was once home to many types of trees, such as black walnut, swamp white oak, and northern pecan. The site also contained mussels and commercial fisheries at one time. Goals as set forth in Reuter et al. 2005.
1. Develop, test, and export successful techniques for restoring and sustaining the natural biological diversity of large floodplain river ecosystem;
2. Incorporate the principles of adaptive management as a necessary component of natural area management.;
3. Demonstrate the benefits of ecological restoration of critical habitats for threatened and endangered species;
4. Evaluate the potential for storing floodwaters and reducing unnatural water level fluctuations;
5. Promote the ecological and cultural importance of the Emiquon area by developing and implementing educational programs;
6. Demonstrate that natural area conservation efforts can be an important component of local and regional economic development strategies; and
7. Provide excellent recreational opportunities.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The Nature Conservancy had purchased 7,100 acres of former wetlands with the intention of restoring the area.
On February 18, 2007, the Nature Conservancy officially partnered with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). By enrolling 6,285 of the 7,100 acres in the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) for a conservation easement for 30 years, allowing the Nature Conservancy to retire some of its debt. The WRP is a program that offers landowners a subsidy for wetlands they restore based on the agricultural value of the land.
Dickson Mounds Museum, located adjacent Emiquon plans to remodel its first floor to become the visitor center for Emiquon, allowing the Nature Conservancy to focus its funds on restoration.
The University of Illinois at Springfield is constructing a field station on site that will provide both lab and teaching space. Scientists will be able to gather scientific data and monitor the progress of restoration.
The local officials and citizens of Fulton County (which contains most of the land for the Emiquon Project). They will lose the tax revenue from farmland but may gain revenue from tourism.
Illinois Department of Natural Resources

Description of Project Activities: - TNC purchased land and ceased agricultural activity on it. 
 - A groundwater project used observation wells, gauges, and mapping of the water table to assess how deep the water would be and how long the area would remain flooded once the water was no longer pumped from the site.  
 - Baseline studies of soil, plants, wildlife, were conducted.  
 - For three years, scientists have been studying water quality and microbial counts in areas in and around Emiquon.  
 - Then, they stopped pumping water, allowing areas that were once shallow lakes and wetlands to fill up.  
 - A UIS student has conducted a seed bank study using soil from the Illinois River floodplain.  
 - For Emiquon, they used the results found at Spunky Bottoms, a similar site along the Illinois River, to guide their restoration efforts.  They knew from that site that the seed bank would supply native plants as soon as the water returned.  They also knew that native wildlife would follow the plant life and establish on the site.
 - During 2007, 1,400 acres of Emiquon will be planted including:  180,000 trees (pecan, burr oak, swamp white oak and sycamore), 8,000 pounds of seed (6 types of grass and 59 forbs), 90,000 upland shrubs and trees.
 - Established trees will be fortified in a timber stand improvement project. 
 - Non-native aquatic species will be removed and native fish species put into the system
 - The Emiquon Field Station will conduct scientific research and provide web-based results to the general public, making the science of the Emiquon Project more accessible to both scientists and laypeople
 - The University of Illinois, Springfield will use the Emiquon Field Station as an educational facility with courses that will involve intense field work at Emiquon.
 - A visitor center in conjunction with Dixon Mounds Museum is planned to provide educational opportunities to go alongside the recreational activities.  
 - Monitoring of water quality (such as dissolved oxygen, temperature, and pH), plant, and animal life is ongoing throughout the phases of restoration.  This monitoring will guide future restoration efforts 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: - Water has been returned to the site because pumping has been stopped. The site has not yet been reconnected with the Illinois River.  Since turning off pumps in April 2007, an estimated 700 acres have been inundated. Eventually the lakebeds may encompass 3,000 or more acres of this land.
 - The Illinois Department of Natural Resources has eradicated invasive aquatic species (including carp) in early 2007.  
 - Local hatcheries supplied several species of native and sport fish.
 - By the end of 2007, hundreds of thousands of native seedlings and seeds will have been planted on site.
 - A bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) hatched on site in 2006
 - Dozens of Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) have bred on site due to the installation of nest boxes.  
 - Based on results at nearby Spunky Bottoms, scientists expect native birds, mammal, reptiles, and amphibians to use the site once the wetland is established.
 - Scientific inquiry will continue based out of the Emiquon Field Station to monitor water quality, microbes, plants, and wildlife.  
 - Research has been conducted on using the growth and reproduction of moist-soil plants as a metric for the level of success in recreating the natural flooding regimes of the Illinois River floodplain. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: It will be difficult to restore connectivity from this site to the Illinois River, while excluding pollution and invasive species.  

Also, many Fulton County residents oppose returning this site into the wetland it once was so any planned restoration activities may be subject to public opposition and regulation from local, state, and federal authorities.  The main concerns of the residents are the loss of farmland revenue and the possibility that the wetlands will increase the spread of disease by mosquitoes.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: This project may have economic benefits for Fulton County which would benefit from increased tourism and increased recreational industry to the area due to the Emiquon Project.  
This restored site will be a large tract Illinois River floodplain which will function as a storehouse for biological diversity and when finished, will restore ecosystem function.  Better management of flood plains can reduce pollution and nutrient levels in oceans which, in turn, reduces the environmental and economic damage of urbanization and agriculture.
This project is still in its beginning phases. Preliminary data show that it has been successful so far. This project seeks to restore the ecosystem function of part of the Illinois River floodplain. This program will be monitored by scientists using the Emiquon Field Station on site. Scientific research will guide future management and restoration activities.
Baseline soil and water quality were measured and baseline plant and animals surveys were conducted which gives a starting point to which all future measurements can be compared. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/taiwan-anping-harbor-mangrove-restoration-project-at-tainan-city/	Taiwan: Anping Harbor Mangrove Restoration Project at Tainan City	Taiwan	1998-06-01	2005-12-01	"This project involved the restoration of two small areas within Anping Harbor: the Lungkang community channel and the Chienkang road mangrove protection area. At the Lungkang site, a mixture of R. stylosa propagules and nursery-reared L. racemosa seedlings was planted, and at the Chienkang site, PVC pipes were employed as an encasement for the establishment of R. stylosa propagules.Urbanization, Transportation & Industry The third stage of Anping harbor’s construction resulted in the degradation of the entire mangrove forest around the small fishing community. The main goal of this project is to restore the R. stylosa and Lumnitzera racemosa mangrove species, destroyed by harbor construction, and to plant Kandelia candel, a species dominant in north Taiwan. This project tries to establish a high biodiversity mangrove ecosystem within an urban wetland, in order to reach the goals of ecological conversion and environmental education.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The primary stakeholder in this project is the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau, which is a subordinate of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.

Description of Project Activities: Lungkang community channel -- The planting soil near the channel was wet, and we directly sowed a mix of R. stylosa propagules and L. racemosa seedlings (six months old) during the spring rainy days. In the mean time, we planted Sesuvium portulacastrum on the dry slope, in hopes of preventing soil erosion.

Chienkang road mangrove protection area --We used PVC planting pipes to restore mangroves in a flooded area. The PVC pipes had an inside diameter of 10 cm, and were cut to lengths of 150 and 50 cm. Workers drilled five to ten small holes along the whole length of each pipe to allow water exchange. In July 1998, the 150 cm pipes were driven into the soil to a depth of 50 cm in the deepwater area. The 50 cm PVC pipes were placed (with 20 cm inserted into the soil) in a small flood area where the highest flooding was approximately 50 cm. Each pipe was filled with muddy sediment from the surface, creating an artificial bottom, and the R. stylosa propagules with new roots were then planted into the top of the PVC pipes. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Lungkang community channel --L. racemosa grew very fast, and 30 months after planting, the average tree height was 200 cm. The directly sown R. stylosa propagules had a lower tree height (80-120 cm). During the restoration period, many A. marina seedlings were established by natural regeneration, and now, three mangrove species have presented beautiful scenery.

Chienkang road mangrove protection area --At the shallow area of the Cheinkang site, we directly sowed R. stylosa propagules and planted L. racemosa (ten months old) seedlings under an A. marina tree canopy, at the edge of the forest and at the heavy scour opening small area. Directly sowing R. stylosa propagules among Avicennia trees has given a survival rate of only 30%. The high mortality rate is due to polluted soil, algal damage and heavy water turbulence. However, some saplings have grown very strongly, especially those with abundant prop roots on the favorable fringe sites near the waterway. Eight years after planting, the saplings reached a mean height of over 400 cm, with many propagules emerging. L. racemosa seedlings had a survival rate of 62.4% in the first year. The seedlings grew to a height of 110 cm and flowered.

Unfortunately at the flooded area of the Cheinkang site, due to serious multiple stresses, the seedling survival rate for this project was less than 5% after two months. The area was replanted several times during November 1998 and November 1999 with R. stylosa propagules and L. racemosa seedlings. Field investigations show that some vigorous R. stylosa seedlings grew extremely well in 50 cm PVC pipes, with a seedling height of 85-110 cm. The proliferating prop roots were established in muddy soil, which provides stability and essential nutrients, and the first propagule was noted on the seedlings three years after planting (photo 29). Eight years after planting, the height of R. stylosa saplings was over 5 m, and they were in a green, healthy and vigorous state.

The R. stylosa container seedlings replanted in the 150 cm PVC pipes at the Cheinkang site also grew well, reaching a height of 75 cm and producing several prop roots. Four years after planting, their prop roots gradually reached the bottom soil.

The survival rate of L. racemosa seedlings grown in 150 cm PVC pipes was around 80%, and the seedlings produced fruits in the first year. However, the seedling height was only 60 cm throughout the first three years. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Lungkang community channel-- The whole area was intended to be the container yard of Anping Harbor, and only one small channel could be provided for mangrove restoration. However, the position of this channel was very close to boat anchorage, and fishermen worked nearby everyday. Soil here was very hard, with high salinity and a lot of oyster shell present. Basically, this is not the typical habitat for mangrove growth.

Chienkang road mangrove protection area-- At the shallow areas, limiting factors include a large amount of garbage, fishery waste, algae, heavy scour in winter, oil and chemical material pollution due to the industry area nearby. High salinity was also a factor, as was the flourishing canopy of A. marina, which suppressed the saplings by limiting available sunlight. At the flooded areas, the major limiting factor was a lack of soil for seedling establishment, but an abundance of garbage, bamboo poles floating on the water surface, and heavy water turbulence by boats also limited success.
1. It is important to understand the characteristics (including tolerance of salinity, flood and temperature) of each mangrove species in advance. Directly sowing propagules or planting seedlings at the proper position and during the right season would increase the chance for successful restoration.
2. It is necessary to culture L. racemosa seedlings at a nursery in advance (6 – 9 month old container seedlings). The advantage of directly sowing R. stylosa propagules is that it is an easy and cheap method. I recommend this is the best method for mangrove restoration according to this project.
3. Each mangrove species grows very fast, and in this project we planted a mixture of mangrove seedlings with a high density. Four years after planting, the competition showed between individual trees, so I suggest thinning is the most important work after restoration.
4. This project has shown that PVC pipes may be an effective, cheap and easy method for planting mangroves at flood areas. However, there are still many problems. For example, in the initial stage, many deep fish habitats have been in the tray circle, affecting the erection of 150 cm PVC pipes. In the later period, many barnacles attached on the prop roots, and this might affect the growth of sapling in the future.
5. R. stylosa is the only species that can grow in PVC pipes because of its dense prop root. L. racemosa, K. candel and A. marina are not proper species to grow in PVC pipes.
6. PVC pipes could be used at flood areas where the water depth did not exceed 50 cm, and also at polluted sites. However, PVC pipe becomes fragile in salty water and sun light, which may limit sapling growth. The restoration project was completed in 2005, and no funding has been received to maintain this habitat. The administrative right for the project area will transfer to the Tainan City Government, and the government may cooperate with a local conservation organization to plan a conservation park for leisure, bird watching and environmental education.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-minnesota-grassy-point-st-louis-river-estuary-duluth/	USA: Minnesota: Grassy Point, St. Louis River Estuary (Duluth)	United States of America	1994-10-01	1996-03-31	"Grassy Point is a small area of wetland where the St. Louis River meets Lake Superior. Although it is only about 100 acres of land, this restoration project is important because it is a part of the vast Lake Superior basin. Grassy Point used to be home to several sawmills which unfortunately left debris behind to clog up the waters. This project eventually removed 11,000 cubic yards of wood debris from the site and reformed several channels during 1994-1996. Debris removal helped the ecosystem to function more naturally, created habitat, and provided an opportunity for several other projects aimed at educating the public and creating a stewardship ethic.Other This site was home to many sawmills around the turn of the last century because it gave them great access for shipping. Several different sawmills were located on Grassy Point until 1918 when the Cloquet fires put an end to commercial activity on site. No other commercial use of this site has been documented.
On Grassy Point these saw mills left a tremendous amount of wood waste (more than 16 feet deep in some places) which has hindered the movement of fish and the growth of aquatic vegetation. The waste wood has not significantly decomposed over time and can be found exposed above the surface of the water in many locations. In 1861, a surveying party charting the mouth of the St. Louis River found an area that was a mosaic of marsh types, likely covered with grasses, sedges, cattail, and other acquatic plants.
Birds identified on site up until the 1970s include Least Bittern, Virginia Rails, Green Heron, Sora Rail, and Snow Goose. This site was important breeding habitat for Ring-billed Gulls and Common terns. This site was also home to Painted and Snapping Turtles in great abundance. This area was also habitat for Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Shiners. This project sought to restore habitat area and ecological function to the Grassy Point wetland by removing the sawmill debris that had been onsite for about ninety years. Although this site has a small area, it fits in with the larger goal of restoring areas within the Lake Superior Basin which is of concern to both the United States and Canada.
Another goal for the project was to increase feelings of public stewardship of the area. As a result of the original project, several projects aimed at increasing public support have been initiated on Grassy Point including:
– Grassy Point public access with a parking lot and park benches
– Removal of additional fill in the wetland that was a result of building a road
– Public access increased by several trail creation projects
– Access blocked for areas where illegal dumping is common
– Control of Purple Loosestrife, an invasive wetland plant

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: - As early as 1977, Grassy Point and the areas surrounding it were recognized as important habitat for native fish, birds, and wildlife due to the unique mosaic of marsh vegetation types.  

 - During 1994/1995, DNR hired contractors to describe the location and depth of sawmill waste as well as to determine whether or not there were chemical contaminants buried with the wood.
 - They completed 112 borings on 200 foot grid to a depth of 10 feet below the existing surface or 2 feet beyond existing wood waste.
 - 4 sediment samples were collected and sent away for analysis.
 - Although there were some metals present in the samples, all concentrations came back at ""No Effect Level"" as defined by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.
 - Total PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) ranged from 0.13 mg/kg to 0.96 mg/kg. All samples were below the Ontario Sediment Quality Guidelines ""lowest biological effect"" level of 2.0 mg/kg. 
 - There was no evidence that wood waste was drawing in any organic contaminants or concentrating them as may happen when woody debris is buried in sediment that is contaminated.
 - Based on the initial studies, restoration design plans were implemented.
 - Excavations were made to connect Keene Creek with the St. Louis River and to create ponds that branched off from this or the main channel.  These excavations were to be at the most 6 feet deep and have gently sloping sides.  
 - During 1995/1996, 11,000 cubic yards of wood waste were removed form the site.
 - Baseline data and monitoring data was collected
 - Monitoring is reported to be ongoing. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Clearing this site of debris opened up habitat for native plants, birds, wildlife, and fish.  
In September of 1996, eleven fish species were using the site as a result of the open water areas that had been created.
This project spawned several other projects aimed at increasing public access to this site in hopes to create a sense of public stewardship of the environment. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: This site has made the expected recovery due to the restoration action.  Grassy Point is part of a greater ecosystem, the Lake Superior Watershed.  Anything that affects this watershed such as pollution, loss of species, or lreduced evel of public interest in the environment is likely to affect this site.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The removal of 11,000 cubic yards of debris has allowed the ecosystem to function more naturally and given the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources an opportunity to provide educational resources to the public.
This project is considered a success.
According to the Minnesota DNR, the lessons learned are (from http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/rprp/grassypoint/index.html):
– Degraded areas CAN be enhanced & restored with resourcefulness and planning.
– But the costs of restoring degraded ecosystem function greatly exceed the costs of proactive protection and maintenance.
– Restoring degraded areas can serve as a catalyst for other community-based actions to protect natural resources Monitoring is reported to be on-going. The major causes of the degradation, sawmills, are no longer operating in the area. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/thailand-mangrove-restoration-at-klong-ngao-in-the-ranong-biosphere-reserve/	Thailand: Mangrove Restoration at Klong Ngao in the Ranong Biosphere Reserve	Thailand	2007-05-22	2007-05-22	"After a history of commercial exploitation the mangroves along the Klong Ngao tidal creek have been assigned conservation status within a new Ranong Biosphere Reserve established in 1997 on the Andaman Sea coast of southern Thailand. Over the past 12 years, several areas of mangrove destroyed or degraded by wood harvesting, tin mining and aquaculture, have been rehabilitated on a pilot basis by planting monocultures of mangrove seedlings using four common local species (Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata, Bruguiera cyclindrica and Ceriops tagal).Deforestation, Fisheries & Aquaculture, Mining & Resource Extraction The Ranong mangroves include blocks of former concession forest, disused tin mining areas and abandoned shrimp ponds. _

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: Nine mangrove sites at four locations with different management histories were identified along Klong Ngao. At each study site a 100 m2 vegetation plot (10 m_10 m) was marked out. A second replicate 100 m2 quadrat was made for each mangrove species at location 3. Within each 100 m2 quadrat, the total number of tree species and the number of individuals per species were determined. The diameter of each tree was recorded using callipers and from this the cross-sectional area, or basal area (BA), was calculated for each tree to give an indication of growth (English et al., 1997). Tree height was recorded using an extendable measuring pole. The abundance of seedlings and undergrowth species was recorded in 10_1 m2 quadrats within each 100 m2 vegetation plot. Soil samples were collected in each 100 m2 vegetation plot at low tide from a depth of 30-50 cm using a soil corer. The soil samples were put into labelled, airtight, plastic bags and taken to the laboratory for analysis. The samples were weighed before and after oven drying (on aluminium foil at 80 _C for 24 h) to determine the water loss by evaporation. Soil moisture content was calculated as a percentage of wet mass. Salinity and pH were measured in surface water and in porewater at a depth of 50 cm at each study site. Salinity was measured using an optical refractometer (Atago, Japan). A portable pH meter (Portamess 911 pH, Knick, Berlin) and a Gel-Plast electrode (Hamilton, Switzerland), which was calibrated with pH 4 and 7 standard buffers, was used to measure pH. The temperature of the soil at 50 cm depth was recorded in situ at low tide using a _20 _C to +60 _C soil thermometer (Gundlach, Denmark). The total numbers of green (freshly fallen), yellow (senescent) and brown (decaying) leaves were counted in 10_1 m2 quadrats. A shore profile was prepared for each study site by surveying at low tide with a total station; shore heights were referenced to a known tidal level above chart datum. Tidal inundation was then calculated for each site (number of days per year reached by high tides) using published tide tables for Ranong Harbour and the methods of English et al.(1997). 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: This present study recorded significant differences in the community structure of intertidal crabs and molluscs between the rehabilitated sites and the mature mangrove forest at site 1a. Overall, the species diversity indices were high for location 1, but faunal density and biomass were lower in the mature forest
compared to the mangrove plantations. There is greater habitat heterogeneity in the mature forest, with six common mangrove tree species and a well developed soil structure. In this respect, one important
feature of site 1a which was not quantified in the sampling programme, is the presence of many large earthen mounds created by the mudlobster Thalassina anomala. This animal was not evident in the plantation sites, except for some old mounds covering a small part of location 3. Mud lobster mounds provide niche opportunities for other crustaceans, especially sesarmid crabs (Macnae, 1968).

The 10-year-old Rhizophora plantation at the former tin mining site still has a reduced macrofauna diversity compared to the 4 and 5-year-old plantations at the degraded former concession forest area, but this almost certainly reflects the much greater habitat disturbance associated previously with tin mining.

The mixed Rhizophora plantation in the former shrimp pond is most similar to the mature forest both in terms of tree species number and basal area and mollusc species composition, abundance, diversity and biomass. Although the earth dyke around the pond remains intact, the mangroves planted within the former pond experience a nearly normal tidal regime. This seems to be the principal reason why the survival and growth of the trees has been very high at location 4. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Mangrove vegetation is well known to respond to, and moderate the environmental conditions prevailing
in different intertidal zones and habitats (e.g. Kathiresan & Bingham, 2001). In the present study vegetation community structure was not correlated with the environmental data collected. This is not
surprising because the mangroves in sites 2-4 were planted artificially, mainly as monocultures irrespective of the local environmental conditions. Tree development and natural colonization by other species is just beginning to modify habitat conditions in the plantations. The importance of mangrove species selection for rehabilitation clearly merits further investigation, as relatively few types of mangrove have been used to date, Rhizophora being the preferred choice (Field, 1996).

The mangrove forest at the Klong Ngao tin mine site remains sparse and the Rhizophora trees have developed huge root systems, suggesting that the environmental conditions at the site are still very stressful for mangroves. The tin mining site was almost completely barren in 1985 before it was replanted (Macintosh pers. obs.). Ten years later, with mangrove vegetation now well established as described in the present study, the macrofauna has increased to seven molluscan species (including oysters) and eight crab species. However, the former tin mine site is still dominated by the crab Metaplax elegans, which prefers soft silty sediment and lower shores (e.g. Tesch, 1918; Jones, 1986). As a result of the removal of sediments for tin extraction and corresponding disruption to the habitat, site 2 is still at an earlier stage of ecological recovery compared to the other plantation sites.
From an environmental management perspective, the results from Klong Ngao suggest that some groups of the macrofauna may be useful as biological indicators to assess the ecological impact of mangrove rehabilitation. A high dominance of one species of macrofauna (as in the case of Metaplax elegans at the former tin mining site) may indicate a stressful environment, whereas a higher diversity (e.g. of sesarmid species) may be indicative of a more stable, mature forest (as in site 1a).
The concept of ecological indicator species has been used effectively in temperate regions and could be developed similarly for mangrove systems. The structure of mangrove crustacean and molluscan communities could be a useful tool for habitat assessment, but further research on the ecological role of nominated indicator/key species is needed.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/venezuela-mangrove-restoration-in-laguna-de-la-restinga-national-park-margarita-island/	Venezuela: Mangrove Restoration in Laguna de la Restinga National Park (Margarita Island)	Venezuela	2004-01-01	2004-01-01	"This project, entitled Migratory Neotropical Birds and the Restoration of the Coastal Mangroves of Venezuela, is conducted by the organization Provita and seeks to restore 49 acres (20 hectares) of mangroves in Laguna de la Restinga National Park. The mangroves are located along the coastal plain of the central isthmus of Margarita Island, in the most important area of the island for threatened migratory aquatic birds. The project aims to replicate in La Restinga a very successful wetlands creation project done in Colombia, which used mangrove areas as biological filters. The project will also establish the natural flows of water in the park. Another important project activity is the identification of areas critical to migratory birds and the creation of a map with the types of habitat and the evaluation of possible management activities that favor these animals. During the restoration, we will document environmental changes that result in the arrival of new species of migratory birds that generally nest in mangroves. An important component of the project is community participation in monitoring, environmental education, and planning, including tourism, which is very important for the island. This project is the first time mangrove restoration has been tried in Venezuela, an experience that we plan to use as a model for other areas of La Restinga, Laguna de Tacarigua National Park, and other regions of the country.Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants), Mining & Resource Extraction The park is threatened by illegal hunting, exotic species introduction, the extraction of sand and stone for construction, illegal fisheries, growing pressure from tourism, flora and fauna extraction, an increase in human population pressure, and the absence of a strong institutional presence to regulate and keep watch over its management and conservation. Approximately 1058 ha of mangrove forests surround and cover La Restinga national park. Several internal lagoons interrupt these forests creating canals of singular beauty that go off in all directions and provide ideal spawning conditions for many marine species (Hoyos 1985). Red and black mangroves (Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia germinans) cover the main body and edges of the lagoon. The first spans approximately 500 ha and the latter about 400 ha in the canals with less circulation. White mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa) is found in the western sector of the lagoon and the buttonwood or button mangrov(Conocarpus erectus) is on the lagoon edges where there is less water. Because the sand bar substrate is mainly sand and shells it has a special type of vegetation. Mangroves dominate towards the eastern end of the lagoon. In the west, shrubs, creepers (like the introduced Asian species Calotropis procera) and other halophilous species such as beachwort (Batis maritime) and purslane (Portulaca oleracea) dominate. Among the arboreal species are Cercidium praecox, Cordia dentata, Cesalpinia coriara, Parkinsonia aculeata, Bourreria cumanensis and Prosopis juliflora. Individuals of these species are generally dwarfed due to the poor soil. Cacti like Ritterocereus griseus, Subpilocerus repandus, Piloerus lanuginosus, Pereskia guamacho, Opuntia wentiana, Opuntia schumanii, Opuntia caribea, Melocactus caesius and Acanthocereus tetragonus, are also abundant (Hoyos 1985).
Margarita Island is especially important with respect to the numbers of endemic species it harbors. The island was connected to mainland until the Pleistocene. As a result, there is a predominance of typical continental bird families like Tinamidae, Dendrocolaptidae, Formicaridae and Furnaridae (Bisbal 2001), which are for example totally absent from the Antilles. There are 31 mammal species on Margarita, of which La Restinga holds important
populations of two endemic subspecies, Margarita’s cotton-tailed rabbit Sylvilagus floridanus margaritae and the white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus margaritae.
Four species of sea turtles nest on beaches located within the park. The most common is the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). The hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), the green turtle (Chelonia mydas) and the loggerhead (Caretta caretta) are also found within the park boundaries. According to IUCN criteria, the first two are critically threatened with extinction, and the latter two are globally threatened. In the Red Book of Venezuelan Fauna, the loggerhead is classified as vulnerable and the other three species as endangered (RodríÂ­guez and Rojas-Suárez 1999). During the year 2001, 323 nesting events were recorded on Margarita Island. There were over 8,000 eggs by the end of the season (GTTMNE 2002). Approximately 12% of these nests were laid on park beaches. This year 39 turtles were reported in the park, 32 of which were nesting (Vernet 2001).
Of the 107 species of birds reported from Margarita, 21 are migratory and 15 of these are restricted to Margarita and Trinidad in the Caribbean islands and 16 are restricted solely to Margarita in their Caribbean range (Rojas-Suárez et al. 1998). Among the latter, the greenbacked heron Butorides striatus robinsoni is endemic to Margarita and Trinidad, while another 7 species are endemic only to Margarita: Margarita’s ferruginous pygmy owl, Glaucidium brasilianum margaritae, the yellow oriole Icterus nigrogularis helioeides, the pale-breasted spinetail Synallaxis albescens nesiotes, Margarita’s brown-throated parakeet Aratinga pertinax margaritensis, the straight-billed woodpecker Xiphorhynchus picus longirostris, the bluecrowned parakeet Aratinga acuticaudata neoxena and the clapper rail Rallus longirostris margaritae (Rojas-Suárez et al. 1998). The last three species are endemic to the park and its surroundings. ** Train park personnel in environmental vigilance, law enforcement, ecological restoration, and wildlife monitoring.
** Restore dead mangrove forests in La Restinga National Park.
** Identify and strengthen the protection of critical habitats for migratory birds.
** Design habitat conservation plans to recover the park’s most threatened species.
** Create baseline information about the distribution and abundance of migratory birds and begin a long-term monitoring program.
** Design and implement environmental education and public awareness programs that highlight the role of the La Restinga and Tacarigua National Parks as wetlands of international importance, and as sites of great value for migratory birds.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
There are several distinct groups of stakeholders with an interest in the outcome of this project. The local population has an interest in the restoration, as the mangrove provides protection from storm damage and erosion, fresh water, an important source of wood and an abundant source of food from scores of fish and mollusk species that depend on this natural nursery. Moreover, Provita also hopes to train local residents so they can be nature guides and own small, low-impact tourism businesses.
Tourists and tour operators are stakeholders in the project, as about 70 boatmen make their living from taking both local and foreign tourists through the serene and wild mangroves. In fact, it was this group of boatmen that first raised the alarm about increasing deterioration.
National park personnel represent another important group of stakeholders. The project has as one of its objectives the training of park employees in environmental vigilance, law enforcement, ecological restoration, and wildlife monitoring.
Stakeholders in environmental education will also be stakeholders in this restoration project. One of the project goals is to design and implement environmental education and public awareness programs that highlight the role of the La Restinga and Tacarigua National Parks as wetlands of international importance, and as sites of great value for migratory birds. Five young people from the community, called “bio-monitors,” are participating in the project, collecting data about mangrove tree species and thereby gaining valuable insight into conservation and ecology. Other important project allies are the teachers in five local public schools, who teach students about the importance of La Restinga as an internationally significant wetland and one that is invaluable to them, their families and neighbors, migratory birds, and other wildlife. Also as part of the project, a list of common and easily identified birds will be developed for each restoration site, effectively investing students, amateur birdwatchers, and park guards in biological monitoring activities.
Lastly, the international community at large constitutes a group of stakeholders, as Laguna de la Restinga National Park has been designated a Ramsar site. It is a wetland of recognized international importance and is the only site in the Caribbean that is home to wild carnivores, including ocelots and the Amazonian hog-nosed skunk. Moreover, loggerhead, hawksbill, and green sea turtles nest on the park’s beaches.

Description of Project Activities: The first step of the project was the implementation of a geographic information system (GIS) for the island. Using the ArcView 3.3 software and 1:100,000 paper base maps, in collaboration with a team of students based at IVIC (Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas) we digitized the island, its protected areas, roads, hydrological network, and population centers. These data were placed in IVIC's website in mid 2004, and are available without cost to anyone interested (ecosig.ivic.ve). As we develop further georeferenced datasets, they will be added to the database as well.

Over the last year and a half, fifteen rural schools around the Macanao area have been participating in reseeding activities under Provita's supervision, planting more than 3.000 mangroves plants and more than 4.500 new dry forest plants.

After PROVITA's technical presentation in 2007, representatives of the Environmental Ministry, together with 5 other local governmental institutions and 9 representatives of the sand mining companies, agreed that the need for an integrated ecological restoration program for Macanao and La Restinga is urgent. Thus, the project has enlisted the support of influential local agencies as well as members of the business community. 
Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The limited funding which supports Provita's activities (i.e. human resources, financial resources and infrastructure) is a limiting factor, as it is for any NGO. We realize there is a need to increase our presence in the area with more researchers and an actual research and capacity building infrastructure inside Macanao--and we have the sketch and blueprints to build a Conservation and Development Center in this area. However, due to a lack of funding, we haven't yet been able to realize this goal.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Since the establishment of the project in 2004, Provita has developed and strengthened a collaborative network of 35 teachers and 3,500 children at 15 schools across the Macanao peninsula, as well as in the towns of Chacachacare and La Restinga (which are located just outside of Macanao). Our interactions with the schools are directed by the teacher participants of the workshops described above, who organize ""environmental brigades"" with their students. Therefore, teachers serve two functions: they formally implement and evaluate the impact of educational interventions, and they also organize the most motivated students to carry out other conservation activities. This affords a valuable opportunity for environmental education and community involvement in the project.
We will hold meetings with local stakeholders at least once a month throughout the different stages of the project. We will periodically analyze the project’s successes and weaknesses, with the goal of designing phase two.
Before starting field work a geographic information system was used to create a database of available cartographic information, superimposing this onto recent Landsat satellite images. This, along with consultations with park personnel, will lead to creation of a vegetation map and a map of the principal threats to the park. Later, we will select permanent monitoring sites to count birds, based on the relative importance of these sites for migratory birds. We will use a telescope to do these censuses in selected sites at least once every two months throughout the year. Permanent monitoring will be done from the highest peak during the highest migration period. In addition to the migratory birds, we will compile a list of easily identified common birds for each of the sites. The idea is to develop a monitoring program that is accessible to students, birdwatchers, amateur naturalists, and park rangers. This will increase the number of potential park monitors, as they will not need to possess advanced skills for bird observation.
In the future we plan to restore mangrove forests within coastal communities in order to reduce human pressures on the protected mangroves. Because the project will include an environmental education component and planning with the communities, local residents are understanding that the mangroves benefit them. We strongly believe that without the involvement of local communities, long-term success is not possible. This has been the central point of our work in conservation and the sustainable use of biodiversity in the La Restiga and Tacarigua National Parks for 13 years. We have focused on threatened species and habitats, directing the public’s attention to those cases that are most urgent. In this way, people come to identify with their own resources. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/kenya-community-mangrove-rehabilitation-conservation-and-sustainable-management-in-tsunza-bay/	Kenya: Community Mangrove Rehabilitation, Conservation and Sustainable Management in Tsunza Bay	Kenya	1999-02-26	1999-02-26	"Through its grassroots community work in Tsunza Bay, Kenya, the Tsunza Conservation and Development Programme (TCDP) is working to restore degraded mangroves and promote sustainable management and utilization of these resources as a means of ensuring future livelihood activities. The initiative is comprised of three distinct components: the rehabilitation of degraded mangrove forest areas, the raising of villagers’ awareness through training and information dissemination, and community-based, long-term management achieved through various capacity building efforts.Mining & Resource Extraction Along the coast, commercial logging of mangroves for use as fuel wood in industrial concerns–e.g. brick factories and industrial and urban development–have been responsible for widespread degradation and loss of mangrove forests. The initiative’s long-term goal is to establish an integrated system of sustainable economic development and coastal resource management. In order to move toward that goal, the first priority has been the rehabilitation of degraded mangrove sites. Next, TCDP has sought to raise community awareness of environmental issues and to educate villagers about the centrality of healthy mangroves to socio-economic vitality. Lastly, the project aims to assure local involvement in the development and implementation of a sustainable management plan.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Informal cooperation at the field level between the Forest Department, Kenya Marine Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), villagers, schools and other community organizations has been particularly fruitful and should be sustained after the current project span. The support by the local government of the villagers’ efforts (with help from the project) to patrol the mangrove forests for illegal mangrove cutters has been one such example. In several meetings, workshops and seminars on mangrove management in Tsunza, representatives from the government, private sector, academic institutions, media and grassroots organizations worked together to formulate a joint strategic Action Plan for better mangrove management. This increased cooperation, communication and sharing and will continue to pay off well into the future.

Description of Project Activities: Three villages in Tsunza Bay were selected as the target communities for the mangrove resource management and rehabilitation: Tsunza, Dzivani and Lutsanganiimteza. Participation by village representatives was achieved through involvement in workshops, meetings, planning and implementation of project activities. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Substantial strides were made in the rehabilitation of the mangrove forest, as an area of approximately 100 hectares of severely degraded mangroves was replanted with approximately 2 million mangrove seedlings. The seedlings are showing good survival rates to date, and the restored area has been made available for the local community (after discussions with and approval by local government and the Forest Department). Not only that, marine resources and biodiversity have recovered somewhat, and some species of birds and other marine life that had previously disappeared have been sighted again.

Since the inception of the TCDP, approximately 3,000 hectares of mangrove forest have been placed under community management and entrusted to the stewardship of local villagers. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The survival of the replanted mangrove trees in plots at the community forest site of Mwangoa was hampered significantly in the early days by drought, grazing goats and sheep and very high soil salinity levels. The initial survival rates of the experimental sites were below 30%, which dampened the enthusiasm of some members of the community. This problem was addressed by proper fencing of the sites, hydrological restoration of some sites through the digging of tidal channels and manual adjustments to surface topography. The hydrology of most of these sites is now characterized by proper flooding at high tide and proper drainage during low tides and periods of substantial rainfall. This has improved soil conditions and consequently the survival and growth rates of the replanted mangroves.

Besides physical limitations, forest recovery has also been hampered somewhat by a lack of adequate manpower and equipment. Laws and regulations pertaining to mangrove forest conservation and marine resource exploitation have not yet been aggressively enforced due to this shortage of personnel.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Based on current local prices one could calculate that within a few years the 200 hectares of replanted mangroves in Tsunza will represent a potential economic benefit of over 50 million shillings. Thus, villagers have already benefited from a substantial increase in their economic base.

One exciting consequence of the project's support for alternative livelihood activities--e.g. beekeeping, livestock, broom making, and a cultural dance troupe--seems to have been a resultant increase in local interest. Villagers have been convinced to participate in the project, and the atmosphere of poverty and despair is slowly changing into one of hope and a willingness to struggle for a way out of social and economic marginalization.

Yet it is clear that only a certain proportion of the villagers (possibly less than 20%) actively participate in the project and as such, the most direct benefits must have largely gone to them. Only in the longer term will the indirect benefits such as the mangrove related improvements in fish catch and the opportunity to harvest mangrove poles from the community forest be accessible to other members of the community.
The lack of clear, measurable indicators of progress has contributed to some degree of uncertainty, skepticism and even opposition among the target communities, and other stakeholders. The project has taken a flexible and open approach, putting considerable effort in the creation of a strong sense of local ownership of the process and allowing them to play a major role in the planning and decision making of the project. This has demonstrated clearly to the community that their knowledge, concerns and ideas are taken seriously, strengthening their trust in the participatory process. At the same time, however, this has led to diffusion of the project objectives with a lack of clarity on priorities and a gradual shift in preference of interest towards activities of immediate benefits rather than to broader, long-term solutions to the problems.
Besides fostering uncertainty, this emphasis on the local community has resulted in a lack of understanding, involvement and commitment from other stakeholders such as government institutions and mangrove cutters and licensees. This imbalance between bottom-up and top-down focus is characteristic of the general lack of mutual trust between local community-based organizations and government officials in Kenya. A detailed land use plan for the community mangrove forest area at Tsunza has been developed through an intensive participatory consultation process involving a mapping exercise of the village and its environment by the community. Similar comparable environmental land use maps and management plans were prepared with the target communities during the Resource Inventory survey conducted during this period. The implementation of such community based management and development plans proves to be a learning process that requires patience and flexibility. Placing the local community in a central position in decision making and planning can have its own drawbacks, but this may prove the most sustainable strategy for the long term, as it builds strong local commitment.

Its ultimate goal is a large-scale restoration of the mangrove and coral reef ecosystems in the southern coastal regions of Hainan, Guangxi, Fujian and Guangdong. This southern zone has seen increasing degradation as a result of exploitative activities, and the Chinese government is interested in working to restore its biodiversity and implementing institutional strategies for long-term management and sustainability.Mining & Resource Extraction Due to the plundering excavation and inefficient utilization of the mangrove and coral reef ecosystems during the last two decades, 80 per cent of the coral reefs along the coast of Hainan island have been destroyed. Some species of coral reefs have disappeared entirely. The rapid degeneration of mangroves and coral reefs has caused severe destruction to marine biodiversity and marine resources and deterioration of the overall ecological environment. It has reduced the capacity for marine disasters prevention and threatened the livelihood, safety and property of the people. Moreover, the deterioration will obviously hinder the rapid development of coastal industries like agriculture, fishing and marine industries. – The long term objective of this project is to establish a preventive belt with mangrove and coral reef along the coast of southern China and construct a highly productive mangrove and coral reef eco-system to promote the development aquiculture and sustainable utilisation of marine resources, thus improve the quality of daily life of the local people and environment around them, and guarantee sustainable development of the regional economy.
– Within the framework of integrated coastal zone management, establish an integrated management regime for sustainable development of the mangrove and coral reef ecosystems at the national, provincial (autonomous region) and municipal (county) levels that would carry out legal management of the mangrove and coral reef ecosystems;
– Enhance the capability of protection, restoration, reconstruction, afforestation and management of the mangrove and coral reef ecosystems in China. Restore, re-establish and plant 20,000 ha. of mangrove trees in the tideland suitable for afforestation along the coast of south China;
– Make a thorough investigation of the distribution of the mangrove in the Chinese coastline, establish coral reef reserves and special protected areas, restore the productivity of the coral reef areas by increasing 50 percent of the fish stock in the reserves and the special protected areas.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
As with most any mangrove or coral reef restoration project, local inhabitants of the region(s) to be affected by the restoration are primary stakeholders. They are expected to benefit economically from a more vibrant ecosystem that more readily yields valuable natural resources. The international community of scientists is also a stakeholder in this project. Through consultation and collaboration with Chinese researchers/practitioners, these international professionals are expected to deepen their store of knowledge and practical experience with this type of restoration. Furthermore, a mangrove resources bank and mangrove ecosystem information system will be compiled during this project and will thus be available to researchers and practitioners for subsequent projects. Chinese professionals will, in turn, benefit from the project, as they are to receive technical training and experience throughout the investigation and management phases of the project.

Description of Project Activities: - Make a thorough investigation on the present status of the mangrove and coral reef ecosystems in China. This will include a study of the biological species, the geographical elements and their distribution;
 - Set up technical experiment stations in Hainan and Guangxi to study and develop the technology in diversified cultivation, transplant, seedlings and rapid growth of mangroves and coral reefs, and provide technical support to the development of mangrove and coral reef ecosystems; 
 - Establish demonstration areas for conservation, restoration and reconstruction of the mangrove ecosystem: select representative river estuaries, harbors, island groups, wide shores, tidal zone and bare tideland with different niches in Guangxi and Hainan to take various technological measures and methods of management to plant a total area of 250 hectares of demonstration forest; 
 - Establish five tree nurseries with a total area of 10 hectares; 
 - Restore 20,000 hectares of secondary mangrove forests ( tentatively planned 7,000 hectares in Hainan, 7,000 hectares in Guangxi, 5,000 hectares in Guangdong and 1,000 hectares in Fujian); 
 - Develop the sustainable utilization products of the resources of the mangrove and coral reef ecosystems, develop ecological cultivation and fishery resources cultivation, promote eco-tourism, utilize tannic acid attracted from mangrove trees, and develop marine biological medicine and health materials. 
Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: A shortage of funds and the public's poor awareness and participation are the key obstacles to the implementation of this project.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: The mangrove areas established according to this project will not only provide various functions badly needed by the coastal people, e.g., storm shelter, shore erosion prevention and sewage purification, but can also provided sites for education and recreation. Assuming US$ 500/hectare/year as the lowest economic value of the products and services provided from the mangrove ecosystem, an area of 20,000 hectares can bring local residents US$ 10 million per year; if it is US$ 1,000/hectare/year for the average economic value of the same area, then the benefit can be US$ 20 million per year. This analysis doesn't consider the value of the land and aquatic environment benefit of the mangroves. After completion of the project, the existing coral reef resources in the Chinese sea area can be conserved, the destroyed part can be recovered gradually, the fishing yields along the Chinese coral reef areas and the areas around them can double or more. Therefore, China will make its greater contribution to the protection of the biodiversity in the world.
– Establish committees or corresponding agencies for the management and conservation of the mangrove and coral reef ecosystems at national, provincial and municipal levels
– Formulate relevant laws, regulations and policies for conservation of the mangrove and coral reef ecosystems "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/vietnam-mangrove-restoration-in-can-gio-ho-chi-minh-city/	Vietnam: Mangrove Restoration in Can Gio (Ho Chi Minh City)	Vietnam	1978-01-18	1997-01-18	"Can Gio Mangroves cover an area of about 38,750 ha and occupy 54,2% of the total natural land of the district. In the second Indochina war, the dense mangroves were severely destroyed by bombs and herbicides sprayed. Many animals were killed or migrated to other areas.Severe erosion was observed in the dead mangrove areas and along the river banks. A large area of bare land has turned into acid sulfate soil.Rehabilitation is a joint effort of Ho Chi Minh City’s people. An extensive reforestation programme was undertaken after the war (1978). Now the majority of the sprayed area is covered by replanted and regenerated mangrove vegetation. The rehabilitation has resulted in the increase of biodiversity in terms of flora, plant communities, plankton, benthos, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. It has also led to positive changes in the physio-chemical properties of the soil and water. Environmental improvement has been observed in the rapid accretion of mud flats along the river banks and the mitigation of erosion and salt intrusion, as well as pollution.Forest management activities and forest allocation for local dwellers have been implemented in recent years to bring about an improvement in ecosystem resource management and successful conservation.The results gained from the restoration and conservation work have changed the landscape and the life of local dwellers in a good direction. Can Gio Mangrove Forests have just been recognized by UNESCO/MAB as the Mangrove Biosphere Reserve.Deforestation During the Vietnam War, mangrove forests in Can Gio were one of the resistance bases in the Southeast of Vietnam. Consequently, they were extensively damaged by bombs and herbicides such as áâ‚¬Å“agent orange,áâ‚¬Â as well as white agent and blue agent. From 1966 to 1970, with the launching of Operation Ranch Hand, the US Air Force sprayed 1,017,515 gallons of herbicides and defoliants (Ross, 1975), destroying the mangrove area in Can Gio. Of the 291 000 ha of total mangrove area in southern Viet Nam, 105 000 ha, or 36 percent, were sprayed one or more times.
Heavy defoliation has not only exterminated the vegetation but also destroyed the heterotrophic elements and changed the whole ecosystem. (Hong & San, 1993). A number of terrestrial animals and birds were killed, although some migrated to safe areas. It was found that for a few years after the defoliation, fish, crustaceans and mollusks benefited from the abundant food created by the decomposition of fallen mangroves and other organic matter. However, their numbers decreased again within three years (Hong & Tri, 1986). Some species such as crocodiles and tigers became extinct, while monkeys, lizards and birds, which used to be found in great numbers in the mangroves, also decreased gradually after the war.
Without the protection that mangroves offer against tides, waves and water currents, severe coastal and riverbank erosion occurred. Comparison of sprayed areas in 1958 and 1989 has shown that the percentage of water surface further increased to 31.2% (Nam et. al., 1992). Forest soil was chemically changed because of the loss of protective vegetation cover, with lower pH from insufficient freshwater in the dry season and higher salinity because of increased evaporation. From 1917 all mangrove forests were periodically exploited by the Water – Forestry Bureau of the French Colonial Government. In 1929, the French colonists enacted a measure to conserve the forbidden mangrove forests in Quang Xuyen and Can Gio Districts (Nam & Quy, 1999). The favorable natural conditions and the adequate management brought about the strong development of mangroves. The dominant species was 12-15m in height and 20-30 cm in diameter on average.
Vu Van Cuong (1964) divided the mangrove vegetation in this area into two groups as follows:
Salty water community group —
– The pioneer community of Sonneratia alba and Avicennia alba grew on the new mud flat of estuaries. The pioneer population of Avicennia alba developed along the river banks.
– The community of Rhizophora apiculata and Sonneratia alba (50% and 20% respectively) was formed on the mud flat that has become stable thanks to the pioneer community or population. The mangrove tree was 8-10m in height. In the community, Xylocarpus granatum, Kandelia candel, Derris trifoliata and Aegiceras corniculatum could be found as well.
– X. granatum and R.apiculata community was established on the land inundated at the level of 2-2.5 m. R. apiculata was 15-18m in height. Other species seen were Ceriops tagal, A.alba and X. granatum. This is a commonly found community in the mangrove areas.
– The community of R. apiculata and Ceriops tagal was distributed on the mud flats flooded by tides at the level of 2.5-3m. R. apiculata was dominant here with the height of over 10m. A. officinalis, X. granatum, X. moluccensis and C. decandra were also observed in this community.
– On the mud flat inundated by tides at the level of 2.5-3.0m was Avicennia officinalis and Ceriops decandra. Other species found comprised X.moluccensis, C.tagal and Lumnitzera littoralis.
– The community of Excoecaria agalocha and Phoenix paludosa was observed on the land only flooded by high tides (3.3-4.0 m). Additionally, X.moluccensis, C.tagal, Acrostichum aureum, Heritiera littoralis and Flagellaria indica were present.
Brackish water community group —
The group was distributed along the riverbanks of brackish water areas in the north of Can Gio District and along Dong Nai Estuary. There were 4 communities classified as follows:
– In the areas inundated by 1-1.5m high tides, the pioneer species found was Sonneratia caseolaris 8-10m in height.
– In the areas flooded by tides 1.5-2 m in height, the community of Cryptocoryne ciliata and Acanthus ebracteatus was formed with other species namely Nypa fruticans, Cyperus malaccensis and Derris heterophylla.
– In the areas flooded by tides at the level of 2-3m was the community of Annona reticulata and Flagellaria indica. Other species included Amoora acuculata, Barringtonia acutangula and Gardenia lucida. The mangrove trees were 6-8 m tall.
– In the areas inundated by 3-4m high tides, there was a community of Melastoma polyanthum and Dalbergia candenatensis formed with other species of Pandanus tectorius, Glochidion littorale, Hibiscus tiliaceus, Thespesia populnea, Clerodendron inerme and Pluchea indica.
There were no statistic data on animals in Can Gio. Yet the old inhabitants said that before the August revolution, a lot of terrestrial animals had lived in the mangroves such as deer, monkeys, sambars, pythons, varans, tigers, etc. Sometimes, crocodiles could be found in Dong Tranh and Soai Rap Rivers. The names of some channels proved the presence of these animals such as: Crocodile channel, wild boar channel, wolf channel … (Hong (ed.), 1997) – to restore the mangrove ecosystem previously destroyed by herbicides;
– to stabilize the land and restrict erosion;
– to contribute to the improvement of the environment by reducing the pollution caused by industrial waste and smoke discharge;
– to create habitats for terrestrial animals and provide nursery breeding grounds for aquatic resources.
– to create employment and raise the income of foresters and fisherfolk through silviculture and aquaculture activities, so improving the standard of living of local inhabitants;
– to supply part of the demand for fuelwood and poles.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.

Description of Project Activities: From 1978 to 1997, 20,638 ha of mangroves in Can Gio were under reforestation (Tuan,1998). The main species planted were the fast-growing Rhizophora apiculata (the main economic species) and other species such as Nypa friticans, Ceriops tagal and Rhizophora mucronata. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: By 1996, nearly 35 000 ha of mangrove forest had been replanted in Can Gio; of these, about 20 000 ha are now growing well. 

Previously, the coastal area and riverbanks of Can Gio suffered from extensive erosion when the northeast monsoons blew. After certain years of rehabilitation, mud flats have been formed along the riverbanks and subject to erosion caused by wave and tide actions. At the beginning of November 1997, an unusual storm hit the coastal zone of Southern Vietnam caused a serious damage to many coastal provinces. Yet, the mangrove belt in Can Gio helped a lot in mitigating the loss resulting from the storm.

The rehabilitation of mangrove forests has brought about certain changes in the physical and chemical properties of soil in the area. The substrate has been gradually transformed into loam and the pH value subsequently increased, indicating the reduction in soil acidity.

Due to the development of mangrove pioneer species such as Avicennia alba and Sonneratia ovata, erosion at riverbanks has been reduced; the accretions have developed strongly, creating large tidal sandy mud flats for blood ark-shell and clam farming.

Mangrove rehabilitation combined with water regulation of Tri An and Dau Tieng reservoirs has contributed to reducing salt intrusion in the agricultural production areas of Can Gio and neighboring districts both in the rainy and dry seasons.

The rehabilitation of mangroves at Can Gio has resulted in a dramatic increase in biodiversity, and the site is recognized at present as a Mangrove Biosphere Reserve. The following is a detailed list of the natural resources that have been restored at Can Gio.

Flora -- Compared to the flora investigated by Cuong (1964) before the warring herbicide spraying, the natural mangrove flora now is similar, but the individual number and dispersion is not the same. Our investigation has listed 72 flora species, 30 of which are true mangroves and 42 associate mangrove species.

Besides the mangrove flora, 95 species belonging to 42 families of inland plants dispersed by humans and animals have been found. These species form the diverse communities on different biotopes.

Vegetation -- Today, the mangroves in Can Gio are more diverse in community structure compared to those before the wars. An explanation for this is that in Can Gio Mangroves, valuable species mixed with naturally regenerated ones have been rehabilitated. Some are found naturally regenerating on abandoned shrimp ponds. Below is some main communities 

Communities in areas of high salt concentrations:

1. The pioneer community of Sonneratia alba - Avicennia alba can be found on the coastal and estuarine newly accreted lands daily flooded by tides. The salinity here is high. 
2. The pioneer population of A. alba is present on the newly formed mud flats along the rivers and creeks. 
3. Rhizophora apiculata and Avicennia alba community is seen between the replanted R. apiculata and the population of A. alba naturally regenerating on deep muddy soil. 
4. R. apiculata and A.officinalis community is distributed on firm mud flats flooded by normal high tides. These two species are found naturally regenerating in groups. 
5. The community of R. apiculata - Lumnitzera racemosa and Ceriops decandra is formed on firm mud lands flooded by spring tides. Only R. apiculata was planted between 1981 and 1985 and later on chopped down, leaving behind bare areas and naturally regenerated shrubs. 
6. The community of R.mucronata - Phoenix paludosa and Lumnitzera racemosa grows on firm mud flats flooded by spring tide. Phoenix was burnt to spare land for Rhizophora planting. After that, the species vigorously regenerate from stumps in rainy season. 
7. The community of Ceriops tagal - C. decandra can be seen on sandy mud flats flooded by spring tides. Dominant species is C. tagal. R. apiculata and L. racemosa are sparsely distributed. 
8. The community of Phoenix paludosa and Acrostichum aureum is on firm sandy clay flats only flooded by spring tides. The associate species are L.racemosa, Excoecaria agallocha and Pluchea indica. 
9. The population of Excoecaria agallocha is formed on the firm sandy/loam flats. 
10. Avicennia lanata population regenerates on the high land of sandy clay or on the substrate of abandoned salt pans. 
11. On waste lands of firm sandy clay or former salt pans and shrimp ponds is the population of Sesuvium portulacastrum.

Brackish water communities:

In general, brackish water communities at present are not very much different from those found prior to the wars. Some main communities are:

 -  Pioneer community of Sonneratia caseolaris - Avicennia alba 
 -  Pure Nypa fruticans population 
 -  Nypa fruticans - Acanthus ilicifolius - Cryptocorine ciliata community 
 -  Sonneratia caseolaris -Nypa fruticans community 
 -  Annona reticulata - Flagellaria indica community

Plankton -- The analysis of 52 water samples of plankton from different points in the directions of north-south and east-west in Can Gio by Viet (1993) has given the following results. There were 63 phytoplankton species and 19 zooplankton species found. Zooplankton increased considerably in the samples collected in June 1993 (100,000-1,000,000 cells/mÁ‚Â³) in comparison with that in June, 1990 (67,000-6,025,000 cells/mÁ‚Â³).

Benthos -- Mangrove rehabilitation has changed the soil's properties thanks to the sediments formed by litter fall with the help of large quantities of fine and fibrous root matter. The mud has the highest concentrations of organic carbon and nitrogen (Alongi & Sasekumar, 1992). This has directly influenced the distribution of benthos. On the other hand, benthos play an important role in the decomposition of litter fall. Through our preliminary surveys, 115 species of invertebrate macro-benthos have been listed. Polychaeta has 34 species of 19 families; Mollusca comprises Gastropoda class with 18 species belonging to 12 families and Bivalve class with 11 species of 8 families. In Crustacea class, 27 species belonging to 9 families of Macrura and 25 species in 5 families of Brachyura have been found. (Anon, 1998)

Fish -- Fish use mangrove waters as nursery grounds, permanent habitats or breeding grounds (Aksornkoae, 1993). 134 species belonging to 40 families have been found, the majority of them are true estuarine species and the remaining are eurythermal and euryhaline fishes. Most species live in shallow waters and often enter estuaries for feeding (Tang, 1984; Mien et al., 1992). Recently, Pangasius polyuranodon and Mugil affinis have developed rapidly, especially in the rivers with abundant Avicennia alba and A. officinalis; Lates calcarifer concentrate in shrimp ponds. Priophthalmus schloserri used to be rare but have now become rather common, particularly at the mud flats near salty water river mouths.

Amphibians -- Preliminary surveys show that there are 9 species belonging to the 4 amphibian families. The tree frogs (Racophous leucomystax) are commonly found. Their loud croaks can often be heard in the forests. They breed in the rainy season - a foamy secretion is left on the trees as a result of mass copulation. Cricket frog (Rana limnocharis) is mainly seen not only in the rice fields but in the brackish water mangroves as well. The common toad (Bufo melanostictus) is often seen in guardhouses where there are a lot of mosquitoes.

Reptiles -- Of the 30 species of 13 families found in Can Gio, 8 species belong to the family Colubridae and 3 belong to Cheloniidae, the remaining is only found in the large rivers and sea shore. The King cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) is distributed throughout the natural and replanted forests, while Naja naja is widely distributed in the villager gardens. A number of aquatic snakes such as Achrochordus javanicus, Lapenius hardwickii and marine turtles as Chelonia mydas, Leidochelys olivacea are only caught in the sea shore by fishing nets. In 1983, some workers at the enterprise shot a crocodile, but since then no other crocodiles have appeared. Only 30 crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) have been reared at the Can Gio Forestry Park. Since the 1990s, thanks to the effective protection of forests, many birds have come and consequently a number of reptiles eating bird eggs or young birds such as varans, boas, and snakes have increased.

Birds -- From 1975 to 1980, birds were very rare in Can Gio Mangrove areas, especially on the high land only flooded at high tide as birds' dung was rarely seen on the ground or near tree bases. Local people said only some river kingfishers were occasionally found perching on Avicennia branches or several little egrets (Egretta garzetta) or lesser sand plovers were seen searching for food on the mud flats far from villages. Since the 1980s, more and more birds have come back to the area. Besides waterfowls, many flocks of migratory birds from the North such as Charadrius alexandrius, Pluvialis squatarola, Pluvialis fulva and especially Tringa glareola, T. erythropus, Himantropus himantropus have been seen. Some water bird species make their nests from April to the next February in Phoenix padulosa stumps and Avicennia trees far from residential areas namely Egretta garzetta, Buteroides striatus, Bubuleus ibis. Along the mud flats of the rivers and creeks, which are periodically inundated, a number of wader species can be seen either feeding or roosting on the banks (Hussain et al., 1994). About 130 species of 44 families are known to occur in Can Gio. Of these, 51 species are waterfowls, including 21 migratory species. The rest is common in the delta and is seen in the different habitats (Dat, 1997). Birds play an important role in the ecosystem, contributing actively to the enrichment of the source of food in mangrove areas and making the soil fertile.

Mammals -- 19 mammal species belonging 13 families and 5 species of chiropterans have been recorded (Dat, 1997). Among the terrestrial mammals, after mangrove restoration, the species with the most numerous individuals is macaques (Macaca facicularis), which lives in troops of 30 to 40 along the rivers and canals. Since 1992 they have multiplied very fast particularly in the forestry park. Everyday at the ebb tide, they often go to the flats to catch small crabs and mud skippers. Recently they have been fed by the forestry park's staff and tourists and hence have become more and more used to meeting people. The rodents develop strongly particularly the species in Muridae due to the increase of human population. Groups of wild boar (Sus serofa) are rather abundant in the P. paludosa patches.

Sometimes local people see fishing cat (Felis viverrinus) on the natural Avicennia forests. This species is well adapted to the tidal areas and feeds on fish, birds, bandicoot, oysters and other small animals (Hussain et al., 1994).

Generally speaking, the diversity of fauna within mangroves is high due to favorable food resources and a wide range of microhabitats - 6 types of microhabitats in mangrove forests recorded by Chapman (1975) as soil surface, soil interior, tide pools, small canals, fallen logs and tree canopy have been seen in Can Gio forests. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The reforestation in Can Gio was mainly done by youngsters and schoolchildren. Consequently, the technical aspects of reforestation were neglected and the survival rate was low. In the first years of the R. apiculata plantation, because of the lack of experience, the planting density was too high. Of the 29 583 ha of R. apiculata planted in Can Gio from 1978 to 1989, only 18 125 ha were covered with mangroves at the beginning of 1990.

Through the 1980s, the success rate of the rehabilitation was further limited by inadequate management. A Forestry Enterprise made up of a small group of forestry workers, with insufficient means of transport and communication, was responsible for the protection of a vast area. Local inhabitants and nearby coastal dwellers, under economic stress, destroyed newly replanted mangroves through overharvesting for fuelwood and conversion to shrimp ponds.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: At the beginning of 2000, the Can Gio mangroves were designated for inclusion in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's World Network of Biosphere Reserves. From 1998 to 2001, ecotourism in Can Gio has developed rapidly. The troops of macaques, reared crocodiles and other wild mammals in the protected Can Gio Forestry Park have attracted many tourists. This development in ecotourism has contributed favorably to the socio-economic improvement of the local community.

The mangrove restoration has also afforded good opportunities in biological research and conservation education. Recently, the Action for Mangrove Reforestation - Japan (ACTMANG) has supported Ho Chi Minh City to construct a model of Human Ecology Park in Can Gio Mangroves for Vietnamese and foreign students.
In May 1991, the government approved a project for the environmental protection of the forests of Ho Chi Minh City, and the People’s Committee invested funds and proper equipment to protect the forests. The Forestry Enterprise was converted into the Management Board of the City’s Environmentally Protected Forests (MBCEPF), personnel was increased and the city put into practice a policy of land and forest allocation to households. As a result, the destruction of forests markedly decreased.
Activities in the forest are now monitored and recorded. The main guard force includes workers from MBCEPF, workers from the agroforestry enterprises, employees of the Forestry Agency and households allocated forests to protect under 30-year contracts with MBCEPF. To date, 10 850 ha have been allocated to 208 household guards. The guards are given monthly salaries, 35 percent of the forest produce from thinnings, an allocation of 3 to 5 ha per household for aquaculture or salt ponds, assistance with difficulties and rewards for good protection of the forests. Other benefits to households include money to build houses on allocated land, boats for forest protection, loans for authorized fisheries production, and technical help through short training courses on thinning, reforestation and shrimp farming.

https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/india-mangrove-restoration-in-palk-bay-tamil-nadu/	India: Mangrove Restoration in Palk Bay, Tamil Nadu	India	2005	2010	"The MANGREEN project intends to be a model for the community-based ecological restoration of mangroves through the application of scientific knowledge along with socio-economic development.In September 2005, the project was initiated in two villages: Keezhathottam and Velivayal located at Agni estuary in the northern Palk Bay, where the natural and artificial regeneration sites have been successfully established after a careful study on the soil quality, suitable species composition, availability of natural recruitment, land elevation, distance from the water source, grazing effect and land-use. Convincing the fishing community was one of the first tasks, followed by official permission and support.We have now planted more than 10, 000 mangrove seedlings in the selected sites of artificial regeneration, where there is little opportunity for natural recruitment, and 3,850 saplings are under constant observation in the nurseries. Local villagers have been recruited for the establishment of Ecological Mangrove Restoration (EMR) sites that include excavation and cleaning of water channels, fencing, seed collection, plantation and maintenance.With reforestation underway, creating community awareness and facilitating community development have been other constant aspects of the project. A variety of lectures in local schools, as well as street plays, eco-clubs, professional training, and village self-help groups have been implemented in order to raise awareness about the projects along the entire Tamil Nadu coast. The villagers generally support the project as they have learned about the importance of healthy mangroves and fisheries.Agriculture & Livestock, Fisheries & Aquaculture, Mining & Resource Extraction The coastline of Tamil Nadu in southern India was hit severely by the waves of the 2004 Sumatra Tsunami. Long before the Tsunami, however, the lives of local people at Palk Bay had already been affected by the destruction of the mangroves. As in many places, mangroves have been exploited for thousands of years all over India. Local uses include fuel wood, fisheries, honey production and the use of Nypa leaves for roofing materials. In modern times large areas of land have been reclaimed for agricultural purposes and urban development. Mangroves are also heavily exploited for the grazing of cattle. In the supralittoral zone, salt collection is also an important activity. Traditional mariculture has a long history of pond construction for shrimp cultivation, and heavy trawler operations by shrimp farmers have degraded the ecosystem. Linked to these issues, and to increasing population pressure, pollution from urban and agricultural runoff is an increasing threat. The need for mangrove restoration and proper management in Tamil Nadu results at least from the fact that only during the last century 40% of the mangrove area of this federal state has been lost. Keezhathottam (10° 17`n.L.; 79° 21` e.L.) is situated at the lower course and the estuary of the
Agni river in south eastern Tamil Nadu. It immediately lies at the coast of the Palk Bay, which belongs
to the Indian Ocean.
The village lies within the tropical zone of the east coasts. The summers are very hot and arid,
while the winters are temperate and humid, due to the impact of the north- east monsoon from October
to February. There is no influence of south- west monsoon, because of the insulating effect of the West
Ghates, which range from south to north India and geographically divide the eastern from the western part. The average annual temperature is higher than 27.5°C and the rainfall is about 650-800mm/a. The soil consists of Pleistocene and recent sediments and is alluvial and tidal overlaid.
The mangrove forest in Keezhathottam surely hasn’t been monospecious like it is today (the forest solely consists of Avicennia marina trees). This recent condition is caused by human activities and the direct influence of them on abiotic and biotic factors, e.g. dam and dike construction for aquaculture and the following change of soil structure and water- holding capacity etc. which lead to parching and crusting of the soils in Keezhathottam. – To carry out marine ecological studies on the Palk Bay coastal region.
– To document the marine flora and fauna, their current status and human impacts on the Palk Bay coastal environment.
– To restore and manage patchy mangroves of the Palk Bay region through community based conservation programmes.
– To save the stranded marine mammals by forming a communication network with the volunteers of coastal villages.
– To establish an environmental information centre that will give data about the local environmental issues of Palk Bay.
– To study the socio-economic status of fisher folks of Palk Bay.
– To create awareness among the fisher folk community about the importance of protecting the Palk Bay region and its endangered species through street plays and cultural programmes.
– To establish education and community development centers in coastal villages
– To improve the educational and economic status of fisher folks.
– To form eco-clubs in the schools of Palk Bay region to carry out school level environmental awareness programmes.
– To establish a plant nursery to supply seedlings of endemic plants to eco-clubs.
– To organize field trips for students to encourage their interest and knowledge on conservation.
– To cooperate with other educational, research and social organizations in conservation and community development.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The villagers of Keezhathottam and the surrounding area

Description of Project Activities: We established a protected site on the northern side of the Agni estuary. The restoration site was split into 5 parts in order to facilitate a step-by-step extension of the project area. The area is protected by fences and has three artificial fish bone canals. After establishing the site, one of the project's first tasks was to address the Tamil fishermen in order to gain their support for our effort to create protected mangrove sites. With the support of the fisherman, and permission from the government, a total of 11,000 seeds of Avicennia sp. and Rhizophora sp. were initially sown. An annotated list of project activities follows:

 - Desiltation of canals
Without cleaning the natural and artificial waterways, the replanted and wild mangrove seedlings would be under stress. Therfore in August 2005 one of the first steps of OMCAR was to recruite labourers in the nearby villages to help clear debris from the channels.

 - Fencing
MANGREEN site 1 was encircled with wooden fences to prevent further cattle grazing. A team of local villagers was formed to carry out fence construction. Locally available eucalyptus woods were used for the fences.

 - Nursery construction
A site near the coastal mangrove stretch in Keezhathottam was selected for nursery construction, which is close to a tidal creek. The square shaped nursery has 15 sunken nursery beds with a shadow of coconut thatches to prevent mortality and desertification by the sun.

 - Seed collection and plantation
4000 propagules of Rhizophora were collected from Pitchavaram mangrove forest through the forest department. 900 propagules were planted in the nursery and the remaining 3100 propagules were directly sowed into the desilted fish bone canals in the protected site.

 - Canal maintenance work
The siltation of few fishbone canals and formations of dense debris of washed ashore sea grasses like Cymodocea sp. and Syringodium isoetifolium were removed from all canals to protect the newly planted propagules.

 - Avicennia Plantation
6000 seeds of Avicennia marina were collected and planted in mangreen site 1 the fish bone canals of southern side of Agni Estuary.

 - Avicennia marina nursery bed preparation
Seeds were collected from southwestern side of Muthupet mangroves. 700 pockets of A. marina (2 seeds/pocket) were prepared in the nursery. A small fencing with fishing nets supported by wooden poles was arranged for protection.

 - Mangrove vegetation study in plots Nr. 4 and 5
This study was carried out in an islet that is located in the western side of mangrove swamp near Keezhathottam. The continuous monitoring of these plots will be helpful to know the changes in the mangrove community structure.

 - Fencing in MANGREEN Site 2
Local villagers were selected for fencing work. This fence covers the Plot.1 of AMANGREEN site 2, and will be used as evidence of the benefits of the restoration programme by the growth of shoreline mangroves through the prevention of cattle grazing.

 - Avicennia seed collections and sowing
Seeds were collected from Keezhathottam mangroves and were segregated and directly planted inside MANGREEN site 1 and 2. The remaining seeds were planted along the opposite Agni river shore. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: The mere plantation consists of 3 fishbone canals, each with a central main canal, on which 6 support canals converge. To each canal system there were given letters in ascending order seawards (A,B,C). The support canals were given numbers from 1 to 6, and the main canals were given number 7.

The seedlings were monitored for their survival and growth in the last week of October 2005 and December 2005. The total number of both, Avicennia sp., and Rhizophora sp., seedlings was ascertained in each canal, as well as the number of diseased and damaged plants. After that the measurement on the individual plants took place.

***Avicennia sp.,    ***
Regarding the survival of Avicennia seedlings in fish bone canals, canal C had lost 816 seedlings, canal A had lost 369 and canal B had lost 228 seedlings during the two month period. The reason is mainly due to heavy monsoon flooding in Tamil Nadu that led to the continuous submergence of seedlings by estuarine water and dense algal coverage. The algal deposition blocked photosynthesis and caused the weakening of seedlings.

In October 2005 the maximum average height was recorded from canal B1 (52.6cm), maximum average number of leaves from A6 (68.6), maximum average of internode length from B2 (13.7cm), maximum average leaf length from B1 (18.5cm), maximum average leaf breadth from B2 (2.8cm) and maximum average number of diseased/damaged leaves from A6 (17.4)

In the second study, maximum average height was recorded from the same canal B1 (59.1cm), maximum average number of leaves from A6 (99.8), maximum average of internode length from A4 (7.1cm), maximum average leaf length from C7 (16.1cm), maximum average leaf breadth from B6 (2.6cm) and maximum average number of diseased/damaged leaves form C6 (5.4). So, for Avicennia sp., seedlings, plant height, internode length, leaf length, leaf breadth were significantly increased. Average of diseased/damaged leaves was reduced.

***Rhizophora sp.,    ***
Canal A had lost 62 propagules, canal B had lost 65 propagules and canal C had lost 85 propagules in two months period. Unlike Avicennia seedlings the Rhizophora seedlings were not affected by algal coverage, but their growth and survival were dependant upon the viability and time of transportation of propagules during plantation. The fresh propagules collected from Keezhathottam area showed 100% success as they were immediately planted, but the second batch of propagules collected from Pitchavaram by the forest department showed 40% mortality.

In October 2005, the maximum average height was observed from Canal A7 as 37cm, maximum average number of leaves was recorded from canal B7 as 26, maximum average internode length was noticed from canal B7 as 4.2cm, maximum leaf length (9.2cm) and leaf breadth (4.1cm) was also recorded form the same canal. Maximum number of diseased/damaged leaves was recorded form B5 (2.15)

In December 2005, the maximum average height was recorded at canal C6 (29.9cm), maximum average number of leaves at B7 (10.4), maximum internode length at C6 (14.8cm), maximum leave length at A7 (7.6cm), maximum leaf breadth at B7 (4.1cm) and maximum average number of diseased/damaged leaves at B1 (3.8).

So, the average of plant height, internode length, and leaf length were shown positive correlation and total number of leaves was reduced while diseased/damaged leaves were increased in two months period in Rhizophora sp., seedlings. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: The plots one to three are highly exposed to cattle grazing. This leads to a stunted growth of trees and keeps them in a shrubby form. Although plot 1 and 5 both show a high grade of small trees, this has different reasons. In plot five many seedlings occur, whereas in plot 1 a big part of small trees is older, but affected by grazing and therefore shows stunted growth. For making more clear statements about the actual impact of grazing in the Keezhathottam mangroves, one shall make a survey on the age distribution of vegetation in all plots.

The distribution of height groups shows the formation of clusters, so that in most cases trees of the same height closely stand together. This could be a consequence of natural rejuvenation of mangroves, as mangrove seedlings need light for their establishment and therefore are hardly found in the under the shadow of mangrove trees, but at the fringe. But it could also be a consequence of intensive cattle grazing, by whom the outer trees of the clusters are affected and at the same time protect the inner standing trees.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: When the mangroves disappeared in Tamil Nadu, so too did the stocks of edible fish on which the coastal population lives--or else they were severely depleted. For the local population, the reafforestation of the mangroves and the re-creation of a functioning ecosystem are linked to the hope of long-term coastal protection and securing one of their major food sources.
Fish bone canals are considered one effective model for mangrove restoration in the Tamil Nadu region. But, the long-term sustainability of this method is still in question, as the canals will be blocked by their own mangroves, which will stop tidal flushing to rest of the canals. So, this study will help to compare the suitability of fish bone canals, through the periodic documentation. Social and economic factors are often decisive for the long-term success of a rehabilitation project. Therefore, a serious attempt was made to address some of the pressing issues facing villagers in and around Keezhathottam and to develop thoughtful outreach programs that would invest them in the project and ultimately maximize the efficacy of the restoration. The following are some of the programs in which the villagers have been involved.
***Eco Clubs*** Eco-clubs of 6th, 7th and 8th grade students were formed in these schools. The eco-club members are actively involved in planting trees and maintaining hygiene in drinking water and classrooms. OMCAR distributed seedlings of endemic trees with bamboo fences to the coastal schools, and eco-club members planted the seedlings inside the school.
***Field Trip with Schools*** Batch school students were organized for an education field trip to the Muthupet mangrovesThe team started its boat journey in the morning from Muthupet to the Mullipallam lagoon. The students were interested to see the mangroves, artificial plantation of Rhizophora apiculata, birds, canal fishing and lagoon islets. The team returned to Muthupet in the evening with great enthusiasm for mangroves.
***Public street plays*** The villages closely situated to our mangrove sites were selected for a public street play programme. The plays last two hours and talk about a normal day in the life of a fishermen. Messages on conservation were added throughout the program about the benefits of mangroves, migratory birds, eco-tourism, and mangrove-supported fishery. Soil erosion, personal hygiene, gender equality, child-hood marriage, and the MANGREEN project were also discussed.
***Mangreen tailoring unit*** OMCAR has started a tailor training programme for village woman. Our field office was used as a training center and a professional from the nearby town taught them with two machines. This offers them a possibility to learn a new skill in their own village.
***Coir making*** The coir unit is using a simple machine to make a strong rope out of the dry fibers of coconuts. We provided the machines in different phases to the village women and arranged for professional trainers for making the coir. This effectively gives an alternative job and self-confidence to a skilled rural woman and improves the daily income for her family.
***Fishermen Self help group*** A group of 16 fishermen from Keezhathottam village was organized by OMCAR to start a self-help group. They met local bank and government administrative officers to start a group savings account. Each member of this group agreed to save a part of his earnings to the group account, which will be used for emergency or credit to one among them. "
https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/usa-california-restoration-of-batiquitos-lagoon-carlsbad/	USA: California: Restoration of Batiquitos Lagoon (Carlsbad)	United States of America	1994-03-17	1996-12-17	"Batiquitos Lagoon is a coastal lagoon located in the southern part of California just 35 miles (56.3 km) north of San Diego city. During the 20th century many transportation routes had been built across the mouth of the Batiquitos Lagoon, cutting the lagoon off from the ocean. This included three transportation corridors (a railroad bridge, the Pacific Coast Highway, and Interstate 5) that were constructed across the lagoon. These corridors constricted the tidal flow of water in and out of the lagoon. Additionally, agriculture and urban development in the watershed area caused a significant influx of fine sediment into the lagoon. Heavy agricultural and residential land uses in the 30-square-mile (77.6 kmÁ‚Â²) watershed were the source of significant nutrient loading from fertilizers and runoff. All these factors contributed to the degraded state of the lagoon and the closure of the tidal inlet.
With the connection to the ocean lost, the lagoon’s water became less saline and sediment began to accumulate, reducing the lagoon’s habitat value for plant and wildlife species. The interface between salt and fresh water creates an ecosystem unique to lagoons because they are both nutrient rich and sheltered from wave action. In addition, due the change in elevation from the lagoon’s water surface to the top of the lagoon’s banks there are three general habitat types; 1) upland habitat, 2) intertidal habitat, and 3) open water (listed from highest to lowest in elevation). Each habitat houses its own plant, fowl and/or fish wildlife.
The áâ‚¬Ëœupland’ plant habitat consists of; scrub, grassland, willow, riparian, un-vegetated sand flat, and saline meadow. The birds in the upland area are bullock’s oriole (Icterus bullockii), western kingbird (Tyrannus verticalis), warblers, and black-headed grosbeak (Pheucticus melanocephalus) and other large birds such as raptors. In the intertidal environment the plant life includes; salt marsh, brackish marsh, freshwater marsh, algal beds, mudflats, and salt panne. The birdlife entails both wading and shore birds, and water fowl, such as mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). áâ‚¬ËœOpen water’ habitat type is characterized more by its physical characteristics than by the plants and birds that live in it. Based on these physical characteristics, this habitat can be subdivided into three areas: 1) salt water lagoon, 2) near shore, and 3) fresh water. Some fish species that are commonly found in open water habitat are the áâ‚¬Ëœaerial fish foragers’, for whom catch fish by flying low over the water to locate their food and then diving into the water to capture it. These aerial fish foragers include; pelicans, terns, and kingfishers. The lagoon fish community supports three guilds of fish: 1) Pelagic fish (fish that live and feed primarily in the water column, such as smelts), 2) Demersal fish (fish that live and feed primarily along the bottom, such as rays) and, 3) Structured-habitat fish (fish that use underwater structures, such as rock pilings and eelgrass).
Although once a áâ‚¬Ëœtidal system’, Batiquitos Lagoon has remained largely un-tidal for the last 90 years. By the early 1980’s, the lagoon had achieved an advanced state of sediment infilling and eutrophication resulting in serious natural habitat declines. In 1997, the Port of Los Angeles et al. began the environmental restoration of Batiquitos Lagoon. Since the end of construction, the ecosystem of the lagoon has gradually changed from a confined non-tidal system with limited habitat value to fully tidal, salt water system with greater habitat value.
The major construction process involved:
– dredging sand from the central basin for use in beach replenishment and creation of tern colonies (1994-1995)
– placement of fine sediment materials dredged from the eastern basin into the central basin borrow pit and construction of the lagoon mouth jetties (1995-1996)
– capping the central basin borrow pit, containing fine sediments, with sand dredged from the western basin.
The minor construction process involved:
– remove and re-contour an access ramp in the eastern basin
– plant pickleweed (Salicornia europeae) along parts of the northern shore of the eastern basin
– remove an undesirable underwater ridge in the entrance channel of the lagoon
– weed and repair erosion damage on tern colonies and prepare colonies for the 1997 nesting season
– enhance the facing of the railroad bridge abutmentsAgriculture & Livestock, Urbanization, Transportation & Industry _

Description of Project Activities: March 1994 to December 1996 involved actual construction.  According to the 2001 Report, monitoring of the project started in 1997, and was to continue for 10 years, till 2007. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Vegetation:  As expected, total acreage of coastal salt marsh within the lagoon has increased during each monitoring year from 1997 through to 2001 (largest gain in 1999).  The primary gain in coastal salt marsh has resulted from the conversion of brackish marsh, mudflat, algal bed, and freshwater marsh.
Avian community: Batiquitos Lagoon supports a rich avian community comprised of migratory and resident species which are extremely variable in their seasonal abundance.  The numbers of individual present within the lagoon during 2001 was lower than in previous years; however, overall numbers went up a great deal as compared to post-restoration.  Due to seasonal migration patterns as factor driving avian into the lagoon, the months of January and October proved to have the greatest numbers of all monitoring years.  Additional influences over variation and numbers in the avian group was the reduction of brackish marsh conditions and the development of mudflat and coastal salt marsh communities. However, the utilization of mudflats (primary users are shorebirds) declined by 2001.  This may be contributed to predation and lack of nesting colony maintenance.
Fish: Prior to restoration, water salinities within the lagoon were low, ranging from fresh to brackish.  As a result fish species captured within the lagoon have historically (i.e. 1984) been brackish or freshwater species.  They have since been displaced by a predominantly marine system.
There were water quality improvements concerning salinity.  During 1979 to 1982, water salinities were estimated to average between 0 and 10 ppt during the winter months (nearly a freshwater lake), and during the summer months salinities averaged between 30 and 40 ppt (2 to 4 times that of sea water), and during drought years as high as 100 ppt.  During 1998 through 2001, the salinities within the lagoon remained similar to oceanic water salinities.
Pilot vegetation program: introduction of cordgrass and eelgrass was a success.
The long-term biological monitoring is being carried out by the City of Carlsbad and the Port of Lost Angeles in coordination with agencies including USFWS, CDFG, and NMFS.
The monitoring program for the lagoon will consist of quarterly, semiannual, and annual sampling activities to be conducted in years 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 following lagoon restoration (starting January 1997).
Some goals of the monitoring include:
– fulfill conditions associated with the various project approvals, and mitigation agreements
– record changes in the ecology of the lagoon environment over time
– provide timely identification of any problems with the physical, chemical, and/or biological development of the lagoon; and,
– assist in providing a technical basis for resource management, recording maintenance needs and enhancement opportunities "

Bair Island is located in the southern part of San Francisco Bay and is now owned by the State of California as the Bair Island State Ecological Reserve. Donated by the Peninsula Open Space Trust after they purchased it from a company whose housing development plans fell through, it was passed on to and is now managed by Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in Redwood City.
A geographical aspect of San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary, Bair Island is considered an ecological treasure that supports enormous biodiversity and consists of three islands; Inner, Middle, and Outer Bair. However, prior to being considered ecologically valuable, Bair Island resources had been utilized for a economical purpose through-out the last century.
Between 1946 and 1952, the Leslie Salt Company partitioned Bair Island with dirt levees for use as salt-making evaporation ponds, creating three islands separated by Smith and Corkscrew sloughs. After 1965, these salt ponds on Bair Island were abandoned by the Leslie Salt Company, and were soon drained. However, the land has tolerated human encroachment since the early 1800’s when farmers first converted the salt-marsh to agricultural land.
Until the 1940’s, Bair Island was an area known for its unspoiled tidal salt-marsh, tidal sloughs, and mudflats. Although it is hard to know the ecological biodiversity of the area during this time and before impairment, Bair Island now provides critical habitat for a variety of species. The reserve is home to approximately 120 fish species, 255 bird species, 81 mammal species, 30 reptile species, and 14 amphibian species – all of which rely on the wetlands for food, shelter, and breeding habitat. These species include the endangered California clapper rail (Rallus longirostris obsoletus), the salt marsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontymys raviventris), the Western snowy plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus), California least tern (Sterna antillarum browni), and the California brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis californicus). Bair Island is also an important stop for birds on the pacific flyway. Besides its ecological importance, it stands as economically viable tourist area. As a result, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife will be supporting and overseeing the Bair Island Restoration Project.
The restoration of Bair Island marsh complex will return 1, 400 acres of diked marsh to tidal marsh primarily by breaching the perimeter levees to allow tidal action via surrounding slough channels. Excavations through the internal levees will reestablish historical channels to facilitate circulation and drainage. Some levees will remain in place to provide marsh-plain habitat and to prevent shoreline erosion.
It is hoped that the restoration project will improve water quality, expand and enhance wildlife habitat and reduce mosquito (Aedes squamiger) breeding conditions by restoring tidal flow. The restoration will also give public access to the Bay shoreline and provide opportunities for public involvement and stewardship.
The goals of the restoration project are:
– restore a significant wetland complex to high quality tidal salt marsh
– maximize tidal function and habitat values in a short period of time
– enhance habitat for endangered species and native Bay wildlife
– provide opportunities for the public to learn about the Island’s unique resources by offering an on-going Community-Based Restoration programs at Inner and Middle Bair IslandAgriculture & Livestock Urban encroachment
Conversion from marsh to farmland
Dirt levees artificially put in place to reduce salt water flow and therefore creation of salt-making evaporation ponds. Until the 1940’s, Bair Island was an area of unspoiled tidal salt marsh consisting of several thousand acres of marsh, tidal sloughs and mudflats. Removing levees and allowing tidal action will eliminate prime mosquito breeding habitat and reduce the threat of mosquito-borne infection for the community. Provide habitat for endangered species, California clapper rail (Rallus longirostris obsoletus), the salt marsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontymys raviventris), the Western snowy plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus), California least tern (Sterna antillarum browni), and the California brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis californicus). Public access will be maintained by a 2.7-mile levee trail on Inner Bair Island for pedestrians enhancing educational opportunities. Community-based volunteer programs will assist with restoration of the native marsh vegetation and weed removal, providing opportunities for adults and children to participate in the restoration process at Bair Island.
The goals of the restoration project are:
– restore a significant wetland complex to high quality tidal salt marsh
– maximize tidal function and habitat values in a short period of time
– enhance habitat for endangered species and native Bay wildlife
– provide opportunities for the public to learn about the Island’s unique resources by offering an on-going Community-Based Restoration programs at Inner and Middle Bair Island

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
Portions of Bair Island are owned by the State of California as the Bair Island State Ecological Reserve (California Department of Fish and Game oversees) within an agreement to manage the state’s lands as part of the Refuge (Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge).

The project consisted on opening closed channels among different zones of the wetlandand and the river, rebuilding an accreted floodplain area upstream the wetland to buffer big floods and avoiding suspended solids enter the wetland, top soil and sediment removal from terrestrialized sites in the wetland. A significan area of the wetland close to the open water zone is now with a high variety of wetland plants after removal of common reed and increased water levels. Fire is not a good tool to remove common reed. If the restoration works are done by a team different from the planners, the probability of not developing the works correctly increase a lot and much effort is required to repair unadequate works.Agriculture & Livestock, Fragmentation, Invasive Species (native or non-native pests, pathogens or plants) Accumulation of solids deposited in the springs by floods and huge expansion of common reed. There was also lack of connectivity among sites of the wetland and the river because of structures small sluices) established in the past for water flow control and divertion for irrigation. Artifical poplar groves covered half of the roriginal floodplain area. Huge accretion by common reed detritus and inorganic solids from floods. Lack of water connectivity among zones of the wetland and the river because of water flow regulations to divert water for agriculture. The wetland is the major source of water for the river and the population in the town. A mosaic of habitats (including open water springs, floodplain, river and gallery forest, wet prairie was composing the wetland with clear high quality water. It was the initiative of the Municipality to go ahead with this project to improve the environmental conditions of this wetlands as it is very much appreciated for recreation by local people.The goals were proposed by the scientific team and discussed and finally designed after Municipality and atakeholders participation.

The project does not have a monitoring plan.
The municipalit of Monreal (owners of most of the area of the wetland) and groups of local people (farmers, fishermen, nature conservancy groups) were interested in the project as this is a reference and highly appreciated site for the people in the zone. These groups were participating during the project under the coordination of the scientific team. Planning and works were taken by the Municipality in agreement with the sponsor (Ministry of the Environment) after scientific advise and people information and participation.

Description of Project Activities: The project consisted on studying the ecological conditions of the site (Konwing topography, water levels and water quality, habitats distribution and specific composition), writing a project after people and stakeholders participation (To define work plan during 2 years including physical -top soil removal with machinery, sediment extraction with pumps-, revegetation of riparian forest), obtaining funds from different sources. Renting a company to carry out the works: top soil removal of 5 ha, sediment extraction from 25 springs, opening an acreted fllodplain area (2 ha) for flood buffering, revegetation of riparian forest along 3 km and establishing riparian systems to stop river erosion. REgular meetings were maintained with stakeholders to inform and discuss about progress and failures of the project development. Leaflet and posters were made and distributed and a nature trail is established to be followed with a simple guide. A relative large area (12 ha ) of wetland including floodplain, open water, floodable wetland zones, and increased connectivity of the wtland with the river are major results of the project. also increased value for people is very importatn. Failures include low efficiency of the works performed by a non-specialized building company and point critical times with stakeholders because of lack of coincidence with respect to the degree of naturalness and artificialization of a small site of the wetland shoudl have.  Major success of the project was to obtain an agreement with water users to let the Municipality to manage water flows from the wetland in the future to meet both irrigation demand and natural system functiong requirements. 
Eliminate existing threats to the ecosystem: Six hectares of wetland recovered and 6 hectares remain as artificial poplar grove (because lack of interest of the owner to sell the poplar grove).
Floodplain connected to the river, floodable area in the wetland.
Lutra lutra signs of new presences have been observed. Factors limiting recovery of the ecosystem: Lack of interest of one stakeholder/owner to sell part of the area (dedicated to poplar cultivation) and incorporate it to the project.
Lack of adequate direction/authority to control physical works carrried out by the constructor company. Lack of specialization of the company developing the physical works in this type of works.

Economic vitality and local livelihoods: Improved ecosystem quality for recreation of local and regional people. Slight increase of water quality for human requirements.
Qualitatively evaluated: Incorporate stakeholders at all the times of the project. Keep control and direction(authority9 of all the works under the same person/team that planned the project. Use a specialized company to carry out specific works. It is a short-term monitoring program (2 years) and then the Municipality will take control and responsability for maintenance of the works performed and the site. "
